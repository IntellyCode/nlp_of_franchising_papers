Steps in the Algorithm:
1. Analyze Pages 2, 3, and 4: Identify the most
   common font size used for the main text (i.e., introduction or body text).
2. Extract Text Matching the Main Font Size: From all pages, only extract text
   that uses the most common font size found in step 1.
3. Detect Keywords ("references", "bibliography"): Look for words like
   "references", "bibliography", or their variations.
4. Check for Boldness: If the reference-related word is found and is bold, identify
   the section following it as references, footers, or headers.
5. Filter Text: Keep only the body text that matches the identified font and size,
   and ignore text in the footers or reference sections.
