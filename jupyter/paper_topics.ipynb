    "# Topic Extraction from PDF using NLP and Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process of extracting topics from a single PDF document using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling techniques. The workflow integrates several libraries, including `gensim` for topic modeling, `PyMuPDF` for PDF parsing, `spaCy` for preprocessing and tokenization, and `pyLDAvis` for interactive topic visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PDF Parsing**  \n",
    "   The notebook uses `PyMuPDF` to read the contents of the PDF file, extracting raw text from its pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing**  \n",
    "   The extracted text is cleaned and processed using `spaCy`, which includes tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stop words, punctuations, and irrelevant tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Topic Modeling**  \n",
    "   Using the `gensim` library, the preprocessed text is transformed into a bag-of-words representation and analyzed through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent topics within the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**  \n",
    "   The results of the topic modeling are visualized using `pyLDAvis`, allowing users to interact with and explore the discovered topics and their key terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- **Preprocessed Text:** The cleaned version of the PDF content after NLP processing.  \n",
    "- **Topic Models:** A set of topics generated by LDA, including the most representative words for each topic.  \n",
    "- **Interactive Visualization:** An interactive plot to explore the relationships between topics and their distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a structured approach to extract insights from unstructured text documents, making it useful for applications like summarization, content analysis, and knowledge discovery.\n"

      "FRANCHISING LESSONS IN THE AGE OF INCIVILITY:  OPERATIONS MANUALS AND TRADE SECRETS © Robert W. Emerson, 2021* Abstract The framework for a successful franchise relationship governs procedures, performance, and standards. The franchisor agrees to lend, in effect, its intellectual property and guidance, among other things, in exchange for the franchisee’s royalties and other payments. Before entering an agreement, franchisors disclose a large bundle of information to the prospective franchisee. These data may include operational insights necessary for a franchise’s success. In practice, though, franchise operations manuals only become available to franchisees once they pay for and are bound to the franchise system. This timing, and the centrality of the manual, is the key to many franchise disputes. For example, franchisees may allege they were harmed by vague, precontractual representations about the contents of operations manuals, which in turn franchisors would justify as a way to provide required disclosures while protecting trade secrets.  When operations manuals are leaked – whether negligently, maliciously, or recklessly – or when the franchisee (or ex-franchisee) uses the manual’s processes and information without permission, then trade secret or antitrust law may impute liability. In Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners, LLC, a franchisor claimed its franchisee infringed the franchisor’s copyright by promoting a service that competed against the franchise network; while the franchisee allegedly used the franchisor’s trade secrets in spite of the two parties’ preexisting relationship barring such conduct, Molly Manners illustrates how the franchisor could have proactively amended the franchise agreement to delineate franchisee duties and prohibitions. A franchisor could file claims against its franchisee under the law of trademarks, trade secrets (e.g., the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or the Defend Trade Secrets Act), and antitrust. Lessons that emerge from this Article’s survey of franchise law and practice can serve as guiding principles for franchisors and franchisees alike.

IntroductionIf Hammurabi, ruler of ancient Babylonia and noted promulgator of a great code of law, somehow returned to Earth as a fast-food franchisor, he would face three questions: 1.The profound - How was such an incredible feat, a resurrection after nearly four millennia, See Kathryn E. Slanski, The Law of Hammurabi and its Audience, 24 YALE J.L.UMAN. 97, 101–06 (2012) (providing a detailed explanation of Hammurabi’s Law Steleaccomplished? 2. The profane – Why franchising, why fast-food?     3. The particular – What new “code” would he have?    Only the last question is easily answered. Hammurabi would establish an operations manual. At his network of hamburger outlets, McHammurabi’s “Burger Code” (its operations manual) would rule.  Certainly, any franchisor, at McHammurabi’s or wherever, would not hold the extreme, one-sided powers of a Babylonian king. Modern franchising should instead be seen as a tale of two parties, franchisor and franchisee, sometimes - perhaps often – ignorant about and also at odds with each other; and while maintaining secrecy may be a natural, human predisposition, surely business and legal issues arise between a franchisor and its franchisees if there are more secrets between them than are kept from their joint competitors and rivals. For the franchise parties aligned within their “empire” (their business network), an indeterminate equilibrium – a chaotic confluence of confidence, cooperation yet conflict - is frequently at the heart of disputes about their franchise system’s operations manual. A. Operations Manuals        The operations manual is the nucleus of a franchise. It is the foundation governing performance, procedures, and conduct, and it establishes the expectations between franchisor and franchisee. In great detail, it states the standards, specifications, and procedures with which franchisees must abide by to operate their business and adequately represent the franchisor’s brand. In short, it is the condicio sine qua non between the franchisor and the franchisee. It still may take the form of a traditional paper-bound manual, although franchisors often state in the franchise agreement that the “manual” also includes any e-mails, physical mail, or other types of documents received by the franchisee.The manual may be considered the Magna Carta or the Ten Commandments of the relationship between  That is a recurring theme not just in law, business, and franchising but also, broadly, life and literature. It is “[a] wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.” HARLES ICKENSALE OF ITIES, Book 1, chapter 3 (1859). Scott G. McLester et al., The Operations Manual—Essential to Success, 24 FRANCHISE L.J. 31, 31 (2004) (referring to the operations manual as the Bible of the franchise relationship).    W.

The American Association of Franchisees & Dealers (AAFD) has gone as far as to state that the Magna Carta was the first franchise agreement. ROBERT URVIN., TRANCHISE RAUD 20–35(1994). the franchisee and franchisor. If, for example, a franchisee runs afoul of the expectations established in the operations manual or engages in unfair competitive conduct – such as using the information in the manuals to outcompete other franchisees – antitrust laws would, arguably, be violated. In contrast, if the contents of an operations manual unreasonably restrained what a franchisee could and could not do, there would also be a violation by the franchisor. With this established framework we turn to the aptly named Civility case. Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners, LLC Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners LLC there were two Rocky Mountain enterprises whose livelihood revolved around etiquette and propriety. Both promoted “civility training solutions”indeed, their core business models emphasized “good manners and civility, and [yet] one of them stole the other’s [operations manual].” Thus, a franchising company, Civility Experts Worldwide (“Civility”), sued an independent business, Molly Manners, LLC (“Molly Manners”), alleging that Molly Manners infringed upon Civility’s copyrights with regards to three lessons used to teach manners to children. Civility alleged there was a “breach of the settlement agreement, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, copyright infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising.”To settle a dispute prior to this litigation, the parties had agreed, in 2013, that Molly Manners would remove all references to Civility’s materials; however, Molly Manners could keep materials that were explicitly licensed to Molly Manners. In this case, though, two parties, touted for their dedication to civility, good manners, and candor, could not come to an agreement. In fact, as time progressed any kind of “civility” between the parties broke down. Molly Manners moved for summary judgment on all claims stating that it adhered to the 2013 settlement agreement when it “modified its teacher guides and materials.”Civility could have proven its copyright infringement claim through either direct or indirect evidence.Proving its claim by direct evidence required Civility to “witness [the] physical act of copying.” This could be accomplished if an employee or agent of Civility saw Molly Manners reproduce Civility’s work firsthand. See, e.g., Rupert M. Barkoff, Implementing Change in a Franchise SystemEWSL. (May 2011).  Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp, 472 U.S. 585, 605 & n.32 (1985).  167 F. Supp. 3d 1179, 1187–88 (D. Colo. 2016). at 1187.

Supp. 3d at 1188). Civility Experts Worldwide, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 1187. Id. at 1188.  Id. at 1188–89. . at 1189 (citing 4-13 NIMMER ON OPYRIGHT§ 13.01[B]) (footnote omitted). It also could be proven if (1) a contact of Civility saw Molly Manners reproduce one of Civility’s lessons during the drafting, editing, or publishing phase, or (2) even without such a witness, Molly Manners had simply copied a particular lesson verbatim and without any form of originality. Civility could also have corroborated its infringement claim indirectly: this required evidence that “[Molly Manners] had access to the copyrighted work and there were ‘probative similarities between the copyright material and the allegedly copied material.’” The court held that, as a matter of law, similarities between Civility’slessons in Macaroni and Please and Molly Manners’ Nice is Right cannot be “an original selection of subjects . . . [because any set of lessons covering] manners and etiquette, especially one aimed at children, will likely [overlap and are therefore] nes  faire Due to the customary mandates of etiquette, “[t]he fact that Molly Manners’ lesson guides contain the same selection of topics, among others, was thus not an appropriate element [for imputing liability under a copyright infringement claim].”Despite the overlap in lesson content, the court found that the evidence showed that Molly Manners engaged in behaviors that were ill-fitting – indeed, unbecoming(!) - of a business that purported to teach good manners and civility. Specifically, according to the court, there was “overwhelming evidence that Molly Manners … copied from Civility[.]” However, even though there was sufficient evidence in the partial record, the court granted Molly Manners’ motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the copyright infringement claim, finding that no reasonable jury could conclude that Molly Manners’ fragmented literal similarity constituted substantial similarity to Civility’s work as a whole. The court acknowledged that Molly Manners succeeded in “intentionally [copying and] rework[ing] Civility’s[l]essons[,]” but noted that the nonfictional nature of the work left the amount of core protectable expression relatively small. Though the court granted Molly Manners’partial summary judgment on the copyright issue, the court did not grant judgment on the allegations of contract breach because Molly Manners may have failed to adhere to good faith  For a court deciding on probative similarities, it determines whether, “as a factual matter” it is “more likely than not that the defendant copied from the plaintiff’s work.” Civility Experts Worldwide, 167 F.

In essence, this case instructs us that when merely factual processes are developed, although they may be creative, the nonfiction nature of these works ordinarily fall under 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) and are typically devoid of protection. That is, copyright protections will only apply to those aspects of the work that “display the stamp of the author’s originality.”So, what is a franchisor to do if its proprietary methods and operations are disclosed? What recourse is at hand if the source of a franchise network’s success was revealed to the outside world? To assist the parties and policymakers in dealing with the aftermath of a damaging disclosure, this Article addresses, among other matters, three potential solutions, found in (1) the operations manual, (2) trade secrets law, and (3) antitrust law. While the dispute between Civility and Molly Manners ultimately was decided on the court’s analysis of U.S. copyright law, the case has strong connections to additional forms of intellectual property, such as trade secrets. Molly Manners harmed competition in a way that would prevent other businesses from competing with one another; that is, the court failed to assert, openly, that Molly Manners had stolen her competition’s product instead of finding legitimate ways to compete with its competition. This article aims to show throughout how the case could have been decided differently if Civility had acted more aggressively (rapidly Id. at 1216 (noting that the covenant requires more than simply avoiding copyright infringement).

The author’s review of 500 Franchise Disclosure Documents from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that over half of them – 270 – had clauses specifically stating that the franchisee waived any claims for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the express (quite pro-franchisor) terms of the franchise agreement negated any possible contrary terms under an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or that no covenant will imply any rights or duties inconsistent with a fair construction of the agreement’s provisions.

In relevant part, 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (2018) states that “copyright protection [does not] extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.” Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.

A search of the 38-page Civility Experts Worldwide opinion finds much discussion of Molly Manners’ alleged unfair competition and intellectual property infringement, which were after all alleged in two of the plaintiff’s five counts against Molly Manners, but not even a single reference of words such as theft, larceny, steal, pilfer, pocket, rob, filch, seize, misappropriate, grasp, purloin, grab, procure, or (in the right context) even the verbs take or acquire.    comprehensively) to protect its product, and if the court had analyzed the issues under different areas of law, such as antitrust: the Clayton Act, Sherman Act, and Lanham Act.  History Franchising, though not initially known by that name, has historic roots in feudalism and licensing grants from kings. American franchising gained its footing in the mid-1800s through brewer-licensed beer gardens, the Isaac Merrit Singer sewing machine firm, General Motors, and Rexall Drugs. Many industries use franchising as a distribution system where agency roles are determined by contract, though the legalities took time to develop. The modern franchise did not arise until roughly 1935 when Howard Johnson created the first modern restaurant franchise, approximately forty years after the passage of the first antitrust laws.     Following World War II, franchising’s popularity exploded. In 1962, the International Franchise Association estimated that over 400 companies in at least eighty different industries granted franchise rights to over 100,000 people. Accordingly, even if Congress considered franchising when drafting past antitrust laws, the antitrust law discussion is unlikely to have heavily considered implications in the franchising context. Thus, in a time where the franchise market is expected to outpace other sectors in the economy, it is appropriate to modify antitrust laws for franchises. Franchisors have argued that they should be immune from the U.S. antitrust laws, but the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the argument and continues to apply  Robert W.

Furthermore, the burden should not be placed entirely upon the judicial branch to modernize antitrust laws.

Furthermore, most judges have their careers founded in the criminal arena, which requires a vastly different analysis than a civil litigation or business suit.Operations Manuals: Examples and ElaborationsFunctions of the Operations ManualThe operations manual  serves an important function as the means by which a franchisor can alter the franchise operations without having to re-execute the franchise agreement. Franchise systems must maintain considered as a single entity for competition law considerations). “Antitrust law’s concern is whether the alleged conspirators (e.g., a franchisor and a franchisee or two franchisees) are a single entity – whether the alleged ‘contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy’ [between the franchise parties] is concerted action—that is, whether it joins together separate decisionmakers. The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether there is a ‘contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy’ amongst ‘separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,’ such that the agreement ‘deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,’ and therefore of ‘diversity of entrepreneurial interests,’ and thus of actual or potential competition.” Am.

This motivates the popularity of the Court of Chancery in Delaware, which is a court that is predominately composed of business-literate individuals. This popularity is showcased in part by the number of litigated disputes before the Chancery Court, which resulted in approximately 265 opinions and orders filed by the Court in 2020.

Without this ability, franchise agreements could be voided by changes in regulations, thus resulting in only short term agreements to allow for adaptability, which would likely affect franchise stability. In franchise agreements, franchisors will take initial steps to safeguard the right to alter the operations manual and—hence—franchise operations in general. Thus, the modifiable operations manual is the best approach for a franchisor to remain adaptable.  For example, template modification provisions exist: “Any part . . ., services, and products may in good faith be further developed, improved, changed, and modified by the Company from time to time. However, any such changes may not materially alter the economic and other terms of this agreement unless consented to in writing by franchiseeHowever, a natural conflict arises. When a franchisee signs the franchise agreement, she believes she is contracting for a certain system or operation. But there are situations where a franchisee is in fact subject to terms over which there was no  bargaining or even sufficient information. When the franchisor is able to unilaterally change the operations manual, something that is almost always a franchisor power, bullying of the franchisee may result. Several states thus have enacted legislation allowing franchisees to rescind the  McLaughlin v. Krystal Co, No. 08-0611-CG-C, 2009 WL 2514210 , at *7 (S.D. Ala.

The FDDs covered all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems. The Author found that over 90% of those franchise networks (462 of them) expressly provide to their franchisor the sole discretion to amend the operations manual; franchise contract clauses specifically acknowledge the franchisor’s right to exercise broad discretion, while specifically stating that the exercise of such discretion would not breach an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See Bagdon, supra note 48 (describing the threat that franchisees face at the hands of franchisor’s broad discretion); see also Tiffany Hsu & Rachel Abrams, Subway got too big. Franchisees paid a Price., N.Y.IMES (June 28, 2019), franchise agreement in response to drastic changes. The franchise system is traditionally franchisor-friendly, so it is important that franchisees are able to defend themselves. Thus, for example, laws should enable franchisees to resist a material change to the operations manual. In many franchise contracts, this would almost always be acceptable as “solely within the franchisor’s discretion.” Those considerable changes to the manual, though, should only be permissible under reasonable circumstances.The operations manual discusses key business concepts, such as what products may be sold, franchisee advertising capabilities, franchise color schemes, required hours of operation, employee uniforms, and other intricate business details. Traditionally, franchisees are bound by the operations manual. In other words, following the terms of the operational manual is not a choice, but a requirement. This mandate makes sense because a major attraction to the franchise business model is uniformity. For instance, a traveling consumer in an unfamiliar location can remain comfortable about her product expectations for McDonald’s because company standards are uniform across the entire country.  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/business/subway-franchisees.html (describing various tactics Subway used to bully its franchisees after 2015, causing many franchisees to fail to recoup their investments and close down, including a provision in the Franchise Agreement that allows Subway (as franchisor) the discretion to revise its rules “at any time during the term of [the] Franchise Agreement under any condition and to any extent.”). see Scott N.

See supra note 53 (discussing the “discretion” language found in 462 of 500 FDDs that the Author examined).

See Susser v. Carvel Corp, 206 F. Supp. 636, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 1962). It is vital to include these in the operations manual because the information inside the manual can be protected as confidential.

Therefore, the alteration of an operations manual requires balancing a franchisor’s need to adapt to the franchisee’s expectation of stability. Some jurisdictions, such as Connecticut, Hawaii, and New Jersey, prohibit unreasonable standards in the franchise operations manual.If a franchisor has reserved the right to modify the manual unilaterally, policy considerations must counter that right with a reasonableness standard. In Norway, for instance, appellate courts have noted the importance of considering a change’s effect on a franchisee. This balancing protection is based entirely on Norway’s judicially created laws, which still respect contractual rights. Indeed, at least two cases involving unilateral changes have resulted in a ruling in favor of franchisors.When addressing changes in an operations manual, courts also consider whether a change is material. Generally, courts do not allow the unilateral imposition of material changes. For example, a franchisor would be unable to alter a loyalty program or increase a fee beyond what is in the franchise agreement.

Another example is if the operations manual imposed an expensive remodeling requirement that was not stated in the franchise agreement, nor disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”). Miller, supra note 65. However, if a franchisor allowed a franchisee to purchase and use equipment that met the franchisor’s specifications but then mandated a specific system, the franchisor could unilaterally impose an equipment change without obtaining franchisee approval. One consideration is the specificity of the franchise agreement. For example, did the agreement specify that the change at issue was possible? If so, a court will likely allow the change.The Process for Altering a Franchise Operations Manual The process for implementing changes to a franchise’s operations manual varies among jurisdictions. For example, in California, a franchisor must notify franchisees by recording any material changes within a certain period of time in order for a modification to be effective, assuming the franchisees accepted the changes.Generally, material changes require both parties to agree to the new terms and can also require additional consideration to make the modification enforceable. On the other hand, a non-material change follows a less burdensome procedure. For instance, a franchisor may change a supplier or condiment arrangement by simply modifying the operations manual and providing franchisees with notice via a letter or email.The franchisor may impose her own limitations on the modifications, but notice is required, and such modifications require good faith. The good faith and fair dealing requirement is typically implied in all contracts and requires that all parties “exercise that discretion reasonably and with proper motive, and may not  Bores v.

Recall that the change still must have been considered in the franchise agreement. Garner, supra note 69.  Burger King Corp. v. E-Z Eating, 41 Corp., 572 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11 Cir. 2009) (noting that the franchisor reserved the right to make changes it “in the good faith exercise of its judgment believe[d] to be desirable and reasonably necessary”). do so arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties.” In other words, neither party can do anything to destroy the other party’s opportunity to enjoy the benefits of the contract. This limitation gives franchisees a chance to challenge a franchisor’s unilateral modifications to the operations manual resulting in financial detriment to franchisees. In application, for a franchisor to alter the terms of an operations manual, it should have an economic or business reason for making the change; it cannot do so on a whim. Unfortunately for franchisees, proving a good faith violation is not an easy burden to meet. For example, if a franchisor decides to increase franchisees’ supply pricing, such a change is unlikely to constitute a violation of the implied covenant. Indeed, countervailing express contract terms would prevail.. How to Avoid Litigation: Delineating Discretion, Confidentiality, and Agency The best way for a franchisee to combat potential abuse is to bargain for fewer opportunities for the franchisor to make unilateral changes. Franchise agreement negotiations would be exceptionally difficult for a franchisee with very little experience, and most franchisees generally have little bargaining power since a franchisor could likely find another franchisee. This is often true in more established franchises with national brand recognition. In fact, franchise agreements are often designed in a way that allows the franchisor to enter into a contract with multiple franchisees without having to tailor the contract to each party. Furthermore, many prospective franchisees do not consult an attorney to review the terms of the franchise agreement.Legal assistance would be well advised for franchisees because franchise agreements are typically considered enforceable so long as they are not unconscionable, deceptive, or against public policy.

When it comes to business and franchise, confidential information and trade secrets are often the most valuable company assets.However, a current or former franchisee may leak information from the manual to competitors or use the information after the franchise agreement termination. This information makes the franchise successful and unique. Business materials or trade secrets may contain information about “ingredients, cooking and preparation techniques, store equipment” and more. Therefore, it is essential to the success of a franchise to keep this knowledge confidential. When no statute directly regulates confidentiality and trade secrecy, the common law governs these issues, which franchisors have successfully used to obtain injunctions preventing further use of confidential material.The manual can also serve as evidence of an agency link between a franchisor and its franchisees.Traditionally, franchisees are viewed more along the lines of an independent contractor with respect to unconscionability is . . . dependent by reference to: (1) the relative benefit of the bargain to the parties at the time of its making; (2) the nature of the methods employed in negotiating it; and (3) the relative bargaining power of the parties.”).

App. 1997) (determining that a jury could find that McDonald’s “retained sufficient control over the [franchisee’s] daily operations [such] that an actual agency relationship existed.”). determining liability. However, franchisees have argued that because the franchise is controlled by the franchisor’s requirements that the franchisors should also be liable. A franchisee does not have much choice in whether to strictly adhere to the operating manual and other franchisor requirements because the franchisee risks the franchise agreement being terminated if the franchisor’s operating manual and other requirements are not followed. It is foreseeable that a franchisee’s compliance with the operating manual could lead to a person being injured. Courts view an extensive amount of control as sufficient to overcome the independent contractor status and impose franchisor liability for franchisee actions. For example, in Miller v. McDonald’s Corp the court held that a jury could find an agency relationship between franchisee and franchisor where the latter provided “methods for inventory control, bookkeeping procedures, business practices, and other management, advertising, and personnel policies” to which the franchisee must adhere.This extensive control, as provided for in the operations manual, creates another obstacle for franchisors to overcome. If the manual gives the franchisor control over day-to-day operations, it can result in vicarious liability for franchisee actions. In contrast, providing extremely detailed protocols for food preparation, hygiene, and sanitation may not establish this agency link. Courts seem to be more receptive towards accepting provisions in manuals that establish brand standards rather than provisions that delve into the  As this is the “traditional” view, consider the oldest version of the Restatement of Torts. RESTATEMENT IRST OF ORTS 1934)(“Except as stated in §§ 410 to 429, the employer of an independent contractor [a franchisee] is not subject to liability for bodily harm caused to another by a tortious act or omission of the contractor or his servants.”). Franchise agreements typically declare that the parties acknowledge the franchisee is an independent contractor and that the franchisee is  an agent for the principal. Emerson, supra note 53, at 697 (finding 74% of 100 franchise contracts in 2013 contained such an acknowledgment).

Western Sizzlin Corp, 857 So. 2d 71, 77 (Ala. 2003)(stating that a franchise agreement alone is not enough to make a franchisee an agent of the franchisor). Some courts give weight to situations where the franchisor “control[s] the time and manner of executing the work, as distinguished from the right merely to require results in conformity to the contract.” New Star Realty v. Jungang PRI USA, LLC, 816 S.E.2d 501, 508 (Ga. Ct. App. 2018) (referring to those factors as the “historical test”). Schlotzsky’s Inc. v. Hyde, 538 S.E.2d 561, 562 (Ga. Ct.

Franchisors may be better suited at labeling an operations manual as a “Brand Standards Manual,” which suggests the purpose is to preserve franchise goodwill and to protect the brand. Compliance should be emphasized in the franchise agreement to avoid issues of control.Unfortunately, there are no clear rules to delineate how much or what types of control a franchisor may exert without creating an agency link. For now, agency tests are determined primarily through case law.   D. Independent Contractor Statutes: No Panacea for Liability Issues Some U.S. jurisdictions have gone beyond common law to create “Independent Contractor Statutes,” which help courts determine whether a controlled party, such as a franchisee, is an independent contractor or agent. Unfortunately, for vicarious liability or other issues, these statutes often fail to provide much guidance. So, too, courts in the United Kingdom take a similar approach: if a franchisee commits a tort, a franchisor may be liable because the franchisee is a partner or agent of the franchisor because: (1) the franchisee agrees that it will (a) provide work in exchange for a payment and (b) be subject to the franchisor’s control; and (2) other provisions make the contract appear to be an employment arrangement. These factors are not likely to be present in a franchising relationship, so an employee classification or general agency relationship is also unlikely. In summation, an operations manual must be carefully crafted if it is to keep the franchisor safe from unnecessary liability.See Susan A. Grueneberg et al., Drafting Franchise Agreements After Patterson v. Domino’s: Avoiding the Minefield of Vicarious Liability and Joint Employment, 36 FRANCHISE L.J. 189, 198 (2016).  Id.  See Font v.

Civility Experts Worldwide would have been able to justifiably pursue remedies relating to trademark infringement under the Lanham Act. Under this Act, a trademark owner may register its trademark by paying a fee and filling out an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The owner must also submit a verified statement specifying that the person making the verification believes she is the owner of the mark being registered. In most cases, the trademark owner is the sole owner of the trademark; in situations where there are multiple registrants or owners, they are specified in the verified statement. In Civility v. Molly Manners Civility could have registered a specific phrase or lesson that was commonly used, thus preventing Molly Manners from being able to use those phrases or lessons. Further, Civility could have included a disclaimer within its operations manual stating which phrases belonged exclusively to Civility.  . A Brief Overview of Copyright Law and its Applicable Protections A copyright, as a form of intellectual property law, grants legal protection to original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression, from which that work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated exclusively by the copyright owner, absent a licensing agreement. Simply put, a copyright holder can prevent others from copying that work. Although it is not required for one to copyright their work, doing so is highly recommended because registration is a prerequisite for recovering damages in a federal copyright infringement case. Various statutes, including the U.S. Copyright Act, provide examples of what types of works can be copyrighted. Franchisors can copyright illustrations, creative ads, toys, and other creative works in tangible form, thereby preventing franchisees from copying those and any derivative works without a proper licensing agreement; in short, a franchisor is authorized to take actions against infringement and receive monetary or equitable remedies. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051, 1065–66, 1071 (2018). Id. § 1051(a)(1).  15 U.S.C. § 1052(d) (2018).  167 F. Supp. 3d 1179 (D. Colo. 2016).  17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (2018).  17 U.S.C. § 412 (2018) (excluding authors of visual art, as described in § 106A). 17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a)(1)–(8) (2018).  Note that a variety of legal actions that involve copyright may require the registration of the copyright. However, this can be done after the infringement has occurred. Id. § 411(a) (2018) (stating “no civil action” may be brought “until pre-registration or registration” is complete); Julia C. Colarusso et al., Intellectual Property for Franchisors in the USAEXOLOGYhttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=c7 6d64c9-e880-4df4-8d4d-2ddafe6487d6 (last visited Feb. 28, 2021) (mentioning different ways for franchisors to protect their intellectual property, including through registration). The law also provides that “[i]n no case does copyright protection . . . extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, [or] method of operation . . . regardless of the form.”  This serves as the metaphorical nail in the coffin for franchisors attempting to rely on copyright registration as the exclusive form of intellectual property protection for their processes. Regardless of how creative a franchisor’s cooking procedures are, if someone “reverse engineers” the procedure, then the franchisor cannot rely on copyright protection.Attempts to Expand Copyright Law Protections Individuals, not necessarily franchisors, have tried to expand the bounds of copyright law. For example, an attempt to have copyright law recognize “sweat equity” for a compilation of factual information including phone numbers, addresses, and alphabetically listed names failed because the respondent did not organize the factual information in an original way. Congress has also tried to extend the time limit for copyright protection, with supporters arguing that an extension was necessary to keep special work product from becoming part of the public domain. This argument ultimately failed because the U.S. Supreme Court rejected any large-scale substantive expansion of copyright concepts beyond what Constitutional framers initially intended. As evidence for this proposition, detractors pointed to the simple fact that copyrights are only allowed to exist for fixed periods of time. Though becoming more modern, copyright law is still evolving. For example, courts have agreed that computer programs are copyrightable despite being no more than a very complex process.Despite this small victory, neither courts nor legislatures have budged regarding the copyrightability of non-coding-related processes. The U.S. Supreme Court has often stated that there is no reason to extend terms beyond achieving uniformity on an international level. Thus, franchisors need another body of law to  17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (2018) (these types of intellectual property are typically protected by patents or claims of trade secrecy).  One of the earliest cases involved an attempt to copyright a rather “creative” accounting process. However, the Supreme Court determined that the process was not copyrightable. See Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 100–02, 107 (1879).  Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc, 499 U.S. 340, 359–60 (1991) (“Originality, not ‘sweat of the brow,’ is the touchstone of copyright protection”).   Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 193–98 (recounting the history of the Nation’s first copyright statute). In reviewing the “limited times” restriction in the Constitution’s Copyright Clause, the Court in Eldred rejected a challenge to Congressional extension of how long an owner’s copyright lasts (20 additional years), not a matter of expanding the substantive reach of copyright.

Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823, 836–38, 841–42 (10th Cir. 1993) (making a distinction between elements that are protectable and those that are not, and vacating the copyright infringement action, but noting that “a coherent approach to the protectability analysis” in terms of the copyrightability of computer programs has been discussed in other cases).

Holder, 565 U.S. 302, 329 (2012) (stating “Congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime” when describing 17 U.S.C. §§ 104A(c), (d), and (h)).  protect their secret information that provides an economic advantage over any competitors. This combination perfectly sets the stage for trade secrets.  IV.  Making or Taking Trade SecretsA typical trade secret is information that a person or entity does not want to be known by others, especially those within the same commercial industry. It extends further to business-related information, which can give the business a competitive advantage because trade secrets can include formulas, patterns, programs, devices, techniques, and processes. Trade secret protection is viewed as a last resort if other forms of intellectual property law fail to offer legal protection for the information. It lives in the purgatory of intellectual property: a realm in which intellectual property contains elements from the public domain while still remaining protected as unique and original ideas.The hybrid nature of trade secret law is essential in the franchising context. When other forms of intellectual property protection are not available, a franchisor can rely on trade secrecy so long as the information is actually a secret, the franchisor has made reasonable efforts to preserve the information’s secrecy, the information alleged to be a trade secret has sufficient independent economic value, and the information at issue in the trade secret context is stated with reasonable particularity. However, public policy dictates that information considered to be generally known or readily ascertainable does not qualify for trade secret protection. Perhaps the most famous example of trade secrecy involves Coca Cola’s secret formula for its soda products. When originally created, the formula was never written down, and only a small number of individuals knew the formula, mostly due to the highly proprietary nature and because the formula  Note the actual operations manual can be copyrighted since the manual is fixed and tangible and the words and arrangement are creative.

Similarly, if a franchisor were to create an extremely efficient method to operate its kitchen, a copyright could not be used to protect that process. Additionally, if a franchisor discovered that individuals respond positively to a certain advertising technique, that information is not protected through copyright. Fortunately, trade secret protection is an avenue that can provide the desired intellectual property protection. The Intersection between Franchises and Trade Secret Law  Franchisors strive to protect confidential information and procedures from leaking to their competitors, which may pertain to a franchisee’s or franchisor’s operations. For this reason, franchisors are interested and heavily invested in protecting the information given to prospective franchisees. Some examples of this information include product mix reports, marketing plans, or other franchising materials. Other examples of information the franchisors desires to protect include customer lists, financial information, marketing and sales information, distribution techniques, recipes, and business plans. In the event that a franchisee fails to protect these secrets, the franchisor will have a misappropriation claim.  Misappropriation of a trade secret is a common law tort action that encompasses the acquisition of a trade secret by someone who knows it was improperly obtained, or obtained without the appropriate consent.Traditionally, a misappropriation claim has three elements: (1) the existence of a trade secret; (2) the acquisition of the trade secret as a result of a confidential relationship; (3) the unauthorized use of the trade secret. A misappropriation claim does not arise in the event of independent invention, including reverse engineering, and can be preempted by state trade secrets statutes.Take the recent case of Handel’s Enterprises, Inc. v.

The injunction was granted, even though there was no proof that the competing ice cream shop had misappropriated franchisor trade secrets. The court recognized broad categories for trade secrets, including the operations manual, specifications, standards, and ice cream flavors and methods for creating them. The franchisor was able to enforce its intellectual property rights under the franchise agreement, but only because the trade secrets were explicit, and the franchisor knew exactly what the franchisee had misappropriated.Civility v. Molly Manners, what if Civility had made an effort to keep its materials secret and confidential? That is, what if the processes Civility used to create its lessons were trade secrets? Would Civility have had a remedy under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (“UTSA”) or the Defend Trade Secrets Act (“DTSA”)? If Civility had been able to demonstrate the steps taken to safeguard its processes, materials, and information, and if Civility also demonstrated the information provided an economic advantage, Civility may have had a claim under the UTSA or the DTSA. UTSA and DTSA: Viable Solutions to Civility’s Trade Secrets Misappropriation Claim The UTSA attempts to provide uniformity among the different states with respect to trade secret protections. It is “the primary source of trade secret law in the United States.” Under the UTSA, a trade secret is defined as “information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process[.]” Trade secret protection is only granted when the individual seeking trade secret protection derives actual or potential economic value from what is not available to its competitors. A key cornerstone of trade secrets is that they must be secret However, information does not receive trade secret Id. at 123. Id.  Id. at 124.  18 U.S.C. § 1836 (2016).

In the absence of secrecy the property disappears.”). This is so “because the ‘intrinsic value’ of a trade secret ‘is based upon, or at least preserved by, being safeguarded from disclosure.’” Amgen, Inc. v. Health Care Servs., 260 Cal. Rptr. 3d 873, 886 (Cal. Ct. App. 2020) (citations omitted).status if the information is readily ascertainable by competitors. That is, when information is so conspicuous that any reasonable individual could have access to it, the UTSA does not provide trade secret protection. Conceptually, this principle is clear — information that is accessible by all is not a secret and is not exclusively within the rights of one particular person or entity. To maintain a trade secret, the party seeking protection must make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to protect the information – reasonable efforts do not require an “extreme and unduly expensive procedure[] . . . to protect trade secrets.” Courts may also consider additional factors, such as “sweat equity.” Other methods a franchisor can take to preserve the secrecy of trade secrets are to explicitly define them within the operations manual and to mandate strict compliance within the franchise agreement. It is imperative that the franchisor state that the items listed in the franchise agreement are licensed to the franchisee as opposed to being sold.Proving a claim under the UTSA requires three elements: (1) the subject matter must qualify for trade secret protection; (2) the holder of the subject matter must establish that reasonable precautions were taken to prevent disclosure of the subject matter, and (3) the trade secret holder must prove that the information was misappropriated or wrongfully taken. Successful plaintiffs can obtain monetary damages, an injunction, or both. In addition to damages and injunctive relief, the prevailing party may also obtain attorney’s fees under the UTSA if a misappropriation claim was made in bad faith, a motion to terminate an injunction is filed in bad faith or is ignored, or there is willful or malicious misappropriation.As an additional mechanism for uniformity in trade secrecy, Congress enacted the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) in 2016 with the express purpose of providing standard guidance for the courts.

DTSA was enacted, a party suing for trade secret misappropriation was limited to state court unless there was federal diversity jurisdiction. State laws about trade secret misappropriation vary from state to state, but DTSA provides a nationwide statute that can be applied in federal court. Thus, DTSA provides an “additional tool for American companies, especially those with a national footprint, to enforce their intellectual property rights.” Though litigants pursuing misappropriation claims can now bring suit at the federal level, trade secret law is still largely governed by state trade secret law because the DTSA does not preempt state law remedies for misappropriation. Nevertheless, plaintiffs can now bring misappropriation claims in federal or state court. Similar to the UTSA, the DTSA allows a prevailing party in trade secret litigation to be awarded attorney’s fees in civil actions, subject to court discretion.The DTSA is modeled after the UTSA, and was enacted as an amendment to the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996. Both the DTSA and UTSA require proving that the subject matter qualifies for trade secret protection as the first element of any trade secret claim. The DTSA provides a narrower definition for what type of information qualifies as a trade secret than the UTSA because the DTSA has an exhaustive definition for what constitutes protected material. Conversely, the UTSA only provides guidance as to what constitutes a trade secret. Although both laws provide broad definitions, the DTSA provides a list of items that are trade secrets – exhaustive and specifically defined – related directly to commerce. Bret A. Cohen et al., Explaining the Defend Trade Secrets Act, 2016 BODAY 1, 1 (2016). Id.

The second element for a misappropriation claim under both the UTSA and DTSA is that the information is “subject to efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.” Put simply, the holder of the trade secret has the burden of providing notice of the confidential nature of the information to all parties to whom the trade secret is disclosed. The amount of protection required varies from industry to industry. In some instances, a “reasonable effort” is simply to have the parties sign a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”), which provides a contractual obligation to protect trade secrets and serves as notice to the employee or possessor of the secret that the information must be protected. It may also be in the franchisor’s best interest to have all parties involved in the franchise sign a NDA. For example, franchisors should require not only franchisees to sign NDAs, but also any managers that the franchisee entrusts with the trade secrets. NDA provisions maintained within franchise agreements should be supported by identified trade secrets not “only generally, but more specifically in the operations manual” as a preventative measure.franchisor may also provide these individuals with just parts of the trade secret so that no one person has the entire secret. Further, the NDA can require signees to maintain secrecy even after the business relationship has ended.If a former employee was given access to a virtual database, the ex-employer must now make efforts to See Richard F. Dole, Jr., Identifying the Trade Secrets at Issue in Litigation Under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, 33 SANTA LARA IGH L.J. 470, 474 (2017). This is a requirement in both the UTSA and the DTSA, despite the DTSA having different language regarding this requirement. Compare UTSA § 1(4)(ii) (1985) (“efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy”), with 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3)(A) (2016) (“taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret”).

Similarly, if a former employee was given physical property containing trade secrets, it would also be in the ex-employer’s best interest to recover that property. In fact, franchisees often continue using trade secrets after the franchise agreement is no longer valid. In Nova Scotia Ltd. v. Donna’s Seashore Investments Ltd., the defendant’s franchise was terminated, and the franchisor sued because of the continued use of its trade secrets. The Civility case had a similar situation because Molly Manners originally used the Civility materials in accordance with its license, but incorporated portions of Civility’s materials into its own programs.Courts have long spoken of the multiple elements of a trade secret: A trade secret can “exist in a combination of characteristics and components, each of which, by itself, is in the public domain, but the unified process, design and operation of which, in unique combination, affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret.” For instance, a court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Coca-Cola on all counts of a trade secret misappropriation claim for an embossed label because of independent development by proper means based on information that was partially disclosed in a patent application. Though the court noted that independent creation or reverse engineering does not constitute misappropriation, it reaffirmed the principle that trade secrets can exist in a combination of components. The Civility case raises a novel issue with respect to how franchises can use intellectual property laws to protect their information. While copyright and trademark law offer remedies for franchisors regarding how to protect their intellectual property, the question here is whether intellectual property laws will protect secret information when they are part of the franchise’s operational procedure – that is, whether trade secret law will protect secrets stolen from franchisors or disseminated to the public in violation of a NDA.

The distinction of outcomes, based on contract law versus tort law, can be vital. For example, in Williams-Sonoma Direct, Inc. v. Arhaus LLC a trade secret dispute based in contract law, the court found in favor of the plaintiff for claims of misappropriation because the defendant utilized proprietary information for financial gain, which was obtained from plaintiff’s former high level employee that was subject to an NDA specifically detailing the confidential information and other protective measures. In another contract claim involving disclosure of trade secrets despite a valid NDA contract, the court dismissed the case because the plaintiff did not take reasonable steps to maintain secrecy of its plan to develop bubblegum packaging in a wheel design. Specifically, the court took issue with plaintiff’s failure to designate information as “confidential” in accordance with the terms of the NDA. While trade secret misappropriation claims may have a higher chance of success when a NDA contract is involved, there are some instances in which tortious misconduct in the absence of a NDA can be successful. For instance, the court in PMC, Inc. v. Kadisha held that a corporate officer could be liable for intentional tortious conduct if the officer invested in a corporation who’s intellectual property assets (i.e. trade secrets) were knowingly obtained through unlawful conduct and the officer investing with the intent to use the unlawfully obtained information for economic gain. Another example of tortious misconduct in trade secret misappropriation claims may arise after a contract has been terminated, but one party creates a defective adaption of a product subject to trade secret protection such that reputational damage results. In essence, the difference between misappropriation in contract disputes as opposed to tort disputes is not a defendant’s alleged bad acts, which exist in both instances, but is instead the existence of—and adherence to—a NDA contract. There are lessons to be learned from Civility Experts. Had Civility included a NDA as a condition of franchising and receiving a copy of its operations manual, Civility may have had a claim under trade secrets ATRICK USTONAW OF RADE ECRET EGULATION UNDER THE NIFORM RADE ECRETS 32 (2d ed. 2020) (citing cases for the proposition that trade secret status under nondisclosure or noncompete agreements – i.e., information qualifying as a trade secret in such contract-based cases - may not constitute a trade secret under noncontractual claims, such as those found under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act). 109 F.

However, barring those circumstances, it is unlikely that Civility would have a remedy under intellectual property laws—seeing as the court stated that Civility was ineligible for copyright protections.Civility claimed that the processes it developed with its material was protected by copyright law—that the processes were original works of authorship. The court disagreed and stated that developing lessons for manners is not original, but rather, something that is well-known and not creative – scènes à faireFollowing the United States’ example, in 2016 the European Union created trade secret laws called the Trade Secrets Directive (“TSD”). The TSD was aimed at unifying the laws related to trade secrets. The TSD defines trade secret by stating[I]t is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question; it has commercial value because it is secret; it has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret.” This definition of trade secret is the same as the 1994 WTO TRIPS definition of trade secret. It is relatively the same as the definition for Denmark, Spain and Italy, but it changes the definition more in countries like UK, Germany, Sweden, Poland and Hungry. Note that trade secret law would not likely support a claim regarding information actually told to the various workshop participants. The information does provide an economic advantage, but the information is not reasonably protected. For example, someone interested in developing a manners workshop would simply attend the workshop to learn Civility’s material. However, trade secret protection could extend to certain teaching approaches in treating workshop participants and other information that is reasonably protected. Another possible example would be to have all attendees sign a nondisclosure agreement, which may be hard to do since Civility’s target audience is children.  Civility Experts Worldwide v.

(L 157) (EU) (clarifying that “[t]his Directive lays down rules on the protection against the unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure of trade secrets.”). As one author explains:   [The TSD is a] so-called “minimum harmonisation device” meaning that Member States have the possibility--if they wish--to put in place wider trade secret protection, provided that the safeguard measures expressly provided for in the Directive to protect the interests of third parties are respected. However, even if a Member State does not put such protection in place, pursuant to Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the wording and the goals of the Directive must be observed when national law is applied.Kevin Nachtrab, The Trade Secrets Directive, 54 LES OUVELLES 165, 165 (2019), https://www.lesi.org/publications/les-nouvelles/les-nouvelles-online/september-2019; see also UNDAMENTALS OF RANCHISING UROPE 36 (Robert A.

UNDAMENTALS OF RANCHISING UROPE 36 (Robert A. Lauer & John Pratt, eds., 2017).     Not only does the TSD create a uniform policy for trade secret management in the European Union, but it also defines unlawful acquisition and remedies, though criminalization for misuse of trade secrets is not a possibility. Similar to trade secret protection in the United States, the TSD provides for a cause of action when a confidentiality agreement or NDA has been breached. Under article 4(3), the TSD specifically provides that use or disclosure will be considered unlawful when: “[W]ithout the consent of the trade secret holder . . . a person . . . is found to meet any of the following conditions: (a) [to have] acquired the trade secret unlawfully; (b) [to be] in breach of a confidentiality agreement or any other duty not to disclose the trade secret; [or] (c) [to be] in breach of a contractual or any other duty to limit the use of the trade secret.”Successful litigants are offered various remedies, including injunctions; prohibitions on production, marketing, and sale of infringing goods; seizure or delivery of infringing goods, including electronic information;       court-ordered recalls, alterations, or destruction; publicized judgments; and reverse engineering.On the other hand, trade secret law under both the UTSA and the DTSA provide intellectual property protection for both individuals and businesses who develop proprietary procedures. This means if a business takes well known information to develop a process and creates economic gain from this process, both the UTSA and the DTSA provide trade secret protection and a remedy for misappropriation. Here, it is likely that under the UTSA or DTSA, Civility would have had a remedy against Molly Manners. The information was not known to its competitors, the information provided Civility with a competitive advantage, and the NDA was a reasonable step to protect the information. Civility would be entitled to breach of contract damages, royalties, injunctions, and other remedies that the court may find appropriate. Other remedies may include attorney’s fees if the misappropriation was made in bad faith. Council Directive 2016/943, arts.4(2)-(5), 6(1), 9(1), 12(1)–(4), 14, 16, 2016 O.J.

There is one major hiccup with trade secrets; recall that independent creation voids the trade secret protection, at least with respect to that party. For example, if Molly Manners had no prior contact with Civility and independently came up with the same ideas that Civility used, Civility would not have a misappropriation claim. Independent creation is dangerous to businesses or franchises with secrets that are not necessarily complex or unique. Although marketing strategies and procedures may be creative, they are not always enough to meet the requirements for protection. If franchise processes were public information or the franchisor failed to keep the trade secrets private, a purported misappropriator could simply point to public documents to show that identified trade secrets are not secret at all, thus failing to meet one of the elements required for protection. The defendant and purported misappropriator is able to use its own documents, records, and financial data to show that it made no use of the plaintiff’s information to show there was no misappropriation. Therefore, if a franchisor attempts to protect its processes as trade secrets and another franchisor develops the same idea through its own efforts, the franchisor would not have a legal claim. The Potential of a Trade Secret Registry to Protect Both Franchise Parties Before analyzing the specifics of what a trade secret registry applicable to franchises would look like, it will be helpful to first explore the attributes that should be present to establish the type of registry this article posits could be implemented. The trade secret registry should be an international registry, so as to reflect the international nature of the franchise industry; it should exist in an online format to permit all interested parties ease of access. The purpose of the registry would be to “identify the owners of the trade secret rights . . . but not to disclose the secrets themselves.” An effective trade secret registry will primarily have security measures in place to protect the owner’s asset (the trade secret), while also meeting the public notice requirement (informing the public that a particular idea is protected without revealing proprietary information  Independent creation is a “defense asserting that a later work is not a derivative of an allegedly inferior work, but is a product of coincidentally parallel labor.” Independent CreationLACKICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019); What is independent creation?, http://www.quizlaw.com/trade_secrets/ what_is_independent_creation.php (last visited Feb. 19, 2021) (providing an alternate definition of Independent creation as “where someone creates, on [his/her] own, the same technology or information which someone else claims as a trade secret. If this independent creation did not wrongfully use any part of the claimed trade secret, then the creator is free to use it as he or she sees fit, without needing to seek the trade secret owner’s permission, and is not liable for trade secret misappropriation.”).

Vinizky, supra note 217, at 496.  that could comprise the secret). In the event of a security breach, where a third party hacker breaks into the registry and steals deposited trade secrets, various remedies are available: either the registry can be insured with high policy limits and/or the registry can provide an insurance fund (financed by trade secret owner registration fees) to compensate owners for damages. Operators of the registry would be civilly liable to the registered trade secret owners for breach of contract and negligent handling of the registry.Second, an effective trade secret registry for franchises will be judged on reducing various costs: transaction, litigation, financing, and employment costs. As long as a franchise does not conflict with the operating manual terms detailing trade secrets, either a franchisor or franchisee could enter the trade secret information as encrypted information on the registry (saved as a unique file). To ensure the authenticity of ownership, individuals inputting information should sign with an approved electronic signature.Subsequent updates to the initial entry could be made in real time, replacing the file where the original entry is located on the registry. This article recommends that only the individual who inputted the trade secret information into the registry, and his or her agents or subordinates, would be allowed to make updates to that original entry. The registry would allow members of the general public to view the name of various owners, the names of their agents and subordinates who made updates, as well as date and time in which the information was input (or updated) into the registry.  To engage in transaction related to the trade secret, the  Vinizky, supra note217,at 486–87. As with other firms who receive and store consumers’ data, perhaps the FTC could be granted the authority to impose certain obligations on the registry’s registrar and other registry employees to protect the security of consumer provided information while also file enforcement actions against the registrar and his or her employees for failing to provide “reasonable” measures to protect the security of the owner’s trade secret data. See, e.g., Daniel J. Solove & Woodrow Hartzog, The FTC and the new Common law of Privacy, 114 COLUM. 583, 604 (2014); FRADE TART WITH ECURITYUIDE FOR USINESSESSONS EARNED FROM ASES (2015), https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/start-security-guide-business.Id. at 530. Arguably, a trade secret owner’s act of depositing his, her, or its trade secret into an online encrypted trade secret registry satisfy the reasonable secrecy precautions (“RSP”) requirement.  Deepa Varadarajan, Trade Secret Precautions, Possession, and Notice, 68 HASTINGS L.J. 357, 360 (2017). The RSP requirement is a necessary element (under the UTSA and the DTSA) that the trade secret owner must meet to obtain trade secret protection, i.e., the owner must “engage in reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information for which protection is sought.” ; Dole, Jr., supra note 176.  Vinizky, supra note 217,at 530. Id. at 484. Optimally, the registry’s benefits should exceed the costs of establishing and operating the registry, as well as overcome additional public costs (e.g., the means of acquiring initial ownership of the trade secret; the means for transferring ownership of it; and the creation of secondary rights for permitted uses of it). Id. at 484–86. Vinizky, supra note 217, at 488. The information would also need to be encrypted when saved onto the registry. Id. & n.80.   Id. at 488.

Vinizky proposes that there should not be a preliminary ownership verification step before inputting the trade secret into the registry; thus, the registration itself would not constitute as definitive proof that the material is a trade secret. Vinizky, supra note 217, at 493. Further, “[r]egistration of information as a trade secret with the proposed registry [would] not necessarily create the trade secret.” Id. at 496.  registrant would need to list the names of all contracting parties and list the secret on the registry in his/her/its name. Similarly, if either party to a franchise agreement were to transact with each other or with a third party relating to an unregistered trade secret (one not in the registry), then any such transaction would be void until the secret is officially registered in the registry.The registry’s public notice function will be useful in various scenarios. The registry’s public notice aspect can prevent fraudulent transactions, such as when an terminated franchisee attempts to sell his former franchisor’s trade secret to the franchisor’s competitors (and vis versa). Similarly, the registry’s notice function can also assist franchisors in screening potential franchisees who may have access or knowledge about other franchisors’ trade secrets; without performing this check, the current franchisor could be liable for trade secret misappropriation for executing a franchise agreement with a franchisee who possesses knowledge of a former franchisor’s trade secret.The registry can also assist the parties in the franchise relationship by lowering the transaction costs associated with trade secrets litigation. Indeed, in the event of a legal dispute where one party challenges the legitimacy of another party’s ownership of trade secret, the registrar(s) of the trade secrets registry and his or her employees are the only ones that should be allowed to peruse the trade secret to comply with discovery requests or judicial request for the material.  The registrars, along with their employees and the experts they hire, will need to be bound by a duty of confidentiality to the trade secret owner as third party certifiers,similar to the one applicable to a patent registrar and his or her employees.  In addition, depositing a trade secret into the registry clears up issues of when it came into existence (there is a record date); similarly, the trade secret registrar’s certification of what exactly the owner deposited (in general terms) as the trade secret can be used as prima facie evidence regarding the scope of the secret. Similarly, claims of trade secret misappropriation can be filed with ease since the owner of the trade secret can use the registry to identify Id. at 494.

Registration of a trade secret on a proposed registry such as this could be used a litigation proceeding as prima facie evidence of intent to protect a trade secret; absent a showing that the registered secret was well-known or the registrant used reasonable efforts to protect her secret, courts are likely to assume that the registered trade secret was reasonably protected.

Indeed, suppose that a franchisee was in negotiations with a well-known franchisor to transfer the franchisee’s trade secret (which was already deposited in the registry) to the well-known franchisor. Suppose further that negotiations break down, but the franchisee learns later on that the well-known franchisor had been using the franchisee’s trade secret in the interim.  Assuming that the well-known franchisor did not register similar information prior to negotiations, a strong evidentiary presumption exists that the franchisee disclosed his secret to the well-known franchisor during negotiations and that the franchisor used it illegally. Alternatively, assuming that the negotiations went well, recording the transfer of the trade secret from the franchisee to the well-known franchisor is easy: the franchisee’s title on the registry would display “former owner” while the well-known franchisor’s title on the registry would display “current owner.”Maintaining these titles displayed in the registry for a reasonable time (perhaps five years) after the transfer occurs is likely to deter “former owners” from succeeding in reselling the secret. The same deterrent effect can apply to situations where former franchisees (of a well-known franchisor) attempt to sell the franchisor’s trade secret to one of the franchisor’s competitors without disclosing the source of the secret, or when a licensee who possesses an exclusive license to use a trade secret (obtained from the owner) attempts to either register himself as owner of the trade secret on the registry or to attempts sell the Id. at 505.   A similar hypothetical is presented in Vinizky, supra note 217, at 510. Id. The well-known franchisor can refute this presumption by presenting evidence that the information was in its possession before the negotiations took place. Id.

Of course, this scenario can well have the parties in reverse, with a franchisor’s trade secret and a franchisee’s access to, and possible theft or misappropriation of, that secret.   Id. at 512. According to the procedures of the proposed trade secret registry, a former owner of a trade secret who attempts to resell a trade secret would have to register again as owner of the trade secret. Id. at 512. In this scenario, the trade secret registrar would perform a conflict check (as it would do for any initial registration of a secret) between the status of the secret and the potential registrant/seller (who’s in actuality the “former owner” of the secret in this scenario). Vinizky, supra note 217, at 512. If the trade secret registrar discovers that the secret information is similar to the one that the potential seller had transferred previously, he would be allowed to prevent the transaction from happening. Id. Further, the registrar should have the discretion to disclose the attempted fraudulent sale to the current owner of the secret; this is akin to the Model Rule allowing a lawyer to permissively disclose confidential information relating to the representation of a client “to prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result” (emphasis added).

The TRIPS Agreement also sets minimum standards for enforcing intellectual property rights.    A similar approach to trade secrets is taken abroad. International treaties concerning intellectual property require countries to protect undisclosed information, otherwise known as trade secrets. One major treaty requires countries to offer protection to information that is (1) a secret, (2) has commercial value because it is a secret, and (3) is protected by reasonable steps under the circumstances. The language parallels the requirements for domestic protection, which is comparable to the United States’ participation in TRIPS. TRIPS facilitates the ability of international franchisors to obtain protection wherever it is authorized. TRIPS article 41, in combination with TRIPS article 46, give individuals the right to take legal action to protect their trade secrets through pre-emptive actions. 248 This can be done through legal actions such as non-disclosure agreements or through litigation. International enforceability of non-disclosures is vital to protecting the contents of an operations manual. The non-disclosure agreement should explicitly state that the franchisee or potential franchise must remain silent regarding any facts he comes across while negotiating the franchise agreement, regardless of where the information comes from, such as from an operating agreement.Despite the existence of TRIPS, a country may go above those requirements and provide a franchisor or franchisee additional protection with respect to trade secrets.

Martina Parusova Zimova, Czech RepublicNTERNATIONAL RANCHISING CZR-1, CZR-4 (Dennis Campbell ed., 2nd ed. 2019legislation and franchise specific legislation designed to address the intricacies of franchise law. Franchise specific legislation has also been internationally implemented in regard to operations manuals, such as in the United Kingdom. As franchisors adapt to the new EU laws, proactive trade secret protection is important to prevent exploitation and disclosure of previously private processes that may have been subject to different regulations. For example, in Denmark, franchisors were previously treated as suppliers and franchisees as independent distributors, so enactment of the TSD may result in new trade secret concerns for franchisors.Likewise, in Sweden, the operations manual, which covers prohibitions of making copies of the manual and secrecy aspects, is seen as a loan of franchisor information that terminates when the franchise agreement terminates. In Sweden, operations manuals are considered to have originality needed to get copyright protection. In Italy, the information in operating manuals are protected by copyright law, and the know-how that is contained in the manual must be safely kept by the franchisee, cannot be copied by franchisees for third parties and the franchisee must return it at the end of the term for the franchise agreement. In Malaysia, the Franchise Act requires the franchisee to provide a written guarantee that the franchisee and the franchisee’s directors, spouses, immediate family members of directors, and employees will not disclose the information in the operations manual to anyone. Other countries that allow operations manuals to receive copyright protection are Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Cypress, Denmark, Italy,  and Singapore. Some countries do not have regulations regarding operating manuals, like in the Czech Republic, which says that the operating manual itself should regulate its use. Therefore, it is possible to  Franchises are unique because disclosure to many parties is necessary. Consider a manufacturer with manufacturing trade secret.

It never has to leave the factory, which helps with protecting the secret. In the franchise context, the franchisor must expose these secrets to all franchisees and the franchisees expose those secrets to its employees.

Franchisors would be best suited by developing creative, original content in their operating manuals, ensuring that they would be protectable under copyright law as well as trade secret law. While there are varying approaches worldwide, a well-planned out operating manual and franchise agreement can serve as the basis for franchisor copyright and trade secret protections. A well-constructed manual will help protect the franchisor’s brand reputation and credibility, and further serve as the basis for the obligations that the franchisee must follow. It is when a franchisor-franchisee relationship terminates or a trade secret is no longer in use that issues arise about better franchise network service.  Economic Efficiency and Commercial Value Considerations Another area to consider is what happens to trade secrets no longer in use. In other words, if a franchisor utilized a process but then eventually replaced it, does the former process still receive protection? To be under continued protection, the trade secret must remain commercially valuable. One proposed standard is that commercial value – the worth of a business –  must stem from the secret’s ability to be used in making a trade commodity, an idea that dates back to ancient civilizations trading in items like spices and seashells. The power of those civilizations was seen as proportionate to the civilization’s ability to manage a commodity exchange and hold onto secrets.Another standard states that a trade secret’s value is determined by whether the secret gives the holder a competitive edge over its competition. Therefore, if the information becomes obsolete, it provides no value and cannot be a trade secret. This analysis should be done for specific franchisors and not a secondary market. For example, a trade secret does not retain its commercial value because it could be valuable in a secondary market – its value should be measured in the context of its value to the entity who is seeking enforcement of trade secret law with respect to the entity’s proprietary practices, procedures, or products.Policy dictates that information no longer in use should not be subject to trade secret protection. See Chris Simboli, Intellectual Property Law Considerations for Business Lawyers, 61 TDVOC. 38, 39 (2018) (noting that trade secret protection can last in perpetuity as long as it remains secret or confidential).   Taylor v. Babbitt, 760 F. Supp. 2d 80, 88 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing the plaintiff’s assertion).   Nick K. Lioudis, Commodities Trading: An OverviewNVESTOPEDIA (May 21, 2019), https://www.investopedia.com/investing/commodities-trading-overview/.  Id.  Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co, 467 U.S. 986, 1011 n.15 (1984) (“We emphasize that the value of a trade secret lies in the competitive advantage it gives its owner over competitors.”). Taylor, 760 F. Supp. 2d at 88.  Id. See id. at 89 (“[The materials] are not commercially valuable because their economic value does not derive from the competitive advantage they confer upon Fairchild within the antique aircraft market.”). Economic principles, on the other hand, hold that unused resources should be distributed in order to maximize efficiency. Economic efficiency is when every resource is used in the best way possible to serve the needs of individuals and entities while waste and inefficiency are minimized. In other words, nothing can be changed in a way that makes one part better without making another part worse off. Therefore, even though a business may no longer use it, another individual may be able to use that obsolete system or adapt it for his or her own purposes. This creates a maximum efficiency, which benefits the economy in the long run. On the other side of that argument is business owner consideration. The framers of the constitution undoubtedly considered intellectual property in drafting the document, as evidenced by the express protections granted to science and innovations. Without such protections, franchises would be harmed because free riders could gain all of the benefits from the intellectual property without doing any of the work. If people were able to just wait until someone else invented an idea, there would be little incentive research and development. Discovery of a new and innovative idea normally takes a substantial amount of resources, dedication, and time, which usually requires some sort of incentive or payout. A franchisor may dedicate significant revenue toward reformulating advertising strategies, secret sauces, or production lines. If a franchisor creates a new recipe, the old recipe may not necessarily lose its value even though the old recipe simply sits in the back of the franchisor’s intellectual property drawer. Take for example the McDonald’s McRib recipe. The McRib is not always on the menu, and should not lose its value just while it is sitting in the franchisor’s intellectual property drawer; when the McRib is placed on the menu, for limited times, it is a popular item for the franchisor. A way to try to protect trade secrets is to have a confidentiality agreement with franchisees in tandem with a trade secret protection policy.Therefore, another balancing act is required between the need to allocate resources for efficiency versus the need to incentivize business owners to develop and protect their processes. An ex-franchisee may still remember a sauce and be able to use it for a different purpose. This allows the creation of a new business and the competition necessary for our capitalist economy is satiated. However, this may result in franchisors being hesitant in updating their trade secrets due to fear of losing them in the public domain.

One could say that is comparable to the legal principle of adverse possession in real property law. Marya Baron, Weeks v.

For a discussion on the framers’ intent, see Dotan Oliar, Making Sense of the Intellectual Property Clause: Promotion of Progress as a Limitation on Congress's Intellectual Property Power, 94 GL.J. 1771 (2006).

Thus, to solve the problem with non-used trade secrets, a focus should be placed on the business’ use of the trade secret.  A trade secret may be classified as information known to only a small number of people in an industry, with the benefit coming from the small number of businesses that can use the information to their advantage. If a franchise’s secret becomes unused, the franchisees are among the few individuals privy to such information. The trade secret still may retain most of its value. In proving commercial value, an exact science should not be required. A business should not necessarily have to give a specific date on which the value will arise. Let us return to the McDonald’s McRib previously mentioned. It may not be used by the franchisee all the time because the item is only offered as a special during “McRib season” but the McRib’s recipe is considered a trade secret of McDonald’s. The franchisors and franchisees are among the few individuals privity to the recipe and provides value to those involved.  Lastly, establishing a lease-like relationship may benefit both parties. In such a situation, if a franchisee operated the franchise effectively for a specified term in the lease, the franchisee would be able to keep some of the trade secrets after the franchise relationship is terminated. This would create a less daunting investment to franchisees because they would be able to continue using parts of their investment instead of franchise-specific things going to waste. This mechanism would give franchisors a stronger advertising incentive as well as a more amicable relationship with the franchisee. Another benefit this mechanism would have for franchisors is the ability to pick which trade secrets to allow a franchisee to continue to use and which to keep for future use. Also, a franchisee would not have to worry about future claims from franchisors for trade secret infringement. If the franchisor kept some of the trade secrets after the relationship ended, then the trade secret would belong to the franchisee at that point and not the franchisor. A reason this is a benefit for franchisees is also why it is a hardship for franchisors. If franchisors give parts of their trade secrets to franchisees, the  Robert Unikel, Bridging the “Trade Secret” Gap: Protecting “Confidential Information” Not Rising to the Level of Trade Secrets, 29 LL.J. 841, 851 (1998). While this type of information may not necessarily be a trade secret (because unrelated groups may discover the information independently), the same logic can still be used to define the value of a trade secret.  In a lawsuit for misappropriation of a trade secret, one may ask what should be required: A mere showing that the trade secret had value to the owner or that provides a competitive advantage to other businesses if allowed into the public domain?  In other words, a sauce recipe, for instance, has value because of the time that it took to develop it; even if the new recipe is objectively better, misappropriating even the older recipe might lessen the gap between industry leader X and competitor Y, who has directly acquired X’s old recipe or at least seen it fall into the public domain.

Trade secrets provide an array of benefits and concerns for a franchisor. Trade secret law covers intangible property that deserves protection but falls outside copyright, patent, or other forms of intellectual property. However, to retain a commercial benefit from the information requires franchisors to remain ever vigilant, which can be extremely costly.   The Applicability of U.S. Antitrust Law      In Civility v. Molly Manners, it was alleged that Molly Manners stole the information from Civility’s operations manual and used the information to establish its own set of videos to teach children about manners and mannerisms. There was no conduct that would fall under the purview of the Sherman Act, the federal statute that bans restraint on trade and monopolization, because there were no actions that unreasonably restrained trade, no mergers, or combining of directorates. It would likewise not fall under the Clayton Act because there was no contract or agreement that would unreasonably restrain trade and there was no intent or conspiracy to monopolize. Civility’s only choice for recourse was under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which specifically proscribes any type of deceptive or unfair behavior which affects commerce, there was a possibility for Civility to obtain a remedy. Unfortunately, Civility could not bring the claim itself but would have to wait for the FTC to take action.The court determined that had Civility developed a more extensive set of evidence, it may have demonstrated that Molly Manners intentionally undermined the previous settlement agreement for its own benefit and intentionally used the videos and processes to develop its own lessons. If that were the case, Civility would likely have been able to demonstrate that Molly Manners, through unfair or deceptive practices, obtained this information and used it to undermine Civility’s economic position in the marketplace. This would further have brought the issue under the shadow of the Sherman Act and exposed Molly Manners to the  Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners, LLC, 167 F. Supp. 3d 1179, 1187–88 (D.

Nothing in the case indicated that Civility would be entitled to receive the portion of income that its materials created. Perhaps the best outcome for Civility would have resulted if Civility had required Molly Manners to sign an NDA specifying each trade secret at issue because Civility could have brought a misappropriation claim. So long as the agreement stated the trade secrets with adequate particularity, Civility’s lawsuit likely would have had a different result. A Brief Overview of the Sherman, Clayton, and Federal Trade Commission Acts Antitrust laws have had the same basic objective since the inception of the Sherman Act in 1890: “To protect the process of competition for the benefit of the consumer, making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently, keep prices down, and keep quality up.” Antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman and Clayton Acts, were implemented to prevent unreasonable restraints of trade. Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits any type of contract, agreement, conspiracy, or combination thereof from restricting trade. Any type of behavior in restraint of trade, such as price fixing, cartel-like structures, or collusion between competitors –  including certainly all types of competition law behaviors associated with franchising and the professional or educational endeavors of the franchise bar and academia – is subject to both criminal and civil liability under the Sherman Act.In addition to these types of examples of trade restraints, the legislature and regulatory bodies have The Antitrust LawsRADE , https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws (last visited Jan. 10, 2021).

United States, 345 U.S. 594, 609 (1953) (“[T]he Clayton Act’s more specific standards illuminate the public policy which the Sherman Act was designed to serve”).     15 U.S.C. § 1 (2018) provides that “every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.”   United States v.

Jonathan Solish, Franchising 101: Key Issues in the Law of Franchisinghttps://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2010/03/01_solish The American Bar Association’s (“ABA’s”) Committee on Franchising was first housed within the ABA’s Antitrust Law Section.  Only later did the ABA’s Forum on Franchising form, ultimately as a group within the ABA distinct from any other particular group or section. H. Stephen Ward, Editor’s Column, Newsletter of the Forum Committee on Franchising, 1 A 2, 2 (1980).   Indeed, franchise law is a modern development and most law schools do not have educational resources discussing this issue. It was finally recognized as a distinct area of law in 2009 and it is extremely popular as a method of developing a business. Thus it should be treated as a separate entity and have its own legislation instead of heavily relying on other areas of law. See Rupert M. Barkoff, Franchise Law as an Academic DisciplineRANCHISINGASESATERIALS ROBLEMSsupra note 32,at xxv, xxvi-xxxi (citing, inter alia, State ex. rel. Couns. for Discipline v. Orr, 759 N.W.2d 702 (Neb. 2009)).    This begs the question: In the franchising context, do antitrust laws miss the mark? Antitrust laws were written when “new technology meant ‘typewriters, buggy whips and bicycles.’” Fiona M. Scott Morton, Is Antitrust Enforcement Out of Date?,ALE NSIGHTS (July 10, 2018), https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/is-antitrust-enforcement-out-of-date. codified certain behaviors that are so egregious and clearly unreasonable that they are illegal per se In other words, the conduct is illegal and there is no need to consider whether the behavior actually affected trade. However, in contrast with per se conduct, any other type of behavior that arguably restricts trade is subject to a “rule of reason” analysis. This doctrine is fundamental to antitrust analysis.  The Sherman Act only restricts behavior that unreasonably restricts trade. A court must analyze and weigh both the pro-competitive benefits of the challenged conduct against the anticompetitive effect of that conduct, and prohibit conduct which, on balance, is anticompetitive. In 2019, the EU opened an investigation into Amazon for its dual role in being a marketplace and retailer to use data from the company’s merchants against the merchants. The same week Amazon reached a settlement with Germany with the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. In addition to proscribing contracts, agreements, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, the Sherman Act also forbids monopolies, attempts to monopolize, and conspiracies to monopolize.A second piece of antitrust legislation, the Clayton Act, “prevents and eliminates contracts, corporate mergers and acquisitions, and interlocking directorates.” Congress gave broad discretion to the agencies to enforce antitrust laws. With the implementation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), Congress sought to curtail and prevent “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or deceptive acts.” The FTCA established the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the regulatory body empowered to enforce the antitrust laws and to punish those businesses and individuals who would undermine – through unfair practices – commerce.The FTCA was implemented in the same spirit as the Sherman Act—that is, it was enacted for a policy  Cont’l T.V., Inc. v.

In addition to the legislature’s goals and policies of policing anti-competitive behavior, the legislative doctrines that protect consumers were implemented for that very reason – to prevent practices “unfair” to consumers.Antitrust and Franchise Operations Manuals: Regulating and Remedying Violations As was the case for regulation of operations manuals, antitrust laws often require a balancing act. On one side is the consumer benefit analysis and the desire to avoid anti-competitive behavior. On the other end, various agencies have to be careful to not slow “legitimate, pro-competitive behavior.” While the behaviors may not look the same, it is the risk of being classified as anti-competitive that deters businesses from making aggressive decisions that could benefit consumers in the long run.An individual or business wronged by anti-competitive behavior is entitled to request injunctive relief.If a party seeks damages, the situation becomes more complicated. The applicable statute allows for any “reasonable system of estimating aggregate damages as the court . . . may permit.” This system creates a massive financial risk for any defendant and the situation is aggravated by the remedy of treble damages. In the franchising context, this could have a substantial impact. If a franchisor is found liable for an antitrust violation, treble monetary damages can put the franchisor in a dire situation. Recall that a franchisor is required to provide services to other franchisees, such as advertising, management training, and design. It has to keep investing in itself in order to remain an appealing franchise. When a franchisor has a civil liability award or judgment hanging over its head, the franchisor may not have enough capital to perform those functions. In such a scenario, the franchisor may be exposed to additional franchisee suits for not performing contractual duties. One poor calculation or judgment could effectively end the franchise entirely.

Furthermore, the FTC Franchise Rule requires the disclosure of pending litigation to the franchisee. Knowledge of this litigation can serve as a deterrent and prevent potential franchisees from signing franchise agreements. See 16 C.F.R. §§ 436.5(c)(1)(i)(A), (i)(B) (2018).  In contrast, perhaps the laws are too weak to deter franchisors’ anticompetitive behavior. The FTC Franchise Rule mainly requires a disclosure and does not necessarily regulate the behavior that occurs after the franchise agreement has been signed. This occurs when a franchisor terminates a franchise on a whim or when a franchisor authorizes a second franchise despite its negative effects on pre-existing franchises. As of now, franchisees must rely on common law and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It is extremely difficult to wage a war over “good faith,” and the damages are limited to compensatory or restitution damages. This creates little incentive for a franchisee to take on the risk and cost of litigation, especially given the low probability of success for most such claims. Indeed, the franchise contract, drafted by the franchisor, usually bolsters the franchisor’s defenses significantly.The sword of antitrust cuts both ways. Franchisors must concern themselves with vertical and horizontal restraints, price discrimination, and unfair trade practices. Unfair trade practice claims are usually grounded in state law and based on the Unfair Trade Practices Act (“UTPA”). Wronged individuals can make a claim by alleging that an act was unfair or deceptive. In Florida, part of enforcement depends on a plaintiff bringing suit, but if only a relatively small amount is involved in the potential recovery for the case, there might not be enough to even recover the franchisee’s legal fees. As such, potential plaintiffs might determine that the potential lawsuit is too costly and too much of a hassle. This causes individual  Cavanagh, supra note 321,at 631 (citing deterrence as a goal of treble damages). But see 16 C.F.R. § 436.9 (2018)(regulating conduct that may contradict initial disclosures after the agreement was signed).   Cavanagh, supra note 321. Unfortunately for the franchisee, most of the litigation over good faith and fair dealing ends in the franchisor’s favor. So, there is little unpredictability regarding outcome, but the actual path getting there varies from court to court. A study of 100 franchise contracts found that each of these provisions were found in over half of the contracts: advising the franchisee to obtain legal counsel about the contract (51%), and declaring that the franchisee had in fact obtained counsel, accounting assistance, and other professional support (58%); the franchisee’s admission that it had the opportunity to obtain clarification about any aspects of the proposed franchise (55%) and that it had conducted its own independent investigation of the merits of this particular franchise investment, for which no franchisor guarantees of profitability had been made (93%); the parties’ express recognition that there is no fiduciary relationship between the franchisor and its franchisees (83%).

Furthermore, the author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that over half of them – 270 – had clauses specifically stating that the franchisee waived any claims for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the express (quite pro-franchisor) terms of the franchise agreement negated any possible contrary terms under an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or that no covenant will imply any rights or duties inconsistent with a fair construction of the agreement’s provisions.

The UTPA’s purpose is to make consumers whole, and this goal is not served if attorney’s fees are not included.To determine that an act was unfair, courts use the FTC Cigarette Rule. The rule examines the following: (1) whether the practice \"offends public policy\" - as set forth in \"statutes, the common law, or otherwise\"; (2) \"whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; and (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).\" One example of an unfair practice is the theft of trade secrets. If a party alleges the theft of trade secrets, it becomes a misappropriation claim and follows the above analysis.Enter Civility Experts, this Article’s illustrative example for matters of intellectual property and antitrust. Civility’s only recourse was under the FTCA, which specifically proscribes any type of deceptive or unfair behavior that affects commerce. Unfortunately, Civility could not bring the claim itself but would have to wait for the FTC to take action.  C. Civility’s Remedies under the FTCA On the other hand, to protect franchisees, the FTC has established a Franchise Rule that is enforced under the FTCA. The rule requires franchisors to provide prospective franchisees documents containing specific information about the franchise, its officers, and other franchisees. In essence, it is a disclosure provision that protects potential franchisees from any adverse economic harm by alleviating information asymmetry issues in the franchise-transaction setting. If there is an alleged rule violation, the Commission can review the situation and prove or disprove knowledge of deceit by showing whether the defendant had actual knowledge of the material misrepresentations, was recklessly indifferent to the reality of such  Unfair Trade Practices Act, supra note 328 (stating the rule was adopted by the Connecticut Supreme Court).

The case is unclear due to the underdeveloped evidentiary record. Even if Civility could show that Molly Manners engaged in deceptive or fraudulent conduct, the FTCA remedy would still be difficult for Civility to obtain.It is more likely that Molly Manners would have to contend against the FTC in litigation, and as a result pay damages, but it is unlikely that Civility would find any type of monetary or injunctive remedy under these antitrust laws. Additionally, the FTC may seek “consumer redress” from Molly Manners, but it must provide that a reasonable person would have known that the conduct was dishonest or fraudulent.Conclusion In franchising, the best route for recourse against potential defendants who disclose confidential information—whether intentionally, negligently, or recklessly—is through trade secret law. The foundational policies behind trade secret law are clear – the protection of secret information for businesses that derive a material economic benefit from such information. Furthermore, the United States is party to international treaties that allow for the worldwide protection of trade secrets, like TRIPS. The framework for U.S. trade secret law mirrors these international commitments. However, trade secret law is not a perfect course of action because of vulnerabilities coming from independent creation. In contrast to trade secret law, the policies behind antitrust law are based on the idea that two or more businesses engaging in anti-competitive conduct, irrespective of efficiencies, could lead to detrimental effects for the national economy. Therefore, antitrust laws may be more effective in order for franchisees or franchisors to combat anti-competitive behavior between two others. For example, if Franchisor R and Franchisee E engage in anti-competitive conduct that jeopardizes Franchisee B’s business, B should be able to rely on antitrust laws for protection.  Circumstances should dictate whether a particular behavior violates trade secret law, antitrust law, both,  Fed. Trade Comm’n. v. Int’l Diamond Corp, No. C-82-0878, 1983 WL 1911, at *1 (N.D. Cal.

A franchisee that takes reasonable steps to protect the franchisor’s trade secrets and lacks the intent to violate trade secret laws should not be held liable if somehow, despite the franchisee’s following instructions, a trade secret accidentally gets out. On the other hand, if a franchisee fails to rise to this standard of honesty, fairness, and reasonableness, the franchisee should be held liable for a foreseeable consequence – the revelation of trade secrets.  Franchise relationships often are rather settled, and the traditional approach is to defer to the language of an agreement. Courts often defer to the operations manual or franchise agreement to settle most disputes. However, these agreements are not ironclad and foolproof. Courts must recognize, indeed play a part in, a changing legal landscape, with developments in particularly pertinent areas, such as trade secret law and antitrust law.  The operations manual has, or should have, some limitations in scope. Written contract terms and even lengthy, mutable operations manuals cannot cover every fact or issue. Case law and statutes can provide a path for resolution of disputes, giving franchisees the freedom to operate as they rightfully expected they could while providing franchisors the legal club to protect the franchise network’s business, including key property such as trade secrets. New federal trade secret laws, such as the DTSA, should help courts provide a uniform approach. In turn, there could be improved franchise planning and operations, with greater network efficiency and fairness. \n",
      "THE FAITHLESS FRANCHISOR: RETHINKING GOOD FAITH IN FRANCHISING Robert W. Emerson*  Abstract The rapid expansion of franchising requires that the courts, and the law in general, adapt to new circumstances, including the franchise parties’ rightful expectations. Franchisees and franchisors may not act in the spirit of the contract, and the traditional approach under contract damages law often fails to remedy that situation. For example, how can a franchisee or franchisor recover in the event of actions that are not prohibited by the contract, but that nevertheless run counter to a party’s natural (and probable) expectations? These and other issues are addressed in the context of a “Fairness in Franchising” rule. Currently, remedies for disgruntled parties to franchise agreements are limited to those available for the breach of an express contract provision, and they certainly do not allow for an award of punitive damages. However, legal remedies for bad faith in franchising agreements already exist. For example, at common law, tort damages may be awarded in a cause of action for “bad faith.” The allowance of a tort cause of action for bad faith could deter bad acts by parties inducing franchise purchases, by would-be fraudsters (whether franchisors or franchisees) throughout the course of a franchise relationship, and otherwise by free-riding franchisees or through the opportunistic behaviors on the part of franchisors after an agreement has been executed. A standard test for franchising good faith and fair dealing will leave courts better able to not simply deal with bad acts, but also to encourage the franchise parties’ appropriate and mutually beneficial actions while they are reaching and then implementing their contracts.

We see this when courts decide for or against claims that the franchisor should be held liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In Canada, too, one sees the same approach, and the search  Immanuel Kant’s philosophies also contained an interpretation of the Golden Rule.

See New Brunswick Act, section 3(1); PEI Act, section 3(1); Manitoba Act, section 3(2); and OC Act, section 3(1). Curiously, however, New Brunswick is the only Canadian for and possible application of a good faith covenant can be found worldwide. The covenant is frequently limited—in effect, avoided—  because courts cannot simply insert a “good faith” provision into a contract.Nonetheless, while the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing “cannot replace the express provisions of a franchise agreement, [it certainly] may shed light on the parties’ intentions when there is no express provision.” In effect, the covenant “may serve as the best method to measure contract performance in franchising.”Some courts have declined to infer a good faith and fair dealing requirement into franchise agreements. For example, in the recent decision of Pizza Inn, Inc. v. Clairday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the idea of strict compliance to the terms within a franchise-related option contract. The Court stated that, under Texas law, a franchise developer cannot invoke  equitable intervention as a means to province not to impose a duty of fair dealing. Richard R. Wozenilek, Canada, in NTERNATIONAL GENCY AND ISTRIBUTION CDN/47 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018). Although there is no uniform franchise legislation in Canada, the statutes in each of the provinces are substantially similar. Hanna & Koczerginski, supra, at CAN/2.  Good faith is applied to franchise contracts and the franchise relationship arising therefrom, in the two main legal traditions, the common law and the Civil Law.  [I]n civil law jurisdictions, the duty to act in good faith appears to imply a positive obligation to take affirmative steps to, inter alia, support franchisees throughout the franchise relationship and be responsive to threats faced by the franchise brand against competition. On the other hand, the common law duty of honest performance, which originates from a general organizing principle of good faith, seems to call for a negative obligation for franchisees to refrain from acting in a capricious manner towards franchisees, Perhaps more importantly, while the distinction between the application of the principle of good faith in these diverging legal traditions may not always be described as simply, it is generally accepted that the notion of good faith in civil law would impose more significant expectations and obligations on a franchisor, and likely sooner, than would similar concepts under common law.

Id. at 1066-1067. evade the plain terms of the agreement when the franchise developer attempted to exercise a renewal option.The franchisee had a twenty-year agreement with the franchisor for a Pizza Inn franchise. At the end of the twenty years, the franchisee had the option to renew for two five-year terms if the franchisee notified the franchisor of the franchisee’s intent to renew at least six months before the current term expired. When the first renewal term expired, the franchisor refused to grant the franchisee a second renewal because the franchisee had been two months late in notifying the franchisor of his intent to renew. Generally, in Texas, courts require strict compliance with option contracts.The franchisee tried to argue for equitable intervention to allow the franchisee to exercise the option to renew. Equitable intervention is an exception to strict compliance, which is allowed when 1) the delay is slight, 2) the optioner’s loss is small, and 3) failure to “grant relief would result in such hardship . . . as to make it unconscionable to enforce literally the condition precedent.” Equitable intervention has only been applied to lease agreements in the past. The franchisee had argued that not allowing him to renew his option contract would be a hardship because 1) the franchisee would partially forfeit the $1,250,000 initial investment to become an area developer, 2) there would be a forfeit of future profits, and 3) the franchise location would close. The court found that the reasons given by the franchisee did not meet the hardship prong because they did not lead to a forfeiture. The court reasoned that when the option expired the franchisee had received everything he had bargained for, that future profits were not an unconscionable hardship except for extreme cases, and that the franchise store closure was not an unconscionable hardship.The decision in Pizza Inn, Inc. v. Clairday overlooks the nature of the franchise relationship  and focuses exclusively on unconscionability as a reason to not apply strict compliance. However, why must equity be bound by (limited to) unconscionability? One could argue that, in applying the doctrine of unconscionability to the facts, a court should still account for the magnitude of harm and whether the parties acted in good faith.

The court also falls to recognize, for example, the potential answers to derive from concepts, provisions, or principles in the Uniform Commercial Code or the Second Restatement of Contracts.   renewal option in this case was not a naked option but was inextricably linked to the underlying franchise development agreement. Additionally, it is clear that the two agreements in Pizza Inn, Inc. v. Clairday (the development agreement and the renewal agreement/provision) should have been read together. Then, the court could have easily concluded that the developer suffered a forfeiture: The developer paid his initial $1,250,000 fee, which could be seen as including the discounted future value of the renewal options. If the optionee had paid this amount over time, not upfront as a fixed fee, would paying a much smaller amount – e.g.,  $200,000 one year before the expiration - have sufficed? Apparently, though, this was not an issue for the court, with its narrow view of matters involving franchising; the court’s turning toward good faith could have been a move towards justice. We will now consider tht further, as we examine the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.     The covenant itself is the expectation that the parties will adhere to “community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness” and refrain from interfering with the contractual rights of the other party or parties.Put another way, the covenant “prohibits actions that destroy, injure, or limit a party’s right or ability” to receive the expected benefits of the contract. As business deals unfold, uncertainty and complexity may reign, leaving any application of a broad-minded “Golden Rule” for franchise parties - extremely difficult as doing so requires the determination of community standards for a specific set of facts. Business lawsuits, for example, raise questions as to what “decency” is and at what point the parties are interfering with each other’s contractual rights. Thus, the term “good faith” has no precise meaning because it is subject to court interpretation on a case-by-case basis.Still, while the subject, good faith, may seem ephemeral, there are a number of principles and improvements that can be pursued. The Article first considers the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and how a party harmed by the covenant’s breach may need more than simply contract damages, which are insufficient to cover all the harms incurred. The following section, Part II of the Article, reviews special consumer or business relationships and the covenant, while Part III looks to franchising and the available damages for a breach of the covenant, usually just contract-related awards.

The Article then proceeds to major concerns such as fighting franchisee free-riding while also working to facilitate franchisee protections. It concludes with information about comparable franchisee protections abroad that may serve to model improvements in the U.S. law on good faith in franchising. Standards for good faith and fair dealing, with both prohibitions and perhaps safe harbors, may enable courts to foster appropriate conduct and to deter franchisor opportunism. NSUFFICIENCY OF ONTRACT AMAGES    In the event of a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the non-breaching party should receive contract damages. The purpose of damages is to assist the non-breaching party in recovering any financial losses or injuries that the party suffered because of the breach. The non-breaching party is normally entitled to (1) compensatory or liquidated damages, or (2) specific performance.    In the franchise context, an award of contract-related damages may be insufficient. In California, for instance, the amount of damages for a breach of the implied covenant in the employment context is limited to actual damages caused by the breach. Specific examples include the value of the loss of compensation and the benefits and financial damage that may result from a franchisee’s or a franchisor’s breach. More generally, it is the total loss in value, any incidental or consequential damages, and any cost or loss that the non-breaching party avoided by not having to perform.    Franchisees typically face severe challenges trying to prove damages that are “certain.” For example, in the event of a territorial encroachment how could a franchisee demonstrate that a loss of revenue stemmed specifically from the actions of its franchisor? Indeed, a franchise’s failure can result from cultural changes,  Restatement 2d of Contracts, § 205 (2nd 1981). OBERT MERSONUSINESS  166 (6th ed. 2015); Francis G.X.

See Robert W.

To show lost revenue, franchisees ordinarily must provide business records or expert testimony establishing a “reasonably accurate” amount. However, when a franchisee has yet to operate for a sufficient length of time, providing enough evidence to create a reasonable estimate of revenue losses may not be possible. Additionally, franchisees often can assert a quantifiable experience value to their franchise.          One issue, in particular, is the valuation of any goodwill the franchisee may have generated. Goodwill is the loyalty and reputation that a business has developed and which goes to the benefit of the franchise name and, more generally, the franchisor. There are no set ways to calculate goodwill, and the franchisor normally retains ownership of any goodwill through the franchise agreement itself. This poses an interesting question: If the franchisor breaches the franchise agreement, is the franchisee’s claim to any generated goodwill thereby strengthened?    The foreseeability requirement, insofar as it restricts the award of compensatory or consequential damages, may also present a high barrier for the injured franchisee to overcome. In this instance, the franchisee is required to show that the franchisor could have foreseen that the damages would occur because of the breach. Generally, predicting a breach of contract is difficult, even if one could foresee and thereby calculate the damages that would follow a said breach.       Lastly, the franchisee must mitigate any damages that arise after a breach occurred.

Id. obstacle because of franchise agreement terms. A franchisor may require that the franchisee return property or dispose of the property in a certain way. Additionally, there are certain investments that a franchisee makes for the purpose of a franchise agreement that the franchisee cannot use in any other context. Each of these hypothetical requirements may reduce the franchisee’s ability to recoup its investment.     Other forms of damages, such as liquidated damages or specific performance, are equally unlikely to be fruitful for an injured franchisee. This is because franchisees have notoriously inferior bargaining powerand will not likely be able to convince a franchisor to add a provision that provides for liquidated damages in the event the franchisor breached its obligations. Indeed, the franchisor may simply dictate the terms of the franchise agreement. This pro-franchisor power disparity emanates from law upholding franchisors’ contractual rights and from industry practice (a franchisor’s knowledge of the franchisee’s business) as well as the franchisee’s dependent state, along with economic and educational imbalances. Many franchisees do not even have legal counsel advising them about contract terms perhaps available to them, let alone negotiating on their behalf. Emerson, supra note 8, at 693 app. § C(9)(c) (review of 100 franchise contracts in 1993 and in 2013 showed that in 78% and 81%, respectively, terminated franchisees were required to return to the franchisor all trademarked supplies, signs, stationery, forms, and other materials; . at 694 app. § C(9)(d) (finding that 55% of surveyed franchise contracts provided that all franchisee concepts become the franchisor’s exclusive property, dramatically up from just 3% in 1993).  Contracting parties may specify in their agreement a specific amount due to the nonbreaching party if the other party breaches. These are known as stipulated damages or, more commonly, liquidated damages. Liquidated damagesLACKICTIONARY 473 (10th ed. 2014) (stating that liquidated damages constitute “[a]n amount contractually stipulated as a reasonable estimation of actual damages to be recovered by one party if the other party breaches”; further noting that a proper liquidated damages clause means that the fixed sum in the contract “is the measure of damages for a breach, whether it exceeds or falls short of the actual damages”).   The threshold to receive specific performance is high because courts tend to prefer monetary damages instead of forcing the defendant to perform a certain action. Some of the common reasons courts put forth for this preference are the high cost of monitoring a defendant and the desire to avoid involuntary servitude.

The current judicial approach - supportive of franchisor-dictated terms (even, for example, liquidated damages that only apply in favor of the franchisor) - only exacerbates the imbalance in bargaining power. On the other hand, since there are mechanisms for calculating a liquidated amount for a breach, franchisees should also be able to take advantage of a damages calculation method in order to determine their rightful award if the franchisor breaches the franchise agreement. With possible contract awards being insufficient for a harmed franchisee, the courts should provide a more expansive set of remedies.    A philosophical precept of robust, mutually reinforcing duties can be the basis for protecting franchisees and, in turn, strengthening the franchise relationship. Promoting system-wide uniformity nurtures sales.Franchisees are willing to pay for a franchisor’s market brand that brings to the franchisee customers who would otherwise not come to a non-brand business offering the same or similar fare. Franchisors charge for that brand, in terms of fees and royalties, while maintaining sufficient controls to maintain strong trademarks and to prevent franchisee free-riding.    PECIAL ONSUMER OR USINESS ELATIONSHIPS    The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is an implicit covenant that requires all involved parties to behave so that every party may fully benefit from the terms of an agreement. In more elaborate language, one American court ruled that “a person vested with contractual discretion must exercise that discretion reasonably and with proper motive, and may not do so arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner inconsistent with Supra note 50.  In a related area, there are proposals to calculate franchise royalties more efficiently and fairly. Robert W. Emerson & Charlie C. Carrington, Devising a Royalty Structure that Fairly Compensates a Franchisee for Its Contribution to Franchise Goodwill, 14 V(2020).

Any action contrary to this requirement is traditionally viewed as a breach of an implied contract.Courts have demonstrated a reluctance to expand the provided treatment and refuse to allow the implied covenant to supersede contractual provisions. Some take the stance that it cannot be used to insert contract terms that could have been obtained through negotiation. Despite its opposition, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be invaluable to protecting the franchisee from an arbitrary, callous, or even spiteful franchisor.    Enforcing laws to ensure good faith and fair dealings of franchisors is crucial to the health of a franchisee It is not prohibited for franchisors to deal in ways that best suit their business, but they are held to a certain standard to exhibit candor and engage in good faith when negotiating with a franchisee. Franchisors in the United States should understand that misrepresenting pertinent information in pre-contractual negotiations and even lack of certain details required by disclosures will serve serious consequences and will not be tolerated in franchise dealings. Honesty from a franchisor will not only build trust between itself and its franchisee but also likely facilitate the advancement of mutual interests.

Florida, for example, recognizes the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The covenant “is intended to protect the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties in light of their express agreement.” Good faith performance is important to uphold a franchisor’s legal obligation and encourage its future business, but a few states have allowed franchisors “sole discretion” to negate what was presumed to be a franchisor’s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Indeed, any use of discretion “should be consistent with the overall purpose of the agreement and not arbitrary, capricious or unduly surprising.”    Compensation in these disputes is normally limited to contract-related damages. However, there are some instances where contract damages for breach of implied covenants are insufficient. In these cases, franchisors  Mark Dady, Sole Discretion: So What?

This does run counter to the great latitude given for a franchisor’s “discretion” in overseeing the franchise system, as specified in the franchise agreements and disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs). The author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that the vast majority of them – 462 – had clauses specifically acknowledging the franchisor’s right to exercise broad discretion and that this alone would not breach an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

If the franchisor is able to exert unlimited discretion without any repercussions, the franchisee is at a disadvantage before the agreement even begins. This imbalance often occurs when franchisors execute the franchise agreement. For instance, if the franchise is nationally known and possesses a variety of franchisees, ranging from sophisticated to novice, the franchisor may fail to enforce the agreement equally among the franchisees.To counter the stark “sole discretion” franchisor defense, a franchisee would use the numerous cases, including those outside of franchise litigation, in which there is a narrow interpretation of this defense. Consider Miller v. HCP Trumpet Investments, LLCThe plaintiff, Christopher Miller, asserted that the defendant trustee board of a limited liability company (Trumpet), co-founded by Miller, violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Miller contended that the board had to conduct a Revlon-type or “open-market” sale process before selling the LLC under the covenant. Though the Miller court found Miller’s contention to be without merit, it held that “the mere vesting of ‘sole discretion’ did not relieve the Board of its obligation to use that discretion consistently with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”The franchise agreement does not lay out everything that is to occur during the franchise relationship. Franchisors and franchisees have expectations that may not be expressed in the written franchise agreement, expectations encompassed within an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Franchisees can have expectations about their relationship with their franchisors and expect certain things from their franchisors  Note, in the event of frivolous litigation, the attorney may be subject to punishment. MODEL ULES OF ONDUCT 1983). So while not a direct risk to the corporation, the attorney may have some objections against a frivolous action.  It is arguable that the franchisee is aware and accepts the disadvantage. After all, the franchise process involves discussions and plenty of disclosures.

(stating that inconsistent enforcement can lead to discrimination claims).  The Canadian approach to absolute discretion provides respite to the franchisee. The franchisor must act reasonably in exercising its discretion honestly and in good faith. Discretion must exercise discretion with a proper motive and not arbitrarily or capriciously. See Sally L.

Indeed, even the absence of a contractual prohibition on particular acts or omissions does not mean that one’s carrying out such acts or failing to act (omissions) necessarily falls short of evidence of bad faith. An act or omission may still be problematic – implicitly wrong while not expressly forbidden.  because of the special relationship that is the franchisee-franchisor relationship. When dealing with the implied covenant, the structural benefits that arise from the franchisee-franchisor relationship may warrant a more in-depth view of the expectations the franchisee has in the relationship. Benefits in the form of knowledge, experience, research, and reputation provide the base of the relationship, and monthly royalty payments make it last for the duration of the contract. Operational guidance in the form of research and training bolster the contractual relationship and place an onus on the franchisor to provide assistance to their franchisee. These structural benefits are enforced by contract but also comes with franchisee expectations for cooperation and support from the parent. It is not in either the franchisee’s or franchisor’s interests to slack on agreed contractual terms—especially given the special relationship that is formed which can give rise to a claim based on violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.EGAL EALISM    Similar to some employment and insurance contracts, what if it were possible for franchisees to recover tort damages? It would allow a party to escape statutory caps that may result in insufficient recovery.Franchisees should be able to recover if they are able to establish a special relationship or demonstrate that they have no other recourse in the marketplace. It would circumvent discretion-related defenses and allow the courts to uphold the purpose of the franchise agreement: a mutually beneficial and perhaps long-lasting relationship. This is an approach, referred to as the “legal realist” approach, that has developed in California.    Bolter v. Superior Court the California Court of Appeals held that an arbitration clause within a  The franchisee comes to expect and rely on the franchisor for comprehensive and ongoing training, marketing aids and advertisements, and other support services to further enhance the relationship.

For the franchisee, benefits arise out of a higher chance of success than in a sole proprietorship; shorter time to open; the selling power of a known brand; and the use of an established business model. See Eddy Goldberg, The Benefits of the Franchise ModelFranchising.com (last visited Dec. 30, 2020) (https://www.franchising.com/guides/benefits_of_the_franchise_model.html).   Notably, the success of a franchise system relies on a proven concept, the franchisor’s support and assistance, favorable market conditions, and a reputable brand developed by the franchisor. See Craig Tractenberg et al., The Franchisor’s Duty to Police the Franchise System, 36 FRANCHISE L.J. 87, 87 (2016).   This special relationship is symbiotic in nature. A franchisee that engages in free-riding subjects the franchise system to a possible loss of market share in the region and delivers inferior products or services to customers. The franchisor must ensure that the franchisee effectively represents the brand, as growth hinges on whether franchise stores faithfully represent the brand to the customer.

Legal realism is a populist idea of “contract interpretation principles that ‘give[s] judges explicit discretion over private transactions, freedom to do justice between the actual litigants before the court, and power to deter what the courts determine to be unfair market practices’ by inserting themselves into the contractual franchisor-franchisee relationship.” Id.  Bolter v. Superior Court,87 Cal. App. 4th 900 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001). franchise agreement was procedurally unconscionable because the franchisor had superior bargaining power, and the clause required the franchisee to arbitrate in Salt Lake City instead of California. The court used the legal realist doctrine of unconscionability to invalidate the franchise agreement’s arbitration clause as an unfair market practice. This case is a prime example of legal realist judicial techniques used to further populist goals, and correct economic and market power imbalances in franchising.Constructive discharge occurs when an employee discharges herself because of an employer’s treatment of the employee. In the United States, courts look towards the events that occurred around the time that the employee decided to discharge herself. In France, judges are not bound by the current classification of the employment relationship, such as employer-employee or franchisee-franchisor, when determining if there is an employment issue and how to classify the relationship, so a franchise arrangement can be reclassified as an employment contract to receive treatment under the constructive termination doctrine. In the United States, this idea is not prominent.Currently, there are no federal laws and only a few state laws that protect franchisees from retaliatory behavior from their franchisors. The idea of future legislation in this area is dim. The best hope that franchisees have for protection from retaliatory behavior from franchisors is from the legal community, courts, and regulators. In line with the information of a special relationship, in the independent contractor context, even if the relationship is not characterized as employee-employer, there still may be relief for an independent contractor in the case of retaliatory discharge. In Washington state, federal and state employment discrimination statutes apply to not only employees but also to non-employees such as those in an independent contractor-principal relationship. In Currier v. Northland Services, Inc., the Washington state Court of Appeals held that that status of the worker does not matter, and an independent contractor is also able to bring a claim for retaliatory discharge under the Washington Against  Scott & Snider, supra note 94, at 252.

Discrimination Act.Currier shows that employers cannot escape liability for employment discriminatory conduct because of the status of the employee as an independent contractor.Currier is not a franchising case, but it can apply to franchises. Sometimes franchisors terminate the franchise agreement in retaliation. Where normal employee-employer and employer-independent contractor relationships get the protection of anti-discrimination laws and retaliatory dismissal this can be applied to franchisor-franchisee relationships too. This can be especially helpful if a law or court decides that a franchisee is an independent contractor because the independent contractor relationship would not absolve the franchisor/employer of his contractual duties and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the termination context. Practically, where claims for retaliatory dismissal can be pointed to in a contractual employer-employee relationship, the presence of an independent contractor relationship does not absolve the employer (franchisor) of its contractual duties and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the termination context.  Occasionally, a court will observe that a franchisor-franchisee relationship has the attributes of a consumer relationship, with the franchisee (the consumer) subject to a contract of adhesion. The franchise agreements are fraught with bargaining inequality between the franchisor and franchisee, resulting in terms that reflect gross bargaining disparity. While it is a minority view that the franchisee is a consumer, several states enforce such claims under unfair trade practices statutes (Little FTC Acts) under which the franchisee has been found to be the consumer.Establishing a Special Relationship    To establish a special relationship or the no recourse requirements, it is important to distinguish franchisees from employees. Normally, franchisees are more aligned with independent contractor status. This is a vital distinction that usually eliminates the vicarious liability of the franchisor. Indeed, states frequently have created an exception to the implied covenant in the employment context. Franchisees face further trouble because, as independent contractors, they do not receive better treatment with respect to a good faith or fair See also Sambasivan v.

In fact, some jurisdictions bar tort recovery under the implied covenant and require plaintiffs to recover under retaliatory discharge.    The assertion of a claim for tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealings is rarely successful. One example of the many failures is Ennis v. H&R Block E. Tax Services There, the franchisee had worked with the franchisor for thirty years before the relationship ceased. The court noted that though, in effect, the fair dealing requirement is present in every contract, a tort claim is applicable only when a party violates its duty to act in good faith. The court further narrowed the tort claim by requiring a “special relationship” between the two parties. Despite the longstanding relationship and the fact that the “franchisor controls the sole means of [the franchisee’s] livelihood,” the court declined to grant tort damages to the franchisee. The court reasoned that to make such an award would unduly extend what constitutes a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.In denying to extend these “special relationships” to the context of a franchisor-franchisee relationship, the court opined “the most notable, but not exclusive, example [of such a special relationship] are contracts between insurers and insureds, where distinct elements are present, such as: unequal bargaining power, vulnerability, and trust among the parties; nonprofit motivations for contracting (e.g., peace of mind, security); and inadequacy of standard contract damages.” There are, of course, logical deficiencies in such reasoning: the court’s contrast of franchise relationships from the insurer-insured relationship reveals many similarities between the two. Like the insurer-insured relationship, the franchisor-franchisee relationship includes the “distinct elements” of unequal bargaining power, with the franchisor offering a “take it or leave it” franchise contract; vulnerability, as in Ennes where the franchisee depended on the franchisor for his livelihood; trust  Kropinak v. ARA Health Services, Inc., 33 P.3d 679, 682 (Ct. App. N.M. 2001). But see Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles, 416 P.3d 1, 11 (2018) (holding that a person is considered an employee unless “(A). . .the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact;  (B). . .the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business;  (C). . .the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.”) In effect, the potential that franchisees may not be considered independent remains strong, both on the facts in all states and on the law in the leading pro-“consumer” jurisdiction, California. Id. at 682. Certainly, constructive discharge, due to onerous franchisor requirements upon its franchisee or unmet obligations of the franchisor, may be an alternative remedy for mistreated franchisees. See Robert W. Emerson, Franchising Constructive Termination: Quirk, Quagmire or A French Solution?, 18 U.L. 163 (2015).  Ennes v. H&R Block E. Tax Servs., NO. 3:01CV-447-H, 2002 U.S. Dist.

While it may be frustrating to franchisees, the denial of tort related damages does serve a purpose. Awarding tort damages requires courts to balance two rightful interests - wronged franchisees deserving of compensation, and franchisors protecting their trademarks. By raising the prospects of a pro-franchisee damages award, a court awarding significant damages would encourage franchisors to act preemptively and minimize the impact of an unfavorable judgment. Potential actions—to protect themselves from both liabilities and pay for any awards—would include raising franchisee fees and restricting franchisee actions. In turn, franchisees would not be interested in paying higher fees and royalties to accommodate another franchisee’s recovery of extra damages.    Franchises are popular because, among other things, they facilitate individual ownership and operation of their own business. The imposition of further restrictions would make that dream harder to achieve. Still, the courts’ typical position, even when franchisee mistreatment is plain, is to focus on contractual limitations and not break precedent.Rare and Exceptional Cases of Special Relationships in a Tortious Breach     It was noted in Ennes that a tort damages award is appropriate only for “rare and exceptional cases” and gave only the example of the insurer-insured relationship, leaving open the possibility of including other ESTATEMENT ECOND OF ORTS 1979).

Ennes, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 419, at *12.   In an insurance contract there are two duties that are imposed involving good faith. Cheah You Sum, The Quagmire of Utmost Good Faith in Insurance LawUTURE OF ONTRACT  4.13 (Michael Furmston ed., 2020). The first duty is for “the proposer not to misrepresent any matter relating to the risk of the insured.” . The second duty is for “the proposer not to conceal facts which are material to the risk.” . These two duties are placed on the proposer because the proposer is in the best position to know of the potential risks and the insurer relies on the proposer for full disclosure. relationships by stating that the insurer-insured relationship was not the exclusive “special relationship” that would necessitate the availability of tort damages for breaches of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.The court further required more than the possibility that a franchisor could take unfair advantage of a franchisee. This stance falls in line with traditional jurisprudence. Courts are only interested in dealing with injuries-in-fact – ones that are concrete and particularized – and this begs the question of what is “rare and exceptional.” There is an argument to be made that a franchisor-franchisee relationship is a form of “insurance” in that a franchise pays, in the form of royalty fees and premiums, to run the business, receive guidance from the franchisor, and to use the franchisor’s trademarks. This argument can maybe establish a special relationship, or a special type of “insured” relationship, for a tort claim. This could make franchisees’ claims actionable because an independent tort claim based on breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be brought in court if there is a special relationship between the parties.One potential factor is franchisee inexperience. The franchise relationship in Ennes lasted for thirty years, and over time the franchisee likely became less dependent on his franchisor. An unsophisticated, comparatively new, and inexperienced franchisee presents a much stronger reason for courts to consider awarding tort damages. This is due to the reliance that inexperienced franchisees place upon the franchisor for business guidance: many franchise agreements require the franchisee to participate in ongoing training and routine compliance monitoring. This illustrates the trust inherent in a “special relationship”, which would necessitate awards in tort for breaches of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.     The concept of protecting unsophisticated parties, including franchisees, is longstanding. For example, unsophisticated franchisees often have more leeway to disregard, in effect, the impact of merger clauses.

The landlord decided to repave the parking lot six days before the tenant’s lease was to expire. This was a large cost that had not been included in the estimates for the year.The tenant objected to paying for the repaving because the tenant would not be using the parking lot after the lease expired. The Court ruled for the landlord because the contract stated that maintenance costs were allocated proportionally at the time the costs were incurred. This may seem extreme, especially when you consider that the tenant’s portion was around $89,000, but in this case, both parties were sophisticated and substantial business entities who were not without market power and knowledge.  While retention of an attorney may help the franchisee understand its situation and thereby presumably avoid the “unsophisticated” label, it is common for prospective franchisees not to employ or even try to have an initial consultation with attorneys. Some potential franchisees have turned to cheaper, online legal advice services such as Legal Zoom. A survey undertaken for this article demonstrates the concerns people have when looking to hire a franchise attorney, including factors other than money. Specifically, respondents, as prospective entrepreneurs, believed that the more experienced attorneys would already be representing the franchisor.

The reason might be the franchisor’s presumed ability to pay more. It could be that the franchisor is believed to simply have the experience and contacts to hire the very best lawyers.  Emerson, supra note 54.    Id. unclear how many unrepresented franchisees speak to legal advisors on occasion, but the number clearly is much smaller than it should be. The Federal Trade Commission also recognizes the need to distinguish the different levels of franchisee’s experience. For example, the level of disclosures the franchisor must provide to the franchisee varies depending on the franchisee’s level of experience. As discussed above, there are plenty of factors and considerations courts make to protect the inexperienced. With support from a variety of regulations and case law, the sophistication of a franchisee should be a vital consideration when determining the existence of a special relationship. Also, differentiating legal experience from business experience should be used to analyze the sophistication of the franchisee.Outside of the franchise context, it is also difficult to find these special relationships. An example of these special relationships may be government actors protected by a public duty doctrine. This doctrine limits a government actor’s duty to respond to situations where a special relationship is present between an individual and the actor, not to the public at large. This standard is in place because the government has a general duty to protect its citizens. However, to avoid undue dependence on such protection, courts require a special relationship, stemming from “induce[d] detrimental reliance,” to trigger a duty of care. This approach is very fact-specific, with no bright-line rule. However, the presence of a special relationship, as a legal conclusion, tends to depend upon whether there has been dependence among the parties, unilaterally or bilaterally.An Unorthodox Explanation of Franchisee Dependence    A franchise can serve as a unique relationship between each franchisee. For example, a franchisee may seek special provisions or notify the franchisor of special conditions that sets it apart from other franchisees.

N.Y. 1996) (stating “justifiable reliance” is an element of creating a special relationship).  The franchise agreement creates this form of privity. In the franchise agreement, the franchisor provides express assurances. The franchise agreement can discuss the term, area of protection, opening of the franchise, orientation and training, guidance, and more. Some assurances expressly or implicitly provided in the franchise agreement create a franchisee’s justifiable reliance on the franchisor. The agreement provides the royalty schedules, indemnification, contract interpretation, arbitration requirements, and more. These provisions seem to imply the existence of a “special relationship” subject to higher expectations of reliance on the franchise agreement. In fact, between half and two-thirds of all franchisees come from positions of dependent employment.    Consider a scenario where the franchisee sought specific assurances regarding territorial exclusivity. Due to the franchisee’s inexperience and unfamiliarity with common law doctrines such as parol evidence, the franchisee does not concern himself or herself with the fact that there are no provisions in the franchise agreement regarding exclusivity. Instead, the franchisee relies on the franchisor’s word. In this hypothetical, there is no fraudulent misrepresentation if the franchisor could have believed there would be no issue with encroachment. From another perspective, it may be almost impossible for the franchisee to prove any fraudulent behavior – any international misrepresentation - on the part of the franchisor. Moreover, could the franchisee establish his justifiable dependence on the franchisor?  Applying such law-based but practical concerns to the franchise context, courts should acknowledge the special relationship when the franchisor exerts a large amount of control over the franchisee. For example, when the franchisor issues a specific directive to the franchisee with regards to employment choices or another area normally under the banner of “day to day operations.” This level of control normally exposes a franchisor  Privity is defined as “the connection or relationship between two parties, each having a legally recognized interest in the same subject matter.” PrivityLACKICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).

It also creates a “special relationship” between the franchisor and franchisee through agency law because of the franchisors frequent control over its franchisees. This special relationship concept should be transferable to “good faith and fair dealing” claims and allow franchisees to obtain tort damages when relevant. Franchisees in Atypical Commercial Settings     The possibility of recovery is also limited to “special relationships” not covered under the banner of an ordinary commercial setting. These ordinary commercial settings typically involve two businesses contracting for goods, property, or services. This limited group tends to prohibit franchisees from using this claim to recover from franchisors they believe have acted in bad faith. However, it is arguable that franchises are not in an ordinary commercial setting, despite the support of this classification found in current case law.While franchises are relatively common in the modern economy, the method of their creation is not as simple as the start of other businesses or business relationships.      A franchise agreement can be considered a special type of business contract. In Postal Instant Press, Inc. v. Sue Sealy the court noted that while franchises fall under the realm of commercial contracts, they share many of the same attributes as consumer contracts. Specifically, there is an economic inequality between the franchisee and the franchisor that mirrors a consumer-producer relationship. Franchisees are often small business owners operating their first business. This results in an unequal distribution of both a  Cope, 290 P.3d at 320.

While states may enact legislation to protect the small business owner, creating a tort cause of action outside the scope of the franchise agreement will allow further protection.  Some state legislation tries to protect franchisees by treating them as if they were regular small businesses. For example, in California, courts construe the legislative intent of the statutory provision providing protection to small business owners as also protecting those who have entered into a franchise relationship. In Thueson v. U-Haul Int’l, Inc., the franchisee received the protections afforded to other small business owners when U-Haul terminated the dealership. U-Haul prevailed for different reasons, but the law clearly covered small businesses that owned franchises, as opposed to only covering completely separate, non-franchised, or networked small businesses. The franchise relationship deserves this protection because it often involves an unsophisticated and highly dependent party. The relationship is unusual, if not unique, from a combination of a franchisee likely being unsophisticated and extremely dependent on the franchisor to provide intellectual property and guidance. The guidance involves methods of operation, trade secrets, advertisement, and development techniques. Such a reliance on the franchisor’s word further distinguishes a franchise relationship from the ordinary commercial setting. The recognition of this lack of sophistication occurs in realms beyond franchise law. It was even the motivation for various regulations, such as the FTC-mandated disclosures, which  Century 21 Real Estate LLC v. All Professional Realty, Inc., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1217 (E.D.

Some states, most prominently California, have adopted tests that should lead regulators and courts to find many franchises constitute employment: commercial arrangements with the trappings of independent contracting between two business entities but whose hallmark is, in reality, employee-like franchisee dependency.  The California Supreme Court went against its previous ruling and adopted an ABC test to determine that a supposed independent contractor may in fact be an employee. The decision, in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles left many questions unanswered an outcome particularly vexing for some California businesses, including franchisors and franchisees. The state legislature moved to make the Dynamex decision statutory law, with some push from worker advocates and labor unions. The new law goes beyond the Dynamex decision by protecting even more people as employees than were covered under Dynamex In effect, California maintained its lead, and influence, in expanding worker protections to those previously viewed as distinct, typically unprotected independent hires. The state initially became one of the first to codify the ABC test into law, and a few years later, effective January 1, 2020, the California legislature  Lagarias & Kushell, supra note 168, at 6; Press Release, Federal Trade Commission, FTC Seeks Public Comment As Part of Its Review of the Franchise Rule (Feb. 13, 2019), https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-seeks-public-comment-part-its-review-franchise-rule Kelsey Basten, New “ABC” Test for Independent Contractors in California (May 22, 2018), https://www.govdocs.com/new-abc-test-for-independent-contractors-in-california/ (“The test presumes all workers are classified as employees unless the company can demonstrate all three ABC factors are met: 1.

Proponents of protecting independent contractors focus on higher-minimum wages and employer-provided insurance benefits, however, overlook the fact that a franchisee may be operating as a third party. There are times in which the franchisee is the employer and other times where the franchisee is dependent on the franchisor. This may call for a quasi-independent contractor status for the franchisee, affording protections in the proper contexts when necessary. For a discussion on quasi-independent employees, see Mitchell H. Rubenstein, Employees, Employers, and Quasi-Employers: An Analysis of Employees and Employers Who Operate in the Borderland Between an Employer and Employee Relationship, 14 U.L. 605, 606 (2012).   Andrew G. Malik, Worker Classification and the Gig-Economy, 69 RUTGERS U.L.. 1729, 1744 (2017). In Dynamex, the California Supreme Court set forth a new, stringent, three-factor test that is used in determining proper worker classification for purposes of California’s wage order rules. 416 P.3d 1 (Cal. 2018). With analysis rooted in the ABC test, the court held that the burden of proof is on the hirer, who is compelled to meet a very high bar because the worker is presumed to be an employee for California wage order purposes unless all three of the ABC factors exist. Id. enacted “AB-5,” which expands the scope of Dynamex Operations even further. The ongoing policy conflict over “independent” status and employment continues, now even via plebiscites.V. EXPANDING THE OOD AITH AND AIR EALING LAIM    Franchisee dependency is further emphasized because the franchisee’s actions are restricted until the franchisor gives approval. For example, a group of franchisees sued Dunkin’ Donuts for failing to respond to a fall in the Dunkin’ Donuts market share in Quebec, Canada. The franchisees worried that the franchisor would not revitalize the brand and strategy to compete against rising businesses. The franchisees were, in effect, trapped; they tried to adapt without having garnered franchisor approval, and they could have been in violation of franchise agreements. Instead of focusing on what the franchisees had a right to do, the opinion was about what the franchisees had a right to expect from the franchisor. The franchisor did not take into account the market developments: as a result, the franchisor was not innovating and passing on the innovation to the franchisees. The loss of market share incurred by the franchisees violated the essence of the franchise relational contract. The franchisees had a right to ongoing savoir-faire, but were denied such innovation. In effect, the decision permitted franchisees to take matters into their own hands.  While the situation occurred outside the United States’ borders, it still demonstrates an issue that United States-based franchisees can endure. The French concept of “savoir faire[,]” or know-how, was an element  416 P.3d 1 (Cal. 2018).  The California legislature codified the common law ABC test in AB-5 (CAA.B. No. 5 (2019), where workers are now considered to be employees who are “suffered or permitted to work” under wage orders unless the employer is able to establish the three factors of the ABC test. Recall that these factors are: (1) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact; (2) the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business; and (3) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.

Under AB-5, the ABC test was now to be uniformly applied across industries, as an attempt to streamline classification issues.  In a dramatic turn of events and through millions of dollars spent in lobbying, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 22, allowing gig-economy companies to continue treating drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22 greatly undermines California lawmakers efforts to regulate gig-economy companies, allowing companies such as Uber and Lyft to continue to classify their drivers as independent contractors with limited benefits.

In the Dunkin’ Donuts case, the Quebec Superior Court held that Dunkin’ Donuts was liable to its Quebec franchisees for breach of contract and allowed the franchisees to terminate their leases because of Dunkin’ Brands’ failure to protect its franchisees’ market share by maintaining the strength of their brand in Quebec in the face of “Tim Hortons onslaught.”    The French courts do not have a set definition of savoir-faire but draw from the EC Regulation on vertical agreements,the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR) norm, and the reflections of scholars. For something to be know-how it must have the characteristic of secrecy, substantially, experimentation and identification. There are many courts in different countries that recognize the idea of savoir-faire and have incorporated the idea into their jurisprudence. Franchisees are dependent on franchisors’ know-how, but, in the United States, franchisors are not required to transfer their know-how to their franchisees. France, on the other hand, requires the transfer of know-how in order for the franchisor’s Id.  Bertico Inc. v. Dunkin’ Brands Can. Ltd., 2012 CanLII 2809 (Can. Que. Super. Ct.), aff’d sub nom.

Instead of focusing on what the franchisees had a right to do, the opinion in effect was about what the franchisees had a right to expect from the franchisor. In Bertico, the franchisor was not taking account of market developments and was therefore not innovating and passing on the innovation to the franchisees; this violated the essence of the franchise relational contract. The franchisees had a right to this ongoing savoir-faire. One can conclude that Bertico implicitly gave permission for ignored, unaided franchisees to take matters into their own hands (e.g., foregoing the payment of royalties, suing the franchisee for damages, leaving the franchise network).  “Savoir” is a verb meaning “to know.” Laura K.

The amount of know-how a franchisor is willing to share with potential franchisees, to attract them, varies from company to company. A study of 100 franchises showed that 67% of the franchises polled had all training costs at franchisee’s expense and 94% would willingly continue to provide consulting services, after training is completed, for a fee.    Notice the similarities between the insurer-insured and franchisor-franchisee relationships. The insured is entirely dependent on the insurer performing its end of the bargain when there is a need for coverage. In the event the insurer fails to perform in good faith, the insured has little recourse other than through the insurer. The insured cannot seek other insurance companies for protection and an honoring of the policy. This is applicable to the franchise context as well. If the franchise agreement is not honored by the franchisor, the franchisee is not likely to be able to apply any of the equipment, inventory, or trade secrets to any other franchise. For example, a former McDonalds franchisee may not be able to use anything from his former franchise if he or she becomes a Burger King franchisee. Indeed, the ex-franchisee is typically barred for some time from any significant form of competition against the former franchisor. These non-compete clauses are common in franchise agreements of other countries as well and aim to protect the knowledge and goodwill of franchisors. These clauses often apply throughout the entire duration of the franchise agreement, not exclusively after the agreement has been terminated.    Another reason to expand the good faith and fair dealing claim is to allow franchisees to act in the event the contract is not yet created or has expired. Franchising is an expanding business model and, therefore, the  Emerson, supra note 147at 643; see also Odavia Bueno Diaz, FRANCHISING IN UROPEAN ONTRACT (2008)(indicating the importance of know-how being communicated at the beginning of the relationship and for the duration of the contract).

Franchise agreements may be stuffed with confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements, and other restrictive covenants that legally prevent the franchisee from moving forward in the market. The skills and training taught to the franchisee could be applied outside of that specific franchise, but the franchisee may have to change its location and industry or wait until the restrictions expire.

ROM/30 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018). cases of franchisor opportunism are growing in frequency. Almost all cases of franchisee abuse occur after the contract is signed – a time period that is likely to be outside the scope of any franchise negotiations. Since the abuse often lies outside of the terms of the agreement or the duration thereof, the franchisee may have to rely on tort law to seek recourse.     One example that requires the expansion of the implied covenant is when the franchisor opens a franchise near another franchisee. This “encroachment” issue is prevalent in the franchise context and is often considered the “number one problem” for franchisees. Unless the contract provides a regional clause, the franchisee cannot rely on the terms of the contract to protect himself or herself. Additionally, a novice or inexperienced franchisee may not even be aware that a franchisor has the authority to take such action. This exposes a major policy concern that the expansion of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing will address.     Consider encroachment. There are numerous examples, such as that of Steven Scheck, who entered a franchise agreement with Burger King. Scheck believed he had been wronged when the franchisor approved a franchise opening roughly two miles away from his franchise. Similarly, Joseph Davis, the franchise applicant that was approved by Burger King, was told prior to signing the franchise agreement, that the only other franchise “on the board” was located far enough to have no effect on his franchises. A third example involves Zuri Barnes, who claimed that he was completely unaware that the franchisor’s policy was to build “restaurants ‘wherever [it felt] there [was] a potential customer base to support the viability of all parties concerned[.]’” The cases involving Scheck and Barnes are not unique occurrences, and these type of lawsuits  Steinberg & Lecastre, supra note 179, at 106.

Davis relied on the fact that in 6 years, McDonalds had built only one restaurant in that area. Id. McDonald’s did provide in its Franchise Offering Circular that a franchise agreement does not inherently grant exclusivity in a region. Id. Unfortunately for Davis, four new restaurants were placed in the area. Id. One of Davis’s locations had a sales decline of around 45%. Id.  Barnes v. Burger King Corp., 932 F. Supp. 1420, 1423 (S.D. Fla. 1996). When Barnes originally signed the document, he believed that Burger King had a “2-mile policy” with respect to encroachment. It is interesting to note that Scheck had believed that the two-mile protection was violated. Scheck, 756 F. Supp. at 545 (“Plaintiff has stated that he suffered compensable damages caused by Burger King’s decision to sanction the . . . Burger King franchise two miles away from Scheck’s franchise . . . .”).  can send shockwaves through the franchise industry. However, both Davis and Barnes were experienced franchisees, and it is unclear why they assumed regional exclusivity would come with their franchise agreements.    Regardless of their own reasons, it is often quite reasonable for franchisees to believe that they will have some exclusivity or other protections involving costs, markets, or the like. A franchisee is told of this tried-and-true system for operating a business, and the franchisee is aware that franchisees reputedly have a higher success rate than people who open small, completely independent businesses without the benefit of a franchise network and usually sans the franchisee’s trademark protection and other advantages, including regional, national or even international recognition. Is it a crazy leap of faith for a franchisee to think that his or her franchisor would not authorize a direct competitor within a mile of its location? From the perspective of a consumer, both locations offer the same quality; so, why should one travel farther to one franchise location rather than the other? In these situations, owning your own business can quickly turn into a nightmare scenario of being trapped in a failing business.     Encroachment is not the only realm in which a franchisee may argue that there was a breach of the good faith and fair dealing covenant. There are a variety of operational claims involving “failure to provide training and support,” misuse of advertising funds, and poor-pricing claims. Also, a franchisor can breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to cooperate in the franchisee’s performance, doing something that injuries the franchisee in his or her right to receive the benefits of the franchise agreement, acting contrary to Franchisee Sues Burger King, UPI (May 5, 1994), https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/05/05/Franchisee-sues-Burger-King/2060768110400/ (noting the significance of the Barnes lawsuit).   One of the issues in dispute for Barnes’s lawsuit was that the franchisor intentionally failed to inform Barnes that the “2-mile policy” he believed was in effect was in fact false. Barnes, 932 F. Supp. at 1423 (“[T]here is some dispute as to whether the [franchisor’s sales and service manager] was specifically instructed not to [correct] Barnes.”).

The court in Wojcik v. InterArch, Inc. held that a franchisor could be held liable for breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the franchisor gives itself broad discretion over the franchisor’s performance and does not exercise good faith in the discretion. In Pennsylvania, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not implied in every contract as it is in the UCC. Judge Pratter dismissed the franchisee’s claim for breach of implied covenant in Azmi Takiedine v. 7-Eleven, Inc. because the franchisee had continued to operate his franchise.    In the United States, franchisors can be held accountable for a particular abuse of their power or more general wrongs. For the former, the U.S. District Court of Connecticut provided a good example by holding that a franchisor undermined its franchisees’ operations by selling products through supermarkets. As to more general “infractions,” almost any failure to provide the typical goods or services can be the basis for a claim against the franchisor. The franchisor’s training, support, and overall expertise, which are to be provided initially and on an ongoing basis to the franchisee, constitute one of the most important features of franchising, going to the heart of franchise economic viability as a going concern. The covenant of good faith and fair dealing has similarly found that franchisors breached the covenant by not providing such support,  Catherine Pastrikos Kelly, What You Should Know About The Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, ABA (July 26, 2016),https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/business-torts-unfair-competition/practice/2016/duty-of-good-faith-fair-dealing/.

J. 87, 87 (2016). even where the support was not contractually guaranteed.    Consider further that the franchisee is already extremely limited by his bargaining power and knowledge. As noted above, normally the franchisee is provided with a “take-it-or-leave-it” agreement and is unable to negotiate regional protection. In another scenario, the franchisee may not be aware such a problem exists. Many franchisees fail to hire, from the outset (or maybe even at all), the independent legal counsel they truly need before seriously contemplating and entering into a franchise agreement. Some individuals seek online help from websites such as “Legal Zoom” without even considering the possibility that the franchisor might place a competing franchise in close proximity. Thus, if the franchise agreement does not, for whatever reason, have a clause addressing the issue, a franchisee must rely on an award outside of the realm of contract law.      Another example of uncontracted terms is an implied term to take reasonable measures to help support the brand and the franchisees relying on it. The implied duty of ongoing support is recognized domestically and internationally, but what is expected is rather vague. There are some instances in which the franchisor may include a provision regarding ongoing support. However, when there is no discussion of the term, the implied covenant may be vital to assisting a wronged franchisee.      The final reason to divert from the original rule and allow for tort-based franchisee claims is to discourage franchisors from breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In the event the franchisor does breach the covenant or take actions similar thereto, the franchisee is limited in damages despite any willful or malicious actions the franchisor may have taken.

With respect to franchisors, the allowance of tort damages can be used as a weapon against free riding. Franchisees engaged in free riding can be viewed as breaching the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” A franchisee might free ride by lowering its cost and the quality of its goods or services.Franchisors can admonish against this behavior by threatening to bring tort damages. Tort damages, however, must be weighed against the appearance of immediate economic benefit to the franchisees who are free riding. A franchisee may decide to free ride because free-riding can allow it to keep charging the same prices as the other franchisees while lowering the quality of its products or services. The free-riding franchisee  This might serve as a counterweight to the highly restrictive parameters for “good faith and fair dealing” so often set forth in the franchise agreements and disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs).  The author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that over half of them – 270 – had clauses specifically stating that the franchisee waived any claims for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the express (quite pro-franchisor) terms of the franchise agreement negated any possible contrary terms under an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or that no covenant will imply any rights or duties inconsistent with a fair construction of the agreement’s provisions.

Enforcement of any proscription against free-riding may be limited to tort damages for breaching the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing” – in effect, for instance, reversing, with a damages award, a bad-faith termination by the franchisor.    Generally, free-riding by one franchisee weakens the potential power of the franchise group as a whole.In the long haul, this causes non-free-riders to experience a decrease in value and loss of profits. Franchisors may try to prevent free-riding by charging high fees upfront and regulating decision making. This strategy affects all franchisees, even potential franchisees that follow the standards. Instead of taking preventative measures, franchisors can rely on the tort-enhanced implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.     The question then becomes: When would a court find a breach of the implied covenant? One approach is to consider what behavior lacks good faith, based on an objective, case-by-case analysis. Referred to as the “excluder approach,” some common actions are “evasion of the spirit of the bargain, lack of diligence . . .,  “[T]he individual franchisee incurs only part of the reputational costs suffered by the franchise brand name due to her free-riding behavior.” Id. at 1183.

In a case-by-case approach, courts could also examine whether the franchisee has “recourse in the marketplace” or some other way to mitigate damages. A downside to this approach is that the boundaries of good faith are very ambiguous, which prevents a plaintiff or defendant from knowing what may trigger an “evasion of the spirit of the bargain.” However, a court may rely on guidance from insurance-related litigation, where a key public interest favoring tort recovery is to deter bad faith handling of insurance claims.    If courts intend to utilize the recourse factor, the focus should be on the “economic dilemma” that a wronged franchisee or franchisor may face. This factor would be more helpful in a franchisee claim because a franchisor naturally has more recourse than a franchisee. The franchisor can revoke the intellectual property licenses and move on to the next franchisee; a franchisee lacks that same luxury. Additionally, it is dangerous to end the analysis at that point because the dilemma (the lack of any real recourse) must have worse financial effects than a “normal breach.” Without deterring intervention, a faithless franchisor might have the opportunity to lie, cheat, scheme, and defraud without any possibility of repercussion in excess of where the franchisor would have been if not for the unethical practices: in effect, it allows franchisors to get away with what they can and pay after the fact for what they cannot. An award of tort damages, on the other hand, would markedly change the risk calculus for a franchisor considering such practices.      The reasonable expectations of the parties is another approach that policymakers may undertake. Just as important, it strikes a fair balance between two parties with different levels of bargaining power. California courts have considered this approach in the insurance context because of the power disparity between the two parties. Generally, the insured party signs what may be considered a contract of adhesion that  Diamond & Foss, supra note 214, at 591.  at 592. One may argue that “good cause” for termination, through court analysis over time, has actually become a clearer standard in terms of actual, collective judicial holdings. Emerson, supra note 27.

However, if the insured has legal sophistication or a closer level of bargaining power to the franchisor’s, the protection is not needed as much. A sophisticated or comparable franchisee will have a reasonable expectation that is closely aligned with, or at least cognizant of, the goals and behavior of the franchisor. Rightful franchisee expectations could be for successfully owning and operating the franchised business; earning a reasonable, hopefully optimal, return on that franchise investment; and buying into a prosperous system or brand. Franchisors should be expected to meet such expectations, if reasonable and not violative of any express contractual obligations. They may do so out of their own sense of fairness (of good faith and fair dealing) and because that is in keeping with not just the franchisee’s needs, but also the long-term interests of the franchised system as a whole.    The next issue to consider is the actual award of punitive damages. Punitive damages themselves are treated as a last resort when compensatory damages will not suffice. Normally, franchise litigation falls under the auspices of contract law, which typically does not award punitive damages. However, sometimes egregious actions in franchise law may result in a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Furthermore, the shocking conduct may be sufficient to carry the award of punitive damages.  One “guidepost” the Supreme Court considered when awarding punitive damages is how reprehensible the defendant’s conduct was (hereinafter, the “reprehensibility analysis”). Within that analysis, the Supreme Court mentioned three factors that are relevant in the franchisee’s situation. The first factor is whether the target of the defendant’s conduct was financially vulnerable. The second factor measures whether the defendant’s conduct involved repeated actions or isolated action. Lastly, courts should examine whether the plaintiff’s harm  AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 799 P.2d 1253, 1265 (Cal. 1990). id.

Id. at 419.  was the result of malice, trickery, or deceit.    The franchisee may be financially vulnerable during the beginning of the franchise relationship. However, the franchisee is undoubtedly bound financially to the franchisor throughout the duration of and perhaps beyond the franchise agreement. Franchisees rely on franchisors to provide business guidance and other assistance, such as the furnishing of training materials or goods. It is this provision that makes franchising so appealing to some would-be “entrepreneurs” who want to own and run a business, but also want a network, a valuable trademark, and advice – some institutional “handholding.” The strength of the franchise and the franchisor is a major determinant of the franchisee’s success. Therefore, the franchisee is financially vulnerable to the actions of the franchisor. Indeed, any actions that are outside the covenant of good faith and fair dealings can have a negative impact on either party.    Consider a situation in which the franchisor refuses to renew the franchise agreement and thereby affects a financially vulnerable franchisee. For some franchises, a franchisee will need to invest somewhere in the range of $300,000 to $600,000. With that being just the initial investment, the franchisee is also obligated to pay royalties and, perhaps, to order from specific manufacturers and vendors at the franchisor’s discretion. This may result in the franchisee paying a higher price than what it would pay from an alternative source. After all of these payments, the franchisee is no doubt duty bound and economically exposed to the franchisor. The franchisee may not see profit to make back that initial investment until two or three years after the business  Diane G.P. Flannery and Jason T.

María del Carmen Alvarado, Peru, inNTERNATIONAL RANCHISING PER/1, PER/11 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018).  Suing a franchisor for failure to renew without cause is a common occurrence. Franchisees are often frustrated when they are forced to terminate their businesses without a valid reason from the franchisor. For an example, see McDonald’s Corp. v. Markim, Inc., 306 N.W.2d 158 (Neb. 1981) (stating the franchisees operated the franchise 196 to 1980).

All of these considerations tie a franchisee to its franchisor and demonstrate the financial vulnerability that a court considers. A reprehensibility analysis may also be undertaken against a backdrop of franchise ethics. Codes of ethics, such as those from the International Franchise Association and the British Franchise Association, have, inter alia, the purpose of providing a baseline for handling franchise disputes. When a franchisor has its own personally-tailored franchise code of ethics, a court may use those ethical guidelines to set the boundaries of good faith and fair dealing. In the pursuit of fairness, while interpreting the ethics codes, a court should recognize the franchisee’s vulnerabilities, examine the traditional behavior between parties, and, if possible, determine the industry norms. Note, however, that franchise relationships can be unique, so the court should be wary when considering how a franchisor interacts with a variety of franchisees. Industry norms can be complicated as well because of the wide variety of franchise concepts.      Whether the franchisor repeats its conduct against the same plaintiff-franchisee is the second consideration. In other words, even if a franchisor committed the same breach of good faith against multiple and unrelated franchisees, the courts would restrict their focus on the conduct against that specific plaintiff. However, if a group of franchisees banded together, courts would be allowed to consider the repetition of actions across various franchise agreements, assuming that all franchisees are in business with the same franchisor. Furthermore, the financial benefit of “combining” the franchisees’ contentions would increase the odds of a franchisor’s being held accountable for its bad faith actions.    Collaboration by plaintiffs might be blocked by non-disclosure agreements prohibiting the discussion of trade secrets, proprietary information, or information that the franchisor deems to be confidential. This is an extremely broad umbrella, and the list may not be exhaustive, depending on the terms of the franchise  Ellis Davidson, The Average Time to Reach Profitability in a Start Up Company, Chron (July 24, 2017), https://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-time-reach-profitability-start-up-company-2318.html.

The disparity in bargaining power may allow the franchisor to prohibit discussions of franchising prices or other franchise-related information. Such a prohibition would make investigating a breach of good faith and fair dealing even more difficult and costly for the franchisees.     Lastly, the court must examine the subjective intent of the alleged wrongdoer. Has the franchisor or franchisee acted in the spirit of the franchise agreement? This should not be a cursory examination. To find a lack of malicious intent does not, alone, mean that the party acted in good faith. As noted in Harlow v. Fitzgerald “inquiry into subjective motivation . . . may entail broad-ranging discovery . . . .” With the burden of proof riding on the shoulders of the franchisee, any saved costs from grouping with other franchisees would simply be categorized anew for the intent investigation. The presence of nondisclosure agreements once again could pose challenges for discovering a franchisor’s wrongful, or at least lacking in good faith, intent.      Fraudulent disclosure can exist in a number of different ways, like when a franchisor does not disclose a fact that he or she is aware that the other party does not know, the fact could not be discovered by ordinary investigation, or the other party could not be reasonably expected to discover the fact, and if the other party had known the nondisclosed fact he or she would not have entered into the agreement.Protections AbroadThroughout the world, suits may be brought challenging the nondisclosure or inaccurate disclosure of relevant information. In Europe, for example, a franchisee may have a claim of action against a franchisor for damages from, or other remedies for, franchisor nondisclosure or incomplete disclosure. Some nations may adopt a high barrier to franchisee actions, such as that found in  Taiwan’s Principle for Handling Cases Relating  The Uniform Trade Secrets Act states that a trade secret is information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, etc. that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to others who could obtain economic value from learning the information and the holder of the trade secret is making some sort of effort to keep the information secret.

Taiwan requires disclosure by franchisors, but further provides that a franchisee’s claim based on nondisclosure must prove intentional malfeasance or nonfeasance.In April 2020, Saudi Arabia’s new franchise law took effect. The language of the new law is ambiguous when dealing with disclosure and registration violations. The law appears to offer two options to the franchisee in the case of a breach, either terminate or demand compensation. If there is a violation of the registration and disclosure provisions then Article 19 requires franchisors to compensate the franchisee for losses suffered because of the violation, but Article 19 prohibits the franchisee from terminating the franchise relationship. On the other hand, Article 17 allows a franchisee to terminate the franchise relationship if there is a material breach of the registration and disclosure obligation, but Article 17 does not allow for a franchisee to receive compensation for the breach.Finally, potential punitive damages may also motivate the franchisor to exhibit its best behavior. Franchisors are able to purchase insurance protecting against “defense costs and settlement.” However, only about 20% of franchisors carry franchise-litigation insurance.i. Good Faith Globally, many jurisdictions have taken approaches influenced by German and French interpretations of the duty of good faith on both parties. Saudi Arabia’s new law will require the franchisor to act in good faith and will apply to pre-existing agreements. Canada, for example, in addition to disclosure requirements placed on the franchisor, imposes on each party to the agreement a duty of good faith in dealing in performance and enforcement of the agreement. The remedy for a breach of the duty of fair dealing is the right to bring an  The Principle, published by Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, focus on harm to the public interest and – unlike Taiwan’s Civil Code, which focuses on harm to private interests – the Fair Trade Law demands that there be a “harmful effect on the franchise market order.” Wellington Liu, I-Chen Wu & David Lu, Taiwan, in INTERNATIONAL RANCHISE ALES supra note 294, at 475, 497.

Brad Hanna & Mitch Koczerginski, Canada, in NTERNATIONAL RANCHISING CAN/5 (Dennis Campbell ed., 2nd ed., 2019). action for damages. The case of Katotikidis v. Mr. Submarine Ltd.provides an example of bad faith in the context of the special relationship that is formed between franchisor and franchisee. The franchisor abandoned the franchisee when it was experiencing operation difficulties and violated a legal obligation to assist the franchisee. The court awarded punitive damages because the franchisor violated the duties of good faith and fair dealing and “betrayed the trust that symbolizes the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee.Further, in Canada, an entire agreement clause does not preclude a review to determine whether the parties have complied with the expectation of honesty in performance.Denmark has a similar approach, in which the parties in the franchise relationship are held to standards of “good practice” and concerns the initial stages of the franchise, the ongoing relationship, and the minimum terms of the franchise agreement. There are also obligations on the franchisor that they must have operated the business concept with at least one pilot store for a reasonable time before establishing the franchise system. Training the franchisee is required and continued commercial technical assistance given throughout the relationship. Taking from the French, Danish law also acknowledges that know-how is an important element of a business and encompasses the information and technology required for the franchisee to complete business or certain processes.    The English approach is unique in that there are no specific safeguards for franchisees that are not generally available to all persons entering commercial contracts. There is no general duty to act in good faith in contracts, but in Yam Send Pte, Ltd. v. Int’l Trade Corp., Ltd., the court acknowledged that while the duty of good faith is not implied in every commercial contract, elements may be implied in contracts involving long-term relationships between the parties who have made a substantial commitment. While this was not a franchise case, the court indicated that franchise agreements are “relational contracts” and that franchisors will  Katotikidis v. Mr. Submarine Ltd., [2002] O.J.

Further, if a franchisor has the power to make unilateral decisions, they must exercise that power honestly and in good faith for which the power was conferred. A franchisee, however, may have the remedy of the tort of negligence, if the court finds that the franchisor owed a duty of care to the prospective franchisee. Franchisors are likely to owe a prospective franchisee a duty of care when giving estimates of potential profits or turnover rates that may affect the franchisee. Inaccurate information may lead to the tort of negligent misstatement.Courts are divided on the issue of implying good faith into contracts. The law does not impose an implied duty of good faith in commercial contracts, but the Code of Ethics requires the franchisee and the franchisor to exercise fairness in their dealings with each other and to resolve complaints, grievances, and disputes with good faith.”The Carewatch Care Services Ltd v. Focus Caring Services Ltd. court dismissed a franchisee’s argument that there was an implied good faith requirement in the franchise agreement and held that the franchise agreement was detailed about the franchise relationship making it unnecessary to imply any additional terms into it. Other cases have gone the other way, though. In Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Saeed Bin Shakhboot Al Nehayan, the court held that parties to an oral joint venture agreement had to act in good faith towards the other party. Also, in Bates v Post Office, the court held that all “relational” contracts should apply a duty of good faith towards the parties. This case included guidance on what a “relational” contract is; indeed, under the guidance provided, a franchise agreement is included as a “relational” contract.Israel has an approach to good faith that is modeled greatly after the U.S. and Europe. The duty of good faith is imposed both in the negotiations for a franchise agreement and in the performance of the respective obligations of the parties.

The franchisor has a similar “know-how” requirement as seen in other countries, obligating them to provide the franchisee with business guidance and financial guidance.Italy imposes similar requirements on the franchisor as seen in France. The franchisor is bound to confer on the franchisee the know-how and confidential knowledge that comes from the franchisor’s own experience. A general description of know-how should be sufficient at the preliminary negotiation stage, and further details given in an operations manual. There are remedies outside of the contract if the franchisor is incorrect or false information was given to the prospective franchisee during negotiations. Portugal takes franchisee protections a step further, as there is no specific law applicable to franchise agreements, and applies general statutory regimes to impose the principle of good faith in franchise agreements.Franchisors have fought to replace good faith and fair dealing with a franchising Business Judgment Rule (“BJR”) protecting the party making decisions in the interest of the business entity (i.e., the franchisor acting for the franchise network). BJR could provide clarity and lessen litigation. In the corporate context, the law only requires that a party “acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” There is no requirement to act in the best interest of the contract, which is required by the good faith and fair dealing covenant. In fact, allowing a personally-interested decision may undermine the duty of care.BJR is not limited to the corporate context and the relationship between boards of directors and . at ISR/10. . at ISR/11.

For example, it can reach partnerships formed under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.Additionally, if applied in franchising cases, the fact-intensive nature of the rule would allow courts to perform, as in corporate BJR, a balancing test.    The umbrella of duty of care and loyalty is wide. Shifting BJR to the franchise context, the franchisor would substitute for the director and the franchise system for the corporation. BJR could allow the franchisor to protect its interests and sustain the franchise. Perhaps, the cynic may opine, the rule gives franchisors the ability to act in bad faith as long as the action can be hidden under the guise of BJR. Doubtless the franchisor may have legitimate reasons to take an action, but that decision may harm either a single franchisee or a more substantial number of franchisees. Generally, BJR could protect these decisions made by a franchisor and lead to a presumption that decisions were not made with abusive discretion. What about the franchisees? Do franchisees have a benefit or at least a way to overcome BJR?      Since BJR is merely a presumption, such as in corporate law, the presumption can be shifted. In the franchise context, shifting the presumption could occur when a franchisor makes a decision in bad faith or breaches a fiduciary duty. Some franchises have started to put BJR into the franchise agreement.Franchisees may find an argument when trying to prevent BJR from replacing the standard of good faith and fair dealing. BJR may be harder to apply in the franchise context because, if a franchisor makes a decision out of self-interest, which is quite common, then the rule cannot be applied. Decisions to switch brands, expand products, or re-locate may be self-interested decisions made by the franchisor without any clear benefit to the franchisee. All of these actions could lead to BJR being insurmountable. While inconvenient, such decisions may not necessarily be “bad faith, fraud, illegality, or gross overreaching.” So, a good faith and fair dealing standard may still stand in part because franchisors must act in good faith, no matter what standard is used.

Many courts review the franchisor’s decisions by applying the good faith and fair dealing standard. In Stone v. Ritter the Delaware Supreme Court stated, “to act in good faith alone does not establish an independent fiduciary duty that stands on the same footing as the duties of care and loyalty.” This breaks the chain between the covenant of good faith and fair dealing leading into a fiduciary duty and allows the application of BJR. In the franchise context, it has long been the standard that franchisors are not fiduciaries. This is in line with provisions specified in franchise agreements and disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs).However, the adoption of BJR could have some positive aspects as it would prevent ill-willed franchisees from taking action against a franchisor for simply acting to preserve the franchise network as a whole. If a franchisor takes advantage of such a provision and places it in the franchise agreement, the implied covenant will be blocked out.  ii. Fair Dealing In many jurisdictions around the world, franchise legislation has been enacted to impose a general obligation of fair dealing on performance and enforcement of franchise agreements. In Canada, the legislation sets out franchise disclosure laws that require fair dealings. To fulfill the duty of fair dealing, a franchisor must perform its contractual duties, and enforce the franchise agreement, all the while taking the franchisees’ interest into account. Before making a system-wide change, a franchisor needs to consider the entire franchise network’s interest, not only the individual franchisee’s interest, and the franchisor should conduct a “meaningful consultation” with the franchisees. According to the Canadian common law courts, a franchisor breaches the duty of fair dealing by unduly withholding information with the intent to make the franchisee not exercise the  Schnell & Gardner, supra note 303, at 180.   911 A.2d 362 (Del. 2006).

The author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that a large number of them – 325 – had clauses specifically declaring that the franchisor is not a fiduciary for the franchisee.

Also, the duty of fair dealing is breached when a franchisor unreasonably or abusively exercises its termination rights. Case law has provided guidance on the duty of fair dealing, but the law around this area is not set in stone. This duty does not override unequivocal contract terms, so the duty of fair dealing might be mitigated by franchise agreement provisions.The French approach to the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is a bit different than what is practiced in the United States. Specifically, in France, franchisor development schedules and business plans that do not live up to the “promise” can be grounds for liability. Because of the potential liability for franchisors and this special “expectation” claim, business plans should be avoided and left to the franchisee’s sole responsibility. The franchisor in France must be careful about ratios which are used to draft the franchisee’s business plan. These ratios are handed out to franchisees and if the franchisor validates or keeps silent regarding the resulting business plan, their liability is “practically certain.” The possibility of liability is implicated in an effort to preserve the interest of the franchisee in franchising.     The principle of good faith and fair dealing has not always been uniformly used in France, but recently, has been applied not only to the performance of the contract but also to pre-contractual negotiations and during the post-termination phase. In October 2016, French Civil Code was amended to include article 1.1.4, which states that “[a]ll contracts must be negotiated, created and performed in good faith. This obligation is a matter of public order.” The obligation of good faith can never be excused. In line with the know-how requirements of savoir-faire, franchisors are required—from formation to the termination of the contract—to Floriani, Carnevale & Nakhoul, supra note 4, at 8-9.  Id. at 9.   Although different jurisdictions have various interpretations of the duty of good faith, the French and German good faith standards have inspired many jurisdictions around the world, including Belgium, Austria, Poland, and Spain.

In order for pre-contractual bad faith to be actionable, other tort requirements must be fulfilled: the damage must have been caused by the bad act, the damage must be certain, and it must be yet uncompensated. This is based in the obligation to repair damage caused by one’s act or failure to act. See Nadia E. Nedzel, A Comparative Study of Good Faith, Fair Dealing, and Precontractual Liability, 12 TULANE ORUM 97, 115 (1998).   John Pratt, Common Law and Civil Law on Franchising Issues, Lexology 7 (May 2020). support the franchisee with commercial and technical assistance. Furthermore, a party that has acted in bad faith cannot require the performance of the other party.Australia is a common law jurisdiction, similar to the United States, in which principles followed by the courts of one state may be different than principles followed in another state. Generally, Australian franchises must comply with the Franchising Code and are subject to numerous legal requirements and require careful drafting of franchise agreements. The Franchising Code’s purpose is to assist franchisees in making informed decisions before entering into a franchise agreement and to provide a framework for a workable relationship between the parties. Civil penalties will be imposed for breaches of the Franchising Code, including lack of proper documents disclosed to prospective franchisees, not complying with the obligation to act in good faith, not updating financial disclosure documents, proper notice with respect to term arrangements, and copies of all material documents. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held, “the concept of good faith had to be accepted on the basis that it represented the current ‘expected standard’.” Exercise of discretion should be consistent with the overall purpose of the agreement and not contrary to the nature of the agreement.  When determining whether there was a breach of the duty of good faith, courts may consider whether the party acted honestly and not arbitrarily and whether the party cooperated to achieve the purpose of the agreement. Importantly, this does not prevent a party from acting in its legit commercial interests and does not require a franchisor to extend an agreement at the end of its term. The Franchising Code is stringent with requirements and the duties for both parties, including marketing requirements, financial information disclosures, leasing information, transfer restrictions, circumstances for termination, and dealing with former franchisees.Common law jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, and the United States, to one extent or another, have embraced a notion of good faith as an implied obligation in contracts—even though there is variation in the details and application.

On June 30, 2020, the Dutch Senate enacted a national Franchise Act, the first of its kind in the Netherlands. The Franchise Act became effective on January 1, 2021 and it regulates the sales of franchises while imposing a “good behavior” standard for franchisors and franchisees, requiring reasonableness in actions depending on the type of industry and the size of the franchise chain. There are specific provisions regarding prior consent and goodwill that franchisors opposed as restricting business and stifling innovation. These provisions are mandatory, and a franchise agreement cannot deviate from the requirements established in the Franchise Act, regardless of the law governing the franchise arrangement.The aim of the Dutch Franchise Act is to provide more balance in the franchisor-franchisee relationship by offering statutory protections to the franchisee. The parties should behave toward each other as a “good franchisor” and a “good franchisee.” The Act’s opponents questioned  whether such statutory protection is needed, as both the franchisor and the franchisee already had to behave in accordance with Civil Law principles of reasonableness and fairness. It is unclear how this will affect existing franchise relationships and how franchisors will react to this very pro-franchisee law, but it is a significant step toward codifying the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in all contracts.  ONCLUSION    Overall, most rules for franchising – statutes, regulations, and case law – tend to be franchisor-friendly.Franchisors can take risks without the fear that, ordinarily, courts will second-guess the decision and impose liability or sanctions for the franchisors’ actions.Given this predisposition in favor of the franchisor’s contract, as the franchisor intended it, the courts, regulators, or legislators could, and probably should, impose a duty of “faithfulness to an agreed common  Benjamin B.

See Emerson & Benoliel, supra note 123, at 105 (noting that all federal-level franchisee protection laws have been rejected and only a small number of states enacted general franchisee protection laws). By contrast, France’s laws are more franchisee-friendly. See Robert W. Emerson, Franchising Constructive Termination: Quirk, Quagmire or a French Solution?, 18 U.L. 163 (2015).  Selman, supra note 66, at 112.  purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party.” This or similar covenants of good faith and fair dealing are underutilized methods of recovery for franchisees. The hesitance is only reinforced by the courts’ hesitance to breach precedent and the difficulty of outlining the boundaries of what constitutes good faith. Courts are hesitant to rewrite contracts. Franchise agreements are not signed overnight and, regardless of the potential franchisee’s sophistication, a franchisee does have an opportunity to review the terms and accept, negotiate for changes, or even simply toss the draft agreement in the trash. The argument thus goes, should a franchisor be bound to presumably fairer (to franchisees) contract terms simply to make up for franchisees’ mistakes, often, at least at the outset, franchisees’ lack of due diligence when buying a franchise.Expansion of franchising requires the law, and the judges, to adapt to circumstances, to the age of disruption. While using the “blue pencil” may not necessarily be the answer, some sort of judicial quill should be used. Franchisees and franchisors may not act in the spirit of the contract, and the traditional contract damages may not be sufficient to remedy the situation. For example, how can a franchisee or franchisor recover in the event of actions that are not prohibited by the contract, but nevertheless harm either side of the agreement?      To move the franchise law towards more franchisee protections would be in line with some regulatory trends. This would also not be the first time in which policy overruled the freedom of contract. Consider the freedom of “master over employee” that was once held in the highest esteem. Courts and legislatures have determined that it is not an absolute right, and courts do have the ability to take policy considerations into account when dealing with contract enforcement.    In the modern era, protection of franchisees is likely to take a back seat to other issues. The last major economic substantive due process intervention occurred during a nationwide low point when the courts believed that protection of the overworked employee was a major policy concern. In contrast, franchising has been a rapidly growing sector of the economy and franchisees generally have a higher likelihood of success than their  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205 cmt. a (1981).

Note, it is unlikely for this change to occur at the federal level. When Lochner v. New York was decided, it signaled a rapid decline in federal intervention in the economy. This was known as the Lochner Era. See Barry Cushman, Teaching the Lochner Era, 62 SOUIS L.J. 537 (2018). As the Great Depression took its toll, the Supreme Court was more willing to intervene and this demonstrated a growth employment protection. However, in modern day, the Supreme Court has changed again and it is believed that another Lochner Era is quickly approaching.

In comparison, business franchises were rightly considered prone to danger—a wild, often lawless place until the 1970s, when California and other states enacted franchising legislation.    In the current legal environment, the optimal approach would be court adoption of a stronger, expanded implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It invokes an already-existing legal doctrine that can be applied to the franchise world with little disruption. It allows parties to be protected from issues not specifically covered in the contract. Franchisees and franchisors can take comfort in knowing that, if they are blindsided, they can recover. By adopting a standard test for franchising good faith and fair dealing, courts may be better able to delineate the boundaries of appropriate conduct and provide a stronger deterrent to bad faith behavior.

      "Monopoly Control by Government Ownership of a Franchisor David Emerson PhD 63 Crown Street Woolloomooloo 2011 Australia Telephone: +6147443358  Email :  davide@tpg.com.au Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 25-26, 2021 Monopoly Control by Government Ownership of a Franchisor Abstract This paper examines the capacity of franchising to control monopoly behaviour in the private sector, a question first asked in the 1950s but not apparently answered or examined further by government or academia. It is shown that franchising has the power to control prices and quality and that the franchisee does not have monopolistic opportunities. The results of a doctoral thesis on Dolomiti SuperSki, which examined the only known Community Franchise, is used to show how a government-owned franchise operates and the alignment of interests that it embodies. The differences between private and government ownership of a franchise is shown to have implications for franchisees and the general public. A government-owned franchise is more answerable to those within the geographic area of any jurisdiction and if the government owns the franchisor then its interests align with those of the market being served. This paper raises those original questions on monopoly control first asked last century and concludes that it is a question that could usefully receive some further attention.   Key words: (monopoly, franchising, Community Franchise) Monopoly Control by Government Ownership of a Franchisor Introduction In the middle of last century, it was speculated that franchising held some promise as a means for a Government to exercise control over abuses of monopoly power in open markets (Loeb and Magat, 1979, Demsetz, 1968). Apart from some attention in the cable TV market in the US (Hazlett, 1991, Williamson, 1976, Prager, 1990) where the treatment is focused on problems peculiar to that industry, there is little or no indication that this line of thought has been pursued for economic activity generally or even for government attention. However, it was an idea considered to be a prospective area of study at that time (Sharkey, 1979). In researching business models of public transport for my doctoral thesis, it became evident that this issue could be usefully reconsidered.  Monopolies occur where a dominant participant in a market achieves a position so powerful it can exploit pricing and its control of resource allocation to maximize its own shareholder’s value. A market suffering from control by a single dominant participant will not be able to resist moves by that dominant participant in adjusting prices, controlling suppliers and generally manipulating the market to force out competitors. This disrupts normal competition between separate commercial entities and benefits only the operators and shareholders of that monopoly company, frequently to the detriment of society (Kemp, 2015).   This paper examines questions of control of monopoly behaviour through the mechanism of a government-owned franchise. It reviews franchise structure, their history and operations. It then provides details of a community-owned franchise where the franchisor, owned on behalf of a geographically defined area or jurisdiction, maintains effective support and control over multiple privately-owned franchisees in the provision of ski lifting services in the Italian Dolomites. This regime is known from here on as a Community Franchise, which is the name used by Dolomiti SuperSki, the originators and controllers of this system. Seeing this unreported and unusual business model of public transport network of ski lifting was the stimulus to my doctoral study that resulted in a hypothetical application of this franchise regime to urban public transport ( (Emerson, 2020), Emerson et al., 2015). The Community Franchise regime is described and then analyzed for its capacity to control aspects of what is normally a service with monopoly tendencies (White, 2013, Evans, 1991). Those issues that are important to government and passengers are identified and the effects of the regime on these factors are analyzed before conclusions are drawn.  Franchise Structures Franchise regimes in the wider economy are generally private companies that seek the capital and operational expertise of others in the running and expansion of their businesses (Hoffman and Preble, 2004). It involves several essential elements (Minkler, 1992), namely; A product or service created and owned by the franchisor A license whereby third parties can supply the product or service to the purchasing public The need for franchisees to maintain the brand and all the standards for the product or service established by the franchisor The payment by the franchisor to the franchisee for the supply of the goods or service to the purchasing public in proportion to that which is on-sold to the public.  In a typical franchise, the product itself and all promotion of the product are undertaken by the franchisor, and the price for the product is totally controlled by the franchisor. The franchisee does not have responsibility for these vital aspects, and this significantly contrasts with other ways of conducting business.  In the case of normal commercial operations, each firm can set prices, product design etc. to their estimation of the market and each firm competes with the others within that market. Franchise regimes, on the other hand, provide some security to franchisees in the property rights associated with each franchise and for this protection and the existing business structure, franchisees are willing to accept and work within the controls of the franchisor.  In a sub-contracting arrangement, the sub-contracting firm has no responsibility for the performance of the product or service, it just supplies it and will be paid for the production of the item or service regardless of whether that is sold or not; the subcontractor has no responsibility to the contractor other than to provide the item or service as specified. A franchisee, on the other hand, is only paid for the achievement of the aims of the franchisor. If it cannot sell the service or product, it will not receive any recompense.  These are crucial distinctions as it puts responsibility onto the franchisee to achieve the aims of the franchisor in ways that are not part of a subcontractor’s normal considerations.  History of Monopoly Behavior A brief historical review shows that monopoly behaviour has been prevalent in many periods of history: monopolies have developed in many industries and through many periods of history.  It occurred with agricultural production and spice trades in ancient times (Frankopan, 2015), and memorably in the late 19 Century when the robber barons of the industrializing US economy seized the opportunity to dominate and control fast developing industries like steel, transport, newspapers, telegraph, etc. (Viscusi et al., 2005). The monopoly phenomenon seems able to emerge with nearly every change of technology or financial circumstance where early movers can gain advantages in a shifting economic and political landscape. Some would consider that emergent multinational giants of the tech era represent similar monopoly threats to society.  Frankopan notes that monopoly behaviour has always been a concern to both rulers and governments but for different reasons. Absolute rulers want to have control of certain activities to secure monopoly rents for the maintenance of their power. Nowadays, in democratic societies at least, governmental concern is more because the activities of sections of society that can gain monopoly rents have deleterious flow-on effects to the rest of the economy and society (Posner, 1978).  Size often confers efficiencies and competitive advantage and those companies that can become large and efficient often see off their commercial rivals and achieve dominance (Layton et al., 2011). Under the economic state of perfect competition, monopoly dominance means the monopolist gains the ability to raise prices, reduce quantity produced and exclude competitors through effective barriers to entry.  Some industries, because of their basic nature, are natural monopolies. Natural monopolies, potentially, will provide the cheapest production of goods and services and so, if they can be managed and controlled, there is some justification for their presence. Posner (1978) summarizes with the observation that:  “If the entire demand within a relevant market can be satisfied at the lowest cost by one firm rather than by two or more, the market is a natural monopoly, whatever the actual number of firms in it.” He goes on that in these cases, competition is not a viable regulatory mechanism for control as “it is either short-lived” or “it produces inefficient results”. The transport franchise Dolomiti SuperSki to be later considered in this paper, is in an industry that is sometimes considered to be a natural monopoly (Evans, 1991). This is in part because of the advantages conferred on passengers by common ticketing (a feature notable missing from say UK intercity trains) and integrated networks (White, 2013). But whether natural or not, it is the control of monopolies in a general sense that this paper is concerned with.   Control of Monopoly Behavior Many authors have examined the effective ways open to governments to ensure that no one participant in any industry can gain such a significant share of that market that it can engage in monopoly behaviour. Control of monopolies by the government is normally indicated in standard textbooks and research papers to be restricted to three general categories namely, having regulation of private firms, using the sub-contracting of tendered services, and using public enterprise (Viscusi et al., 2005, Hensher and Stanley, 2003).   In generally summary, Viscusi et al. (2005) record that the measures available to the government essentially boil down to three options, namely: having regulation of private firms,  using a subcontracting system of tendered services, and  the use of public enterprise  These three options are common to others commenting on the regulation of monopolies in public transport (Hensher et al., 2007), this last group looking at the structure of the contemporary public transport industry. One device currently used in transport, as well as the cable TV industry, is to allow a monopoly over a defined area, which is periodically tendered. In contrast, the device used in a Community Franchise is the ownership of individual lines by franchisees with full property rights, combined with competition, or the threat of competition being always present and with the ability of other franchisees to open lines in competition with existing ones.  Quality issues can also be problematic.  Spence (1975) argues that  “..market problems …. arise when a monopoly sets some aspect of product quality as well as price. It is argued that the market failure is associated with the inability of prices to convey information about the value attached to quality….” The most obvious need for regulation is to influence both the price and the quality of a product.  It is assumed that in a well-functioning market if those two elements are controlled then the quantity will adjust to suit demand. As well as the twin concerns of quality and price are the need for regulation to prevent concentrations of power in a single or a small number of commercial operators that can allow for abuses of oligopolistic and monopolistic positions. Lowering barriers to entry, by whatever means, is another and fundamental objective of monopoly control.   The three reported fundamental mechanisms for regulation of business monopoly are thus:   Avoidance of a concentration of power in a small group of companies, control of prices, and   the regulation of product with the specification of minimum standards  Any proper consideration of this topic must at least consider these three essential principles. If a government decides to not use a public enterprise, then control of monopoly involves both the prevention of exploitation and of ensuring that the monopolist operates at an efficient scale and at a lower price (Wolfstetter, 1996). Wolfstetter does not consider the use of a regulator acting as franchisor as a potential solution. However, that option was thought by several commentators to be a serious contender for inclusion by providing government control over monopoly activity while still allowing competition between different industry participants (Rubin, 1978, Williamson, 1976, Demsetz, 1968) and as noted was not an idea that has apparently been pursued.  So, how does franchising measure up on these issues? Franchising: Effects on Monopolies  The structure of the franchise regime gives it certain characteristics concerning the three considerations of monopoly control.    Exclusion of Competitors From the franchisor perspective, a benefit of the regime is the diversity of people and organizations that can contribute their knowledge, expertise and capital, to optimize brand effectiveness (Peterson and Dant, 1990). It is highly unlikely considering the benefits to the franchisor of a diversity of franchisees that a franchisor will end up with a monopoly within the ranks of its franchisees. In fact, the very opposite is more likely with a diversity of contributors being the natural inclination of the franchisor. This is an observable characteristic of franchising in any industry and an outcome that is not contradicted by the literature.  Control of Pricing  The very nature of the franchisor/franchisee relationship in traditional franchising, is to embed all authority over price with the franchisor. The operating franchisees running the individual businesses have no way of influencing the pricing to improve their own competitive position. This is certainly the case in terms of competition with other franchisees of the same brand: they are all selling the same product for the price regulated by the franchisor.  Maintenance of Quality  The franchisor defines the standards that franchisees must meet to continue to be able to continue as franchisees and be paid for their contribution. Franchisees can only sell the product that is being offered and promoted by the franchisor. Controls for standards vary as to the industry, but it is evident from the many examples of franchises currently in operation, that common standards can apply to all outlets of any particular brand, even if those outlets are owned and operated by separate individuals and businesses as franchisees in different administrative jurisdictions.  Community Franchise Regime  To illustrate the effect of the business regime on these issues of control, the case of a transport franchise as an example of a government owned business will now be described. This long-standing business that transports skiers in the ski fields of Italy was the subject of my doctoral thesis.  Dolomiti SuperSki has been in successful operation for over forty years. As a functioning example of this business regime, it not only shows how the regime operates over the longer term, but also shows the different alignments of interests compared to say centrally planned corporate ski field lifting systems and also, government provided public transport regimes. The ‘community’ in the name adopted by Dolomiti SuperSki is important, as it is government who must own and control the commercial franchisor for it to have this status. It operates differently to other franchises because of this ownership, and this will be discussed below.  Investigations over several years has established with reasonable certainty, that the Community Franchise regime is a unique operation for a public transport function that can now be analyzed for its effect on monopoly behavior.  This analysis will commence with ownership of the franchisor before moving to the allocation resources and the effects of these matters on the various interested parties.  Regime Operations The Community Franchise regime operating in the Dolomites works as follows. The (regional government) franchisor has responsibility for the marketing of the ski service, the encouragement of patronage by the public, the setting of operation times and standards and the collection and distribution of all income from fares. The franchisor does not undertake any transport function itself.  It sets fare levels, markets the product and collects the fares from passengers. It then distributes income to each private line operating franchisee, strictly in proportion to passenger numbers carried. The franchisor retains a percentage of the turnover to maintain its own operations and to ensure an appropriate financial margin for this activity.  In the Dolomites, independent private commercial franchisees propose, finance and then run all the separate lines of ski lifting devices, from chair lifts and gondolas to cable cars. Each separate lift, when it is accepted as a franchisee by Dolomiti SuperSki, is an independent business, although some franchisee operators own many lifts in several geographic areas. Each ski lift has electronic detection of an Opal/Oyster style ticket as a retained value charged card sold by the franchisor. It is carried by the skier and when detected at the ticket reading turnstile of the lift, that operator is paid, in real time, for each passenger who passes through. The franchisor uses its percentage of the retained fare turnover for its own administration, computer systems, profit, etc. and distributes the rest of fare income to franchisees.  This retained percentage is set at 3% of turnover; all other revenue goes to franchisees.  Initiation of a new line of transport does not rely on a central planning initiative like most public transport systems. Entrepreneurial, independent franchisees use their initiative to suggest, construct, improve and run in the most economic fashion, the lines of transport that the franchisee has decided are needed and would be financially viable. They do this knowing the standards relating to periods and times of operation, quality etc. Congestion is an indicator of demand and these private sector operators respond commercially to these indicators to personally benefit from an obvious need.  A noticeable effect of the independence of the franchisee lift owners is the large number of lifts and the continual improvement of the infrastructure, compared to integrated commercially controlled ski resorts. The Dolomiti ski fields are by far the largest by lift numbers (460), in the European market (next largest being Portes du Soleil in France 172) and by an order of magnitude compared to North American fields (largest is Vale at 45). This approach has also given the Dolomiti ski fields the largest number of lifts per length of ski runs in the world (Dolomiti lifts per kilometer of ski run: 0.335 lifts/kmrun c.f. rest of Europe 2.3 lifts/kmrun and North America 0.11 lifts/kmrun) (Emerson, 2020). It has done this whilst maintaining economical service delivery and providing productive employment of capital and labor in the local region that the franchise ownership represents.   The essential elements of monopoly control will now be examined to identify the essential differences in the way that the Community Franchise regime operates.  Pricing  Each franchisee, regardless of their size has security of tenure over their assets with the ability to operate without fear or threat of loss of those assets. If they operate within the parameters of the franchisor’s rules, only pricing by the franchisor determines if they will be able to continue their business.  The European ski market is large and competitive, including multiple fields in the alpine countries to which most of the population of the EU has easy access to and can choose between. The Dolomites is not considered an expensive ski destination but is listed in the best . The situation as to pricing establishes a responsibility on the franchisor to set fares and thus franchisee payments at levels that are enough to generate franchisee activity; without profitable franchisees, the franchisor will not have a viable presence in the market. It is also a safeguard against the abuse of pricing power and other commercial tactics by franchisees which could eliminate competitors and enable a franchisor to secure a more dominant position in the market.   The different effects of the regime on the allocation of resources was investigated in my thesis study by a computer game modelling public transport in an artificial city. This computer game was one that I devised specially for this study to investigate the different resource allocation models. This showed that social welfare was not significantly different in a regime where resources are allocated by a central authority, compared to one where all decisions on resource allocation are made by undirected competing individual franchisees and none are made by the central authority. This experiment also showed that competition between competing franchisees did not inhibit the evolution of a transport network that was in any way less efficient that one developed by a single authority by top down planning.  https://www.onthesnow.co.uk/news/a/582823/10-of-the-biggest-ski-areas-in-europeQuality Control  All ski lifting services in the Dolomites must operate over certain hours of the day and days of year, as determined by Dolomiti SuperSki. As well, the franchisees must adhere to standards of operation prescribed by government or other bodies with jurisdiction over these considerations, e.g. safety, engineering standards, etc. If an individual operating franchisee wishes to exceed these standards, e.g. by having greater comfort, longer operating times, enhanced visual appeal, better facilities at each end of their run, or whatever, it is entirely up to that individual franchisee. Provided the minimum standards are adhered to, payment for passengers will continue. If the franchisee can see commercial benefit in exceeding those standard expectations, e.g. by extending the period of the day in which it operates, or upgrading the facility to make it more attractive or quicker, it is possible for the franchisee to benefit from this application of their own initiative. This protects the service consumer by ensuring minimum standards but does not restrict, in fact positively encourages, any move for a better service. It allows differentiation of services by different providers who will benefit if their reading of the market for transport is accurate.  Barriers to Market Entry From the franchisor perspective, a benefit of the regime is the diversity of people and organizations that can contribute their knowledge, expertise and capital, to optimize brand effectiveness (Peterson and Dant, 1990). It is thus highly unlikely that a franchisor will be inclined to restrict the entry of the greatest range of franchisees that may result in there being insufficient independent entities to ensure competition. In fact, the very opposite is more likely; diversity of franchisees is an observable characteristic of franchising in any industry and an outcome that is not contradicted by the literature.  Franchisor Ownership  It is shown that franchising can provide control over the three essential aspects considered here as being required for monopoly control, i.e. quality, pricing and standards. However, the ownership of the franchisor itself can have a great influence over the way this power is exercised.  There are obvious differences between private and public owners, and this is illustrated by the case of Uber. The Uber phenomenon may not generally be referred to as a franchise, but it fits the definition in critical ways: the business model is such that the brand is that of the controlling company and it charges for the use of that brand by individual franchisees, which then commit their own capital to each franchise operation. The type of company structure utilized by Uber is considered to be a franchise by several commentators, (Giuli and Maselli, 2015, Schneider, 2015, Sundararajan, 2014). The franchisor, Uber, organizes the marketplace to bring provider and user together, and takes a percentage of the cash flow for doing this.   The basic function of Uber is essentially the same as in ski lifting in the Dolomites where Dolomiti SuperSki has created a marketplace to allow providers to freely choose the means of service provision and for passengers to freely choose to use any provider. In the process, both Uber and Dolomiti SuperSki handle all marketing, ticketing and the distribution of revenue to an agreed formula, retaining a set percentage of that turnover for its own administration and marketing function.  A principal difference in the Uber and Dolomit SuperSki regimes, apart from the fixed line nature of the ski lifting compared to the point to point flexibility of a taxi, is the ownership structure. Uber is a publicly listed joint stock company while Dolomiti SuperSki is a community owned private company. The difference in ownership and alignments of interest becomes apparent when the charges for franchisees are considered. Dolomiti SuperSki retains 3% of the gross cashflow for the maintenance of its function. This percentage of turnover contrasts with that of Uber which advises on the rideshare analysis company ‘Ridester’ website that it charges its independent drivers 25% of fare income. Ridester note that the actual percentage able to be retained by Uber can be higher, reportedly in the range of 27% to 50%, depending on circumstances. Uber is, of course, a very valuable listed company.  The case of Uber shows how a privately owned franchise can control crucial operations to benefit the commercial entity over both the passenger and the franchisee drivers, a feature identified by several researchers (Wilkins, 2016, Kosoff, 2014, Schneider, 2015).  On the other hand, a government entity is subject to the ultimate control of the legislature of the jurisdiction in which it operates. Although there are many examples of how slow these controls may be to take effect, the elected representatives of a controlling legislature tend to ultimately prevail. This was the case with say the East India Company, which was finally brought to heal by the British parliament after a century or so of deliberation (Dalrymple, 2019). Parliamentary scrutiny was more effectively applied in the case of Australia Post which was quite sensitive to the parliamentary scrutiny of its postal charges during the gradual decline of traditional postal services. This profit-making entity kept the loss-making traditional postal service going and sufficiently affordable to meet the parliament’s reading of the voting public’s attitude to what was popularly considered an essential service (Castro and Maddock, 1997).  It is an observable effect of local community ownership that the franchisor is very much more constrained in its ability to exploit the franchisees. This sensitivity to the legislature is in stark contrast to the behavior of Uber which has a long history of confrontation with governments in various parts of the world (Rauch and Schleicher, 2015).   Kemp (2015) notes how difficult it is to both define in legislation and to prosecute cases in courts over anticompetitive behavior. The business model of franchising invests all the power over pricing and quality in the franchisor. When this body is government owned, this authority over pricing is provided directly to a body that will use it with the oversight of elected representatives, a characteristic which tends to circumvent the difficulties of private corporate behavior.  Another consideration of ownership is the remote nature of company boards and shareholders. There is no necessary correlation between shareholder or the boards of company control and the areas that these companies may operate in. Accordingly, there is less incentive for a remote board to consider local community issues. Governments are essentially local to a specific geography in their operations, and a Community Franchise is responsive to the geographic area in ways that multi-national remote commercial entities are not. On consideration of these matters, it seems essential for the control of monopolies that the owner of the franchisor be by Government.  https://www.ridester.com/uber-fees/Resource Allocation and Monopolies An unexpected effect of franchising with implications for monopoly behavior emerged from my doctoral study. This was the techniques that the Italian regime has developed for the allocation of resources in the development of its transport network. In traditional integrated commercial firms, as it is for government and commercial enterprises generally, resources are allocated in a centralized manner by top down command. In the Dolomiti SuperSki case, all resources for the transport function are initiated and ultimately allocated by franchisees. Each entrepreneurial franchisee assesses both risks and the rewards for opportunities that it sees are open to it in new or improved services, before committing to and taking responsibility for asset allocation, funding and operations.  Network planning in this situation is a bottom up process, with the franchisor having no part in the process apart from the setting of the rates for the movement of a passenger over a standard distance. This mechanism, by either raising or lowering this amount, has been found sufficient for the franchisor to stimulate or suppress activity by franchisees. It has different rates for the carriage of passengers by different modes, e.g. by chair lift compared to say cable cars. By this means, it can encourage the interest of franchisees in investigating the viable development of different styles of transport.  The passengers are entirely oblivious of these differential payments, as the whole network is open to their use through their single ticket. This process has proven sufficient over the forty years of operation to have the world’s largest ski field by lift numbers develop into a network that is not noticeably different from one planned by the central owner of a ski field using the best planners available to them. It is planning that occurs without a central intelligent designer.  This bottom up process was shown in my thesis to be entirely consistent with appropriate definitions of design, so long as those definitions consider the three essential elements of design, namely generation of variation to an existing design, the evaluation of that variation by reference to a standard, and the selection of the alternative with the best fit to the criteria (Emerson, 2020).  In the Dolomites, the franchisor exerts control over the process, but variation is generated by franchisees, evaluation is by the travelling public and selection is by economic forces. This contrasts with the current operations of the government urban public transport enterprise in New South Wales’ where variation is generated by politicians and TfNSW, evaluation is by mathematical modelling and selection is by politicians advised by bureaucracy and expert consultants. These processes are in stark contrast to each other; the franchise is essentially market driven and the top down planning of the single owner is essentially centralized planning.   This manner of resource allocation eliminates in Community Franchising further potential conflict of interest in the centralized ownership of a monopoly; all substantive decisions of resources are made by those parties that are closest to and are most affected by the immediate financial effects of that allocation. In the Community Franchise regime, the executive function of the elected government is removed, along with all temptation to abuse the powers involved in resource allocation for party or personal electoral advantage. The essential function of the elected government in this situation is to reflect their constituent’s values by providing the necessary inducements to commercial franchisees to provide the services the government has responsibility for. The executive function in a Community Franchise is exercised by independent commercial entities, the franchisees, who respond to the rates on offer, but essentially are only interested in their own commercial judgement of the business opportunities, the rates on offer and the economic efficiency of the resource allocation. The level of inducement, i.e. the value placed on public transport in this case, becomes a politically contestable issue that is easily identified, debated and decided by electoral processes. The more difficult task of allocation and husbanding of resources is left to the commercial franchisee where more appropriate responsibility and risk management skills can be argued to reside.   Franchisees are well placed to shepherd resources in the most responsible ways: it is not up to a monopolist owner who may cross subsidize various costs or just maximize profits, or to politicians who may be swayed by political considerations.  This bottom up evolution is an effect that can be seen in many franchise regimes where the franchisor is open to the entrepreneurial talents of its franchisees. It contributes to the independent operation of regime participants free from the influence of a single monopolist.  Conclusions   Franchising as used in the Dolomites and, as proposed for an urban public transport application, provides effective control mechanisms to the franchisor over any market participant for prices and quality; franchising has this control built in.  The differences between government and private ownership demonstrate a vital factor in public interest. A government, if it owns the franchisor, can provide effective influence over the three important characteristics of monopoly concern, namely the inclusion of competing franchisees, the control of pricing and the upholding of quality standards. Ownership by government of commercial entities, from postal services (Australia Post) to railways (Australian Rail Track Corporation), are not uncommon. While there is no essential difference to these examples of government ownership of profit-oriented corporations and a profit-oriented franchise, there are differences in the behavior of those two contrasting commercial regimes.    A government owned franchising company, i.e. a Community Franchise, appears to have effective means of discharging its responsibilities to consumers and voters that these market constituents consider important. It would seem appropriate for the questions asked in the last century on the effect of franchising on monopoly control, to be restated and examined anew. It is quite conceivable that the franchise regime in government ownership can provide the control necessary to maintain public interests.  \n",

Many of these are consumer contracts or small business contracts. Some are presented as \"click-through\" agreements. That is, the standards form agreement is often a short decision between an offer and the delivery of a service. Most franchise agreements are standard form agreements. The franchisee does not have the ability to amend the franchise agreement as a standard form agreement. Indeed, it is the uniformity of the arrangements between franchisors and franchisees that characterises business format franchising. There is an issue with standard form agreements in that they often contain tests which are more usually characteristic of negotiated agreements. One of these tests is that of \"reasonableness\". Typically, the test is configured as a decision that would be taken by someone acting reasonably in simian circumstances. This article provides an overview of standard form agreements and the statutory context that contains them. By analysing the concept of reasonableness in standard form agreements and the \"reasonable person\" test, the article considers the Australian judicial interpretation of reasonableness in business format franchising. It concludes that it is unsatisfactory for franchisees to have to determine what amounts to reasonable conduct retrospectively and only after an issue or dispute arises. NTRODUCTION Contracts, made by reasonable people, are central to commerce. As David Slawson observed, as long ago as 1971, standard form agreements (SFA) comprised 99 per cent of all contracts. There is no reason to expect this weighting of negotiated contracts compared to SFAs has changed. Today, SFAs are ubiquitous, and non-negotiable. There is no getting around the fact that even significant events like committing to renting retail premises or a 10-year term as a franchisee are documented through standard form agreements. On any given day in 2021, an individual will use their mobile phone, swipe their pre-paid Opal, MyKi or Oyster card as they board public transport to get to work. They might download an app onto their phone via a clickwrap contract and be presented with a Boxtop after making an online purchase. They will be presented with targeted advertising while browsing online that has been made possible through real time bidding and browse wrap. The day may end by watching a TV series on ABC iView or Netflix, or going on a date organised through an app. Each of these activities, and countless others, are only possible for users who  Slawson, W. D. (1971). Standard form contracts and democratic control of lawmaking power. Harvard Law Review, 529-566. ISoF 2021 have agreed to the terms of SFAs with their transport provider, café, financial institution, employer, internet service provider or other supplier. SFAs are pervasive, inescapable and seldom read or fully understood as we rush through life. They also document relationships between franchisors and franchisees.  A fundamental tenet to be applied when interpreting contracts, including SFAs, is that they record agreements between reasonable people. The task of defining the reasonable person has been an important undertaking in the progression of modern contract law. We are told that ‘The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over apprehension and fromoverconfidence’.The reasonable person, also known as the man on the Clapham Omnibus,the ordinary prudent man of business, the officious bystander, and the reasonable jurorcameos more than 9,000 times in Australian statutes. That reasonable person is also both the franchisor who drafts the standard form franchise agreement, and the franchisee who is bound by its terms. In this article we try to understand, in the context of franchisors and franchisees: ‘Who are you Reasonable Person? I would very much like to meet you as we are so much alike - behaving the same …’This article will proceed as follows. First, an overview of standard form agreements is provided. Second, we identify the restraints designed to prevent the drafter of contractual agreements that meet the statutory tests from giving full reign to their own interests. Third, a discussion of the concept of reasonableness in standard form agreements is undertaken, with a specific focus on contextual reasonableness, perspectives of reasonableness, business common sense and the difference between reasonable and rational behaviour. We then examine varying definitions of the reasonable person that have emerged in particular legal contexts, with a focus on the Australian judicial interpretation of reasonableness in business format franchising before concluding.

ISoF 2021 STANDARDFORMAGREEMENTSSFAs offer a range of commercial benefits to parties, including franchisors in their role as drafters. Benefits include a reduction in drafting time and costs otherwise incurred in preparation of bespoke negotiated agreements. In situations like franchising they offer learning benefits whereby familiar terms are easier and quicker to work with for the franchisor-seller, the franchisor’s internal administrative team and their legal counsel. This leads to a reduction in institutional costs in processing each contract and decreased contractual complexity. The relative ease of replicating SFAs with minimal adaptation [for new parties] has also contributed to their success, and to them being criticised by Judges.We will return to the judicial criticism in Part VI.In addition to the drafter/supplier-driven appeal of SFAs, their widespread acceptance can be attributed to other economic and behavioural factors attributed to consumers. These include legal illiteracy, cognitive biases that include boundedly rational consumer behaviour, the high cost of legal advice, and the cost-benefit analysis consumers may undertake when weighing up the time it would take to become informed against the value of what they are buying.  But, countering all the benefits of SFAs, two of the central tenets of common law contract theory, the notion of ‘agreement’ and the concept of what it means to be ‘reasonable’, can be challenged. In 1939, American legal realist Karl Llewellyn suggested that: where bargaining is absent in fact, the conditions and clauses to be read into a bargain are not those which happen to be printed on the unread paper but are those which a sane man might reasonably expect to find on that paper.Around the same time, German-born American legal scholar Fredrich Kessler advocated that courts ought to take into account what they determine to be a consumer’s reasonable expectation in a business-to-consumer contract dispute, and to use the ‘typical life situation’ as a yardstick.One scholar goes as far as suggesting that because consumers of SFAs are unable to negotiate the terms of their agreement, no meaningful consent can be See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12.   Llewellyn, K. (1939) The standardization of commercial contracts in English and continental law, 52 Harvard Law Review, 700, 704.  Kessler, F. (1943). Contracts of Adhesion--Some Thoughts About Freedom of Contract. Columbia Law Review, 43(5), 629-642. ISoF 2021 asserted and therefore, the contract cannot be enforced. For American Larry DiMatteo, the absence of the intention to form a binding contractual relationship, writing:  A rational application of the reasonable person standard would recognize the flaw in this notion of consent. … at least one of the parties did not read or understand the fine print of the pre-printed form. There is no true manifestation of intent because there has been no conscious agreement to accept the unread terms.In recognition of this absence of meaningful consent, David Horton notes that ‘whether special rules should govern standard-form contracts has long been one of the most controversial issues in private law’. We will see in Part III that Australia has made moves in this direction, recognising that both domestic and business consumers should be given some protection from unnecessarily onus terms of SFAs. Malaysian academics Mohd Faiz Abdullah and Rozanah Ab Rahman go further than DiMatteo and oppose the labelling of SFAs as contracts.Instead, they suggest that SFAs are ultimatums, … with one party dictating the terms … on a take it or leave it basis. To Margaret Radin, ‘… contract law has slowly been stretched and manipulated to apply to a set of phenomena that are dubbed ‘contracts’, but no longer meet the bare-bones criteria’. The objective theory of contract assumes that there has been a meeting of the minds and that the parties have agreed to the terms and conditions set out in their agreement. Clearly not all scholars agree that this is what happens in SFAs. As traditional contact law does not address the characteristics of standard form contracting, such as the need for a meeting of the minds, how do we apply the established concept of the reasonable man in a world of one-sided contracts of adhesion and mass deployed boilerplate clauses? As Radin contends:  Under current cultural understandings, we cannot construe the ‘reasonable person’ in the position of the recipient of boilerplate in the way we formerly were able to construe the ‘reasonable person’ in the position of someone who intended to accept an offer DiMatteo, L.

Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 37(3), 505-533. ISoF 2021 Traditional theories of contract are arguably being contorted when attempts are made to apply legal rules that assess their valid formation to SFAs.  An aspect of reasonableness in SFAs that has not been addressed in detail in the academic literature is the act of a consumer choosing to remain uninformed, and whether this is reasonable or unreasonable behaviour. It is recognised that consumers are boundedly rational given that they do not consider many attributes of their purchase, choosing instead to focus on the salient attributes such as price, availability and physical characteristics. This enables sellers to supply low quality non-salient attributes. However, buyers also know it is not worth their time to become fully informed. Is it logical to expect a consumer to read a 25-page terms of use document before using their Opal Card? Or digesting the 5,000 words Google takes to explain its terms of service and privacy policy? The answer is ‘no’. Franchisees, as business consumers, may also be criticised for not reading every word of their franchise agreements. We identify some of the reasons for this in Part V. As pressing as the issue of whether the parties have agreed to the terms of the SFA is the fact that contract law operates on the dual assumptions that a reasonable person entered the contract and that they can be characterised objectively. All parties are impliedly reasonable people. But, what does that mean in practice? As Olivier Corten identifies:Any attempt to understand the use of the notion of reasonable in international legal discourse starts with recognition of a profound ambiguity, which is reflected in this quotation from a decision of the International Court of Justice: ‘what is reasonable and equitable in any given case must depend on its circumstances.’ The pervasiveness of the reasonable person construct is captured by Fletcher, who suggests that ‘[w]e cannot even begin to argue about most issues of responsibility and liability without first asking what a hypothetical reasonable person would do under the circumstances.’However, reasonable peoples’ circumstances vary greatly. By 2016, over 300 languages were spoken in Australian homes. One would have to assume that each demographic group would make different assumptions as to what and who is reasonable. Notions of ‘reasonable’ would be influenced by factors such as education level, where someone  Korobkin, R. (2003). Bounded rationality, standard form contracts, and unconscionability.

ISoF 2021 lived, their age, their mental state, and where they obtained information from. The expectations and identity of the reasonable person in multicultural markets can no longer be taken for granted as objectively knowable.That reasonable people are parties to SFAs is fundamental to the interpretation of contract terms. As Italian legal philosopher Silvia Zorzetto suggests, it would be reductive to consider the notion of reasonable as a concept that is simply an implicit component of statutory law. Reasonableness is a legal standard, a general principle and a word in a clause all at the same time. Zorzetto suggests that the concept is an inner feature of law and a criterion of legal validity for all laws. For criminal law American academic George P Fletcher, ‘[o]ne of the most striking particularities of our discourse is its pervasive reliance on the term reasonable’.British legal scholar Albert Kiralfy, an expert on Soviet and Russian law, argued that the authority of law ultimately rested on its reasonableness and not on its authorship.In an 86-page Australian franchise agreement ‘reasonabl*’ occurs 30 times, 90 times in the 303-page disclosure document provided by another franchisor. Those who draft and issue franchise agreements and franchisees signing these contracts have different interests. Radin notes that in the context of ‘less sophisticated parties [such as many franchisees], … [the text of SFAs] is often directed at deleting legal rights and remedies’. The integration of SFAs into all forms of consumer transactions facilitates the inclusion of one-sided or non-reciprocal rights. Let us now look at the steps that Australia’s legislature has taken to curb excessive opportunism by suppliers drafting SFAs. Some franchise agreements are captured while others exceed the current statutory thresholds. TATUTORY ESTRAINTS ON USTRALIAN A legal challenge may be made ex post where the terms are applied by the drafter in a blatantly unconscionable way, or where unfair contract terms are challenged by regulators. But, contracts may disincentivise legal challenges by, for example, expressly forbidding class actions, or through governing law and dispute clauses in franchise agreements which state Zorzetto, S.

For example, in My Amazing Athletes 2017 franchise agreement in the USA, Clause 16.7 “We each understand and specifically agree that any matters concerning the relationship between us and any dispute arising as a result, will be ISoF 2021 that, regardless of where in the world they arise, disputes may only, ultimately, be resolved in the courts of Connecticut. The absence of negotiation and meaningful consent has led to significant distortion in how contract theory is applied in practice. Therefore, the asymmetrical nature of terms in SFAs that favour franchisors is unsurprising.   The primary statutory instruments that can be called on to curtail over-reaching by parties drafting franchise agreements in Australia are the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which is Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (CCA), and the Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 2014 (the Code). Generic responses are found in the unconscionability (ss 20 – 22A) and unfair contract terms (ss 23 – 27) provisions of the ACL. These unfair contract terms provisions only apply to SFAs. Where contracts relate to financial products or services, Division 2, Subdivisions BA and C of the Australian Securities and Investments Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act) address, some unfair contract terms and unconscionable conduct. Unfair terms of small business contracts Section 23 of the ACL was amended in 2016 to extend to unfair contract terms (UCT) in small business contracts. This meant that franchise agreements that met all thresholds could ask a court to declare a term to be void. Prior to the amendment the ACCC conducted a review to gain a sense of the prevalence of UCT in contracts with small business. It included franchising, and found the following: The franchising sector was selected for the review due to the prevalence of standard form contracts in the sector, together with the fact that the franchising relationship is characterised by an inherent imbalance of power between franchisors and franchisees.  The ACCC requested that seven franchisors participate in the review. Three, including two major car brands, elected not to participate fully.  A variety of potentially unfair terms were raised with each of the traders, including the right to unilaterally vary operations manuals, unreasonable liquidated damages clauses, and terms that give the franchisor the right to terminate the agreement if the franchisee or manager is incapacitated.The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services 2018 identified UCT legislation as falling short for franchisees in several ways. It made determined on an individual basis and shall not be brought as a class action, or with multiple unrelated franchisees (whether as a result of attempted consolidation, joinder, or otherwise). This is prudent from a business standpoint because: (i) the mediation and arbitration procedures function most effectively on an individual case basis: (ii) there are significant factors present in each individual Franchisee’s situation which should be respected; and (iii) class-wide or multiple plaintiff disputes do not foster quick, amicable, and economic dispute resolutions.”  Timic v Hammock [2001] FCA 74 Subway Franchise Agreement, Australia, Clause 10 (f) Timic and Subway Systems agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in Connecticut any litigation or arbitration pursuant to the agreement (except intellectual property litigation or arbitration brought by Subway Systems against Timic).   https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/1117_Small%20Business%20Factsheet_FA4.pdf  ACCC, ‘Unfair terms in small business contracts: A review of selected industries’, November 2016, 17 ISoF 2021 recommendations about the application of UCT protections to the franchising sector in its report Fairness in Franchising. It recommended: prohibiting UCTs in all franchise agreements (recommendation 9.1 and 9.5);  applying civil pecuniary penalties and infringement notices where a standard form contract to a small business contains a UCT (recommendation 9.1);  resourcing the ACCC to investigate UCT reports by franchisees (recommendation 9.3); and  addressing the existence of UCTs in perpetual franchise agreements (recommendation 9.6). The unfair contract terms provisions were re-examined in 2018 and 2019. In its submission to Treasury in relation to UCT the ACCC expressed its frustration that despite significant efforts on its part it was impossible to force businesses using SFAs to delete UCTs unless the matter was taken to court. The ACCC identified that the protection offered to small businesses by the UCT provisions is undermined by fundamental limitations with the current regime, namely:  The current UCT provisions place a significant burden on the ACCC, or a party subject to a UCT, to enforce the provisions, while providing little to no incentive for businesses to proactively assess their standard form contracts for fairness. This is poor regulatory design, as it necessitates enforcement to achieve compliance with the law.As a result, compliance and enforcement action by regulators has minimal deterrence.Following extensive consultation Treasury announced in November 2020 that the notion of unfair contract terms would be expanded to enable consumers and small businesses to commit to contracts more confidently. The main reforms would do the following, but failed to address the ACCC’s frustration about its limited deterrence ability: Mak[e] unfair contract terms unlawful and giv[e] courts the power to impose a civil penalty Increase[e] eligibility for the protections by expanding the definition of small business and removing the requirement for a contract to be below a certain threshold Improv[e] clarity on when the protections apply, including on what is a ‘standard form contract.However, Section 23 ACL still contains thresholds, and the ACCC is still not empowered to impose penalties on parties that include UCT in contracts. The ACL currently states that:   (1)  A term of a consumer contract or small business contract is void if:                      (a)  the term is unfair; and                       (b)  the contract is a standard form contract.    (2)  The contract continues to bind the parties if it is capable of operating without the unfair term.    (4)  A contract is a small business contract if:  Review of Unfair Contract Term Protections for Small Business, ACCC Submission, 21 December 2018, 7.

(2)  In determining whether a term of a contract is unfair under subsection (1), a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:                       (a)  the extent to which the term is transparent;                       (b)  the contract as a whole.               (3)  A term is transparent if the term is:                       (a)  expressed in reasonably plain language; and                       (b)  legible; and                       (c)  presented clearly; and                       (d)  readily available to any party affected by the term.               (4)  For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a term of a contract is presumed not to be reasonably necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the term, unless that party proves otherwise.  25   Examples of unfair terms         Without limiting section 24, the following are examples of the kinds of terms of a consumer contract or small business contract that may be unfair:                       (a)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to avoid or limit performance of the contract;                       (b)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to terminate the contract;                       (c)  a term that penalises, or has the effect of penalising, one party (but not another party) for a breach or termination of the contract;                       (d)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to vary the terms of the contract;                       (e)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to renew or not renew the contract;                        (f)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party to vary the upfront price payable under the contract without the right of another party to terminate the contract;                       (g)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party unilaterally to vary the characteristics of the goods or services to be supplied, or the interest in land to be sold or granted, under the contract;                       (h)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party unilaterally to determine whether the contract has been breached or to interpret its meaning;                        (i)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, one party's vicarious liability for its agents;  ISoF 2021                       (j)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party to assign the contract to the detriment of another party without that other party's consent;                       (k)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, one party's right to sue another party;                        (l)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, the evidence one party can adduce in proceedings relating to the contract;                      (m)  a term that imposes, or has the effect of imposing, the evidential burden on one party in proceedings relating to the contract;                       (n)  a term of a kind, or a term that has an effect of a kind, prescribed by the regulations.  27   Standard form contracts (1)  If a party to a proceeding alleges that a contract is a standard form contract, it is presumed to be a standard form contract unless another party to the proceeding proves otherwise.   (2)  In determining whether a contract is a standard form contract, a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:                       (a)  whether one of the parties has all or most of the bargaining power relating to the transaction;                       (b)  whether the contract was prepared by one party before any discussion relating to the transaction occurred between the parties;                       (c)  whether another party was, in effect, required either to accept or reject the terms of the contract (other than the terms referred to in section 26(1)) in the form in which they were presented;                       (d)  whether another party was given an effective opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract that were not the terms referred to in section 26(1);                       (e)  whether the terms of the contract (other than the terms referred to in section 26(1)) take into account the specific characteristics of another party or the particular transaction;                        (f)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.  There is little evidence of the ACCC taking action against franchisors for UCT in their franchise agreements. One of the few examples is Back In Motion Physiotherapy which has a franchise network of 500 physiotherapists. Its standard form franchise agreement included an overly onerous restraint of trade clause. The matter was settled when: The ACCC … accepted a court-enforceable undertaking by Back In Motion Physiotherapy Pty Ltd to remove certain terms from its franchisees agreements which it admits may be unfair.However, there is a strong likelihood that unfair contract terms will be prohibited to a greater extent by legislation during the course of 2021. On 6 November 2020, Commonwealth and state and territory consumer affairs ministers agreed to strengthen the existing unfair contract term protections in the ACL. These reforms are also expected to remove the small business contract size threshold discussed above.

ISoF 2021 changes was issued for discussion in December 2020 with submissions closing in March 2021.Franchising Code of Conduct Compliance with the Code has been mandatory for franchisors since 1998. In it, parties are directed to a standard of ‘reasonable’ 14 times. For example, Clause 10 of the Coderequires that a franchisor not enter into a franchise agreement unless they have received written statements from the franchisee or prospective franchisee that they have received, read and had a reasonable opportunity to understand the disclosure document and the code, and have been given advice from an independent legal adviser, independent business adviser or an independent accountant.  The protective purpose of this requirement is obvious, yet it was not observed by Ultra Tune in relation to Mr Ahmed prior to accepting what Ultra Tune would for a time contend to be a non-refundable payment.Mr Ahmed’s evidence was that he felt intimidated by what Mr Tatsis told him during this discussion and the manner in which he spoke to him. Mr Ahmed said that Mr Tatsis sounded angry and condescending. Mr Ahmed described feeling very pressured. I have no doubt that he was accurately describing his state of mind at that time, and that it was reasonable for him to possess such a state of mind in all the circumstances.Other examples, in the Code can be found in Clause 15(3) to reasonable marketing fund administration costs, Clause 17 to a reasonable amount of time, Clause 25 to reasonable consent, Clause 26 to reasonable expenses and Clause 27 and 28 to reasonable notice. All impossible to calibrate objectivelyHE MEANING OF EASONABLE IN TANDARD FORM GREEMENTSRecognition that rigidity in legal rules makes it difficult for laws to be applied to evolving, and diverse situations has led to the inclusion of agile expressions, including reasonable Reasonableness is a subjective construct that sits alongside the other contractual standards of best endeavours, duty of care, due diligence, fairness, and good faith. ‘Reasonableness’ as a concept has been described by Australia’s former Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason as providing ‘a flexible but objective standard by which to fashion legal rules  Ibid.  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd - [2019] FCA 12, para 53. Ibid Para 216. Corten, O. (1999). The notion of ‘reasonable’ in international law: legal discourse, reason and contradictions. International & Comparative Law Quarterly, 48(3), 613-625. ISoF 2021 capable of application in a multitude of contexts’. In relation to contract law, ‘Mason also said that ‘at least in a commercial environment, community morality may well demand that expectations reasonably held should be protected’. The widespread use of reasonable, according to Belgian legal academic, Olivier Corten, is attributable to its diverse application:The notion of reasonable is also used at every stage of judicial reasoning: the determination of facts, qualification and interpretation of applicable rules, the use of various rhetorical and logical formulas. … the judge is called upon to play a significant role. In the Australian Law Reports alone there are 48 different references to ‘reason*’. It is used as an adverb and adjective, in phrases that include reasonable belief, reasonable endeavours, reasonably suspected, reasonable mistake, reasonable grounds, reasonable person and reasonable precautions. Deciding what or who was reasonable is necessary in many areas of the law; from tort, to contract , crime, discrimination, and more. Reasonable is a concept that can depend on context for some of its meaning. For example, usually in tort cases the concept of the reasonable person is understood as a sort of average – the reasonable person has average capacities and resources to take care. In a few cases the law endows the reasonable person with the resources and capacities of the defendant even if these were not average.The tort analysis does not hold true in contract. The dictionary describes a reasonable person as ‘a legal fiction, a personification of the unexceptionable and ordinary’. Reasonable has also been examined in the context of administrative law in relation to decisions made by owners of units in a body corporate. In Re Body Corporate for Viridian; Kjerulf Ainsworth & Ors v Martin Albrecht & Anor, Member Rooney QC concluded that:  [d]ifferent contexts for different notions of reasonableness arise, particularly those that reference whether for example a policy or decision is a reasonable one or whether there was a reasonable basis for particular conduct by a person. Similarly, where cases where there is a commercial interest held by a party but in whom there is a duty to act reasonably in the exercise of some discretion, such as whether to approve a transfer of an interest to some other party.    Clearly, identifying reasonable is not as simple as locating a single dictionary, judicial or statutory definition. According to Italian legal philosopher Silvia Zorzetto:   Geoffrey Davies, ‘Reasonableness’ in In The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia. (Oxford University Press, 2007).  Davies (n 44).

ISoF 2021 [R]easonable entails offering practical justification; in other words, reasonableness serves to justify human actions, choices, decisions, etc. From this point of view, it is a normative concept related to the practice of reasoning.An understanding of the nature of SFAs, with a focus on the complexity of fine print and the inclusion of pro drafting-party clauses, disclaimers, limitations on warranties, dispute resolution clauses, and other one-sided terms, will aid in defining today’s version of reasonableness. So, also, will an understanding of how the parties envisage the attributes of a reasonable person accepting a SFA. In Florencia Marotta-Wurgler’s study of SFAs, the average SFA in 2010 was drafted with increasingly more pro-seller terms and [was] several hundred words longer than its 2003 version. The increase in length was not caused by simplification and increased readability. Readability has remained constant, according to Marotta-Wurgler, with the average contract being as readable as a scientific journal article.The 2017 Australian Census identified that 66 percent of people aged 20 to 64 years have attained at least one non-school qualification. Of them, 62 percent have obtained a Certificate III trade qualification or higher and 31 percent have earned a university Bachelor degree qualification or higher. A similar proportion of males and females have obtained a Certificate III or higher (62 percent and 61 percent, respectively), while a greater proportion of females (35 percent) than males (28 percent) have attained a Bachelor degree or higher.It can thus be concluded that only a small proportion of the population, those who have completed a Bachelor’s degree, would be able to read the contents of a SFA, let alone understand it. Maybe this does not matter in the case of domestic consumer contracts where the consumer has recourse for defective products or services through statutory protections and Small Claims Tribunals. Horton asserts, simply thatbecause standard-form contracts are non-negotiable and consist of a maze of inscrutable fine print, a reasonable consumer would probably not spend time trying to decipher their terms’.Irrespective of whether SFAs ought to be considered contracts; the challenges of identifying the reasonable person have expanded with their pervasive use.

Flipping the Script: Contra Proferentem and Standard Form Contracts. U. Colo. L. Rev., 80, 431. ISoF 2021 wrote that ‘[t]he standardisation of contracts has removed the narrow focus of the reasonable person from the four corners of the contract’. To Marotta-Wurgler, boilerplate terms, as are seen in all contracts including SFAs, are modular and accretive. Legal jargon can be integrated into the fine print thereby making contracts harder to understand. Consumers may be told that specific terms, such as how to return a product for a refund, are on a website. This makes them inaccessible for people without reliable internet connections or a workable command of English. There are many other problems. As American legal academic Mark Patterson outlines:  [S]tandardization among firms also eliminates competition on the standardized terms, adding market power to bargaining power and making it even less likely that the needs of all parties will be served. When sellers agree on contract terms, they eliminate competition among themselves on those terms. Whether this elimination of competition leaves contracting parties worse off depends at least in part upon whether the standardized terms are important ones and upon whether sellers continue to compete on other, arguably more important terms like price.Kessler claims that SFAs ‘have become one of the many devices to build up and strengthen industrial empires’. If they were read, they would not necessarily be understood.The typical recipients of SFAs, according to Radin are not sophisticated parties. They lack understanding, power and control. In the context of franchise agreements, franchisees might be fluent in one field, like Angelo who is introduced in Part V, but neither they nor their suburban lawyer or accountant might be fluent in reading between the lines of a franchise agreement or a disclosure document. According to Marotta-Wurgler, the terms and conditions in SFAs remain unchanged because they are rarely invoked and are typically used for low-cost items that are unlikely to become the source of a litigation. But that justification that the goods being sold are low cost does not apply to SFAs that are used to purchase business format franchises. Marotta-Wurgler  Prosser, W. L. (1941).

These terms concerned the ability for the seller to collect users’ information and provisions enabling the seller to increase their control over the users of the good or service.Contract law cases considering the reasonable person have often concerned negotiated rather than standard form contracts. The concept of reasonable now seems to have two meanings in the context of contract law – having a ‘rational’ basis or being ‘appropriate’ in the circumstances. Both appear in cases where a ‘reasonable person’ is involved in the test for reasonableness but rationality does not always involve a ‘reasonable person’ test. We will now note the perspectives of circumstantial reasonableness, the perspective of reasonableness, business common sense and reasonableness as it relates to rationality before moving to look at the ‘reasonable person’ in the franchise context. Contextual reasonableness Larry DiMatteo suggests that the primary determinants of reasonableness are the circumstances surrounding the creation of the contract. Traditional judicial reasoning is not a scientific process, it is necessarily subjective. For Spanish European law researcher, Asier Garrido-Munoz, this is a justification for why certain factors, including principles, objectives and values, ought to be valued and given more weight than others. Medieval history professor Rebecca Colman adds: Since reason, like morals, can only be defined in relative terms, any judgment must be directed at the functional relationship between certain legal procedures and their particular social context.Other scholars have alluded to the vagueness of the term. Corten suggests that the concept excludes fixed, static and definitive interpretations. And Zorzetto acknowledges that ‘[w]hat is reasonable is not only determined by culture but is also deeply influenced by its  Marotta-Wurgler, F. (2012). Does Contract Disclosure Matter?

ISoF 2021 philosophical and political background.’ The inference is that reasonableness cannot be defined in the way that many other principles of objective contract law theory can be. It is therefore unsurprising that reasonableness has been criticised for increasing uncertainty in contractual relations. As Stefano Bertea outlines:   It is in fact quite common to see a trade-off between justice as reasonable fairness and as legal certainty. … certainty and reasonableness are colliding ideals or principles: 'to achieve a great degree of certainty within a legal system is to relinquish some of its reasonableness; conversely, a gain in reasonableness carries a loss in certainty'Further, it is often the case that what was reasonable at a point in time, is no longer reasonable at another.  In summary, reasonableness is distilled from the common-sense values of Judges, and thus from the values of the broader society at any given time. This is confirmed in the Australian case law that has addressed reasonableness in the context of negotiated contracts. Wegan Constructions v Wodonga the determination of reasonableness in the context of a ‘reasonable amount’ and the ‘reasonableness of a variation’ to a contract were central. The test of reasonableness was identified as ‘that of an objective assessment by an independent by-stander’, with Lush J stating that ‘[r]easonableness is not an abstract quality but one which is to be judged against the background of surrounding circumstances.We now touch on the distinction between ‘best’ and ‘reasonable’. ‘Reasonable endeavours’ cannot be construed to be an absolute or unconditional obligation, rather they are conditional on what is reasonable at the particular time, in the particular circumstances. Process Minerals v Consolidated Minerals addressed the distinction between ‘best endeavours’ and ‘reasonable endeavours’. There, Martin J stated that distinctions between ‘best endeavours’ and ‘reasonable endeavours’ raise ‘something of an arid terminology distinction’, further adding that ‘best endeavours’ is ‘hardly absolute in character’ and raises ‘reasonableness considerations about on the ground, day to day facts, which can only be assessed by reference to relevant circumstances as they subsist from time to time’.

ISoF 2021 Four years later, the determination of ‘reasonable endeavours’ was at the centre of another contractual dispute. In Woodside the High Court of Australia provided guidance on the interpretation of terms in a ‘commercial contract’, stating the they are to be determined by what ‘a reasonable businessperson would have understood those terms to mean’. Their Honours referred to CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company when acknowledging thatcontracts containing an obligation to use ‘reasonable endeavours to achieve a contractual object contain their own internal standard of what is reasonable, by some express reference relevant to the business interests of an obligee’. In this case, the ‘reasonable endeavours’ clause was held to mean that the sellers are not required to forego or sacrifice their own business interests when satisfying the standard. While neither of the contracts in WoodsideCPC Group was a SFA, the courts’ guidance suggests how they might decipher the qualities of the reasonable person. Reasonable from whose perspective?  Is the reasonable contract drafter thinking of ‘others’ or only the reasonable, or unreasonable, client? What is reasonable depends on which side of transaction one is located. As outlined by Blackburn J in Smith v Hughes ‘it is the view of a reasonable man in the position of the promisee which is crucial’ in establishing an estoppel. It has historically been argued that the reasonable man is possessed with the characteristics and abilities that enable him or her to evaluate, from a point of detached objectivity and from neither the position of the promisor or promisee. However, the vantage point proposed by John Spencer might be more accurate:  the reasonable eavesdropper is notionally at the keyhole, enthusiastically drawing inferences from what he hears within. But what if one of the parties is at Land’s End and the other at Llandudno? At whose keyhole is the reasonable eavesdropper notionally listening then. ... The difficulty is that the inference he will draw will depend on how much he knows, and what he will know will often depend on where he isThe question of what makes a provision in a SFA reasonable or unreasonable is difficult, if not impossible, to answer in a standard-setting way. There are many things to consider in any such attempt, including the perspective of reasonableness and how it differs for the drafting versus the non-drafting party.

In the context of consumer agreements, the standard of the reasonable person is generally considered from the perspective of the consumer. In Australian cases concerning negotiated contracts, we have seen the standard of reasonableness judged from the perspective of the drafter, the non-drafter and, most popularly, an objective third party.Gerard McMeel and Hans Christoph Grigoleit discuss objectivity in contract interpretation, offering alternative perspectives; promisee objectivity and detached objectivity:  ‘Promisee objectivity’ construes the language of the promisor from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the promisee. ‘Detached objectivity’ or ‘fly on the wall objectivity’ adopts the perspective of a reasonable bystander [such as the test in Hospital Products v US Surgical Corp (1984) 156 CLR 41], or eavesdropper on the parties. Whilst there are authorities supporting both formulations, it appears that the tenor of the most recent authorities is for ‘detached objectivity’ or ‘fly on the wall objectivity.Peters Ice Cream v Todd a restraint of trade clause was held by Little J to be valid only if it was reasonable in the interests of the parties, while at the same time ‘in no way injurious to the public’. In this case, the perspective was that of the drafting party. The reasonableness of the restraint was also to be determined at the date the contract was made. In this case, there was no standard against which reasonableness could be measured and, therefore, the court held that the restraint of trade clause was void for uncertainty. The drafter had not defined the scope of the restraint. In some cases, what is reasonable from the consumer’s perspective prevails. InTransfield v Arlo it was acknowledged that ‘best endeavours’ connotes ‘the standard of reasonableness’. The outcome of this case, where Transfield, as licensee, was defending an allegation that it had breached the competition law, was determined from the perspective of the non-drafting party. In presenting his judgment, Mason J focused on reasonableness considering the surrounding circumstances, as measured with regard to ‘the nature, capacity, qualifications  See for example Peters Ice Cream (Vic) v Todd [1961] VR 485  See for example Transfield Pty Ltd v Arlo International Ltd (1980) 144 CLR  See for example Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64; Morpath Pty Ltd v ACT Youth Accommodation Group Inc [1987] FCR 325; Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1969) 119 CLR 365  McMeel, G., & Grigoleit, H.

Adding that ‘best endeavours’ was ‘to do all that could reasonably be expected of it having regard to the circumstances of its business operations’. The US Restatement (Second) of Contracts (‘Second Restatement’, ‘The Restatement Test’) provides an interesting, yet controversial, approach. While there are criticisms of the Restatement Test, the trend for courts in determining procedural unconscionability has been to consider a reasonable buyers surprise with the content of the term. The Restatement Test essentially relies on the reasoning that the more unfavourable a term is in an SFA, the more likely it is that the [weaker/ consumer] signatory did not agree to it or understand it. Russell Korobkin observes that in doing so:  [C]ourts seem to have attempted to split the difference between the moral hazard problem (which would arise if buyers’ ignorance were permitted to work to their advantage) and the lemons problem (which would arise if sellers could enforce terms unknown to buyers) by excusing buyers for their ignorance only when terms are not featured prominently on pre-printed forms.A more recent decision by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia has clarified statutory unconscionability in Australia. The Court decided that unconscionability does not require the offender to take advantage of, or exploit, a vulnerability, disability or disadvantage of the victim. This is particularly important in the context of franchising, where the decision (which may still be challenged in the future in the High Court of Australia) would tend to favour franchisees in disputes over whether unconscionable conduct had occurred. That is, the test for statutory unconscionability remains related to the equitable test. Broadly, it is an action that could not be done in good conscience.It appears that the most popular viewpoint for ascertaining a standard of reasonableness is that of an objective third party, the person Spencer described as looking through the keyhole. Hospital Products v US Surgical Corp the court looked at an ‘intelligent bystander ... in the situation of the parties’ to understand ‘what is to be taken as the intention which reasonable persons would have had if placed in the situation of the parties’. In doing so they further acknowledged that the qualification of reasonableness is ‘usually associated with a best efforts Korobkin, R. (2003).

In Morpath the court (Fisher, Davies, Neaves, Beaumont and Miles JJ) had to determine a standard for the ‘reasonable user’ in the context of a request to reinterpret an restrictive covenant on land. It held that it means any purpose for which a reasonable neighbour might reasonably use his land after taking into account all the circumstances and the existing character of the neighbourhood and the extent to which the use may interfere with the adjoining owners' comfortable enjoyment of their properties or reduce the value of those properties. Beaumont J, quoting Windeyer J in Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation acknowledged that ‘[R]easonableness is a concept deeply rooted in the common law: and so, in such cases, is the power of a court to say whether a particular decision of that fact is or is not within the bounds of reason.’Business Common Sense  In the interpretation of reasonableness in SFAs, the term ‘business common sense’ plays an important role. For example, the persona of the reasonable businessperson was key in establishing what amounted to ‘reasonable endeavours’ in Woodside. There, the court acknowledged that the meaning of the terms of a ‘commercial contract’ were to be determined by what ‘a reasonable businessperson would have understood those terms to mean’ and accordingly, ‘reasonable endeavours’ are not an absolute obligation; there are boundaries. It is necessarily conditional on what is reasonable in the circumstances, which can include circumstances that may affect a drafter’s business. It was determined that the ‘reasonable endeavours’ clause was held to mean that the non-drafters do not need to forego or sacrifice their business interests when using reasonable endeavours to uphold their contractual obligations.  Cypjayne v Babcock is another case that drew on commercial savoir faire to determine the reasonableness standard. There, the court had to decide whether the ‘reasonable commercial endeavours’ clause in a negotiated contract allowed the buyer to withdraw from a conditional commitment to purchase a retirement village once it decided that it was not in its commercial interests to proceed. The court held that ‘best’ and reasonable endeavours clauses generally imposed similar obligations, being a standard of ‘reasonableness’ that could be measured by  Hospital Products, 92. Mason J.

ISoF 2021 ‘what is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the nature, capacity, qualifications and responsibilities of the licensee viewed in light of the particular contract.’ Here, the word ‘commercial’ indicated that the parties ‘contemplated the possibility of some commercial steps being needed’ to enable the condition precedent to be fulfilled. This was different from ‘merely making reasonable endeavours to draft documents’ to give effect to arrangements that had already been agreed upon.  Reasonable or rational?  Much commentary exists on the overlap between reasonableness and proportionality and between reasonableness and rationality. Californian torts law professor Gregory Keating highlights the difference between the two concepts; suggesting that reasonableness applies to many people and includes a diverse range of aims or aspirations; while rationality is personal and can be understood as single actors pursuing their own self-interest in an intelligent way.According to Keating:  When we act reasonably, we restrain our pursuit of self-interest by acting in accordance with principles that fix fair terms of cooperation. Reasonable principles reconcile the conflicting aims and interests of different people on terms that each could acknowledge as legitimate if they were to change places with those burdened by the pursuit of their ends. When someone acts rationally, but unreasonably, she pursues her self-interest effectively, but fails to exhibit sufficient respect for the equally legitimate interests of others.In the context of Australian case law, reasonable seems to have two meanings – having a ‘rational’ basis or being ‘appropriate’ in the circumstances. In several cases, rationality has been used as descriptor in defining a test for ‘reasonableness’. Specifically, in McKinnon v Sec Dept reasonable was taken to mean ‘not irrational, absurd or ridiculous’. While in Australian Fisheries the notion of being ‘objectively reasonable’ is outlined to mean ‘rational, based on reason, or capable of sustaining belief’, requiring ‘the objective reasonableness of the accused's belief to be assessed by reference to the subjective circumstances in which the accused was placed, including the accused's personal attributes and the information available to him/her at the time.’  Cypjayne v Babcock [2011] NSWCA 173, 67, citing Mason J in Transfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited [1980] HCA 15; (1980) 144 CLR 83, 100 and 101.

ISoF 2021 HO ARE THE PARTIES TO A RANCHISE GREEMENTLord Hoffman may have been talking about franchisees and their franchisors when comparing the approach of parents and landlords.  whereas the reasonable parent displays an almost saintly altruism, the reasonable landlord is entirely selfish.To borrow from Lord Hoffmann’s 1995 Lord Upton Lecture, it is instructive to see who is sitting on today’s Clapham Omnibus on their way to a franchise exhibition at Sydney’s Darling Harbour Convention Centre. ‘The passengers who used to be distinguished by their ordinariness, have become a rather mixed bunch’. Each is thinking about a specific role in relation to a franchise business.  Let us imagine that one is Julia, the Chief Operating Officer of the Australian subsidiary of a franchisor that is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange. She is beautifully groomed, has a business degree from a good university and has been in various roles in the franchisor for 10 years. Her salary, bonuses and job are secure. She has no doubt that franchising is a wonderful business form.  Next to Julia is a man in a well-cut suit. He is the partner in a big city law firm that acts for Julia’s company. He is deep in thought, going over the talk he is going to give at the franchise exhibition. He checks that he has his business cards with him to hand to international franchisors at the exhibition – they are prospective new clients.  Chatting to each other in the middle of the bus are two young people dressed in office attire. They are from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’). They will be at the regulator’s booth for the morning, to answer questions about the Franchising Code of Conduct. They have resources about the Code, and unfair contract terms to distribute. Sitting near the back is Bakti. He is from Indonesia. English is his third language. He does not speak it fluently. His wife has multiple sclerosis so Bakti is looking for a business that will help sustain his family financially into the future, aware that he might not be able to work in the business full time himself if his wife’s health deteriorates. He is confident that he will find what he wants in a franchise.   Lord Hoffman, Anthropomorphic Justice: The Reasonable Man and His Friends, (1995) 29 Law Tchr. 127, 137. 105 Lord Hoffman, Anthropomorphic Justice: The Reasonable Man and His Friends, (1995) 29 Law Tchr. 127. ISoF 2021 In the seat in front of Bakti is Angelo. He had also dreamed of financial stability. In 2003 after spending 30 years in the finance industry in senior roles, he bought a franchise. He and his wife had always wanted to operate a small business. They invested their life savings in a pizza franchise. He wasn’t heading to the exhibition. His destination was the Federal Court as he was in a dispute with his franchisor. All these passengers think of themselves and their views as reasonable. Any rational person, given the opportunity, will create a contract that is in their best interests. A natural imbalance thus arises in the drafting of standard form franchise agreements. The ACCC defines a standard form agreement as one where there is little basis for terms to be negotiated. The business format franchise agreement is a SFA. the most important form of conflict avoidance used today... It can exist because under most legal systems the principle of \"autonomy\" of parties to contracts is recognised, so that parties are free to include in their contract terms of their choice which do not run counter to national law or public policy.A franchise agreement will calibrate numerous requirements using the word ‘reasonable’ to make them appear less one-sided, fairer and to retain flexibility in their application. For example, the 7-Eleven USA 408-page long disclosure package, including franchise agreement, contains over 55 situations when reasonable is used. These are: ‘reasonable amount, mutually agreed, reasonable business and related requirements, a commercially reasonable effort, within a reasonable period of time, a reasonable and representative quantity, upon [franchisee’s] reasonable request, perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance, reasonableness of significant accounting estimates, [the franchisor] believes to be reasonable, expenses and other liabilities are reasonable estimates, [franchisee] agree[s] that the terms of this Agreement are acceptable to you, and are material and reasonable, agreement contains reasonable limitations, reasonable cost, a reasonable number of samples, a reasonable opportunity to cure, the reasonable cash equivalent, in your or our reasonable belief, in our reasonable opinion, total reasonable purchases, reasonable conforming changes, in our sole and reasonable opinion, in our reasonable judgment and regardless of the classification by you or the Internal Revenue Service, reasonable operating standards, at any time upon reasonable notice, that 10 days' notice of any intended sale or disposition of any Collateral is  Atwell, C. & Buchan, J.

John Goldring, Unification and Harmonisation of the Rules of Law, (1978) 9 Fed. L. Rev. 284, 290.  ISoF 2021 reasonable, within a reasonable time after we learn of it, to the reasonable satisfaction of [a mandated supplier], provide [franchisees] with reasonable training, allow [supplier] reasonable space, a reasonable allocation of risk, reasonable attorneys' fees, beyond such party's reasonable control, reasonable steps, when the Director has a reasonable basis to believe, reasonable discretion, as determined by [supplier] in its sole but reasonable discretion, in its reasonable judgment, its reasonable costs, allow [suppliers] reasonable access’. It is clear that the determination of reasonable in any or all of these contexts would require careful consideration of a daunting range of factors.  Franchisors Franchisors are the originator of the franchise concept; then whoever that person sells their business to becomes the replacement franchisor. The franchisor instructs their law firm to draft a franchise agreement. This lawyer is often a member of a big-end-of-town legal team. The brief is for the legal team to make sure the client’s interests are protected. The franchisor client wants adequate compliance with the law, enough clarity, a one-size-fits-all solution, maximum control, consistency, and optimal risk minimisation. They may also want to disincentivise franchisees from pursuing disputes. The franchisor who Julia’s franchisor engages knows, as drafter of the SFA, that even if Bakti and his fellow prospective franchisees read the fine print they cannot negotiate as individuals for the removal of unfavourable terms. They will accept the franchisor’s explanation that the terms must be there to protect the whole system from free riders.  Franchisors today may be the entrepreneur who dreamed up the idea, or a public listed company, a trust or a venture capitalist. Regardless of who they are, they have the upper hand in the drafting of all contracts between themselves and their franchisees. Franchisees The 2016 census stereotypes the ‘typical’ Australian to bea 38-year-old Australian-born of English ancestry. She is married, has two children and lives in a house with three bedrooms. The typical Australian-born male is 37 years old, while the typical migrant was born in England and is 44 years old. Looking around us in cosmopolitan cities like Sydney it is clear that many people who enter SFAs in Australia, including many franchisees, do not fit  7-Eleven Inc, Convenience Stores Uniform Franchise Registration, 2003, Minnesota.  2017 Australian Census.  ISoF 2021 these stereotypes. For example, 7-Eleven franchisees in Australia are from 22 countries, with the highest proportions being from India, China and Pakistan.SFAs are take it or leave it contracts. They are widely used in circumstances where a ‘weaker’ party cannot easily shop around for better terms. They are also widely used in business to business contracts in the context of purchases requiring high sunk costs such as vehicles, retail shop leases, and franchise agreements. How can the reasonable consumer respond? The owner of a new vehicle has access to consumer warranties if the vehicle turns out to be a lemon. The counterparty to a franchise agreement has no ‘as of right’ statutory safety nets if the franchisor turns out to be a lemon, and they are stuck in a long-term relationship regulated, principally, by the terms of a SFA. What, then, is reasonable from the perspective of the prospective franchisee in the context of taking or leaving a standard form franchise agreement? EFINING THE EASONABLE RANCHISOR OR RANCHISEEThe ‘reasonable person’ (historically known as the reasonable man) is the longest established of ‘the select group of personalities who inhabit our legal village and are available to be called upon when a problem arises that needs to be solved objectively’. Who are they? The origins of the ‘reasonable person’ are widely debated. Gary Slapper notes that the Magna Carta spoke of a ‘reasonable aid’. Others suggest that reference to reasonableness in the law can be traced to the period of Enlightenment in England in the 16 and 17 centuries.In his 18 century commentaries, Sir William Blackstone wrote that local customs must be reasonable if they are to bind as law. The first contemporary case law reference to the reasonable person occurred in England in 1703 in R v Jones. There, reference was made to ‘a person of an ordinary capacity’ in distinguishing between civil and criminal liability.

ISoF 2021 A more objective version of the reasonable man appeared in the 1837 tort case, Vaughan v MenloveThere, Mr Menlove had built a haystack close to his neighbours’ cottages. Despite being aware of the risk, he ignored the possibility that the hay might catch alight. It did. His neighbours’ cottages burnt down. He claimed he had not been negligent. The court instructed the jurors to evaluate his conduct not: by the standard of whether he had acted bona fide to the best of his judgment; [as, by that standard], he ought not to be responsible for the misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence’ but ‘with reference to the caution that a prudent man would have observed.Defining the modern-day reasonable franchisor or franchisee is a controversial and complex undertaking. As Lord Hoffmann notes in the context of identifying the reasonable for the purposes of determining liability in tort, to start by investigating ‘personal qualities which requires subjecting the defendant to an IQ test or psychological examination (short of palpable insanity) is in practice too difficult to contemplate’. As Zorzetto recognises, it is common for people to be tempted to define reasonableness by reference to the human stereotype. According to Zorzetto:  A leitmotiv in legal thinking is the judicial tendency belonging to the British common law tradition to evaluate in every field whether people's behaviour is reasonable according to the circumstances: to find a criterion, a measuring rod.While it can be safely assumed that the reasonable person characterisation is no longer satisfied by Lord Judge Greer’s 1933 portrayal that he is ‘the man who takes the magazines home and, in the evening, pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves’ or the Englishman on the Clapham omnibus, accurately encapsulating the diverse characteristics of Australia’s multicultural population and reducing them to ‘a reasonable person’ is an inherently problematic undertaking. Although it has been widely accepted that the reasonable man has been replaced by the reasonable person, the construct has not been adapted further in response to other social categories.  Roy Baker’s research concluded that approximately half the population viewed the ‘ordinary reasonable person’ as someone removed from themselves; a ‘third person’ in a 117 Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490.  118 Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490.

The Australian case law supports this conclusion. But, as Richard Bronaugh argues, there needs to be an understanding of the reasonable person’s subjective reasonableness – that their own subjective beliefs play a significant role in the reasonableness inquiry. On this, Larry DiMatteo identifies:  The subjectivity of judicial decision-making and the objectivity of the reasonable person standard can be said to have a reciprocal relationship. The reasonable person is the inevitable prisoner of the subjective judicial mind.Although the principles of reasonableness can be implied from legislation, legislation does not define the ‘reasonable person’. If required, the identity of the reasonable person in the context of a class of contracts will currently be determined by a court. As the creation of the reasonable person is context specific and an inventive act, judges and juries must assess the factual, circumstantial and cultural landscape, choosing the most pertinent characteristics in fabricating the ‘reasonable person’ in the context of the case. Relying on courts to determine ‘reasonable people’ on a case by case basis is inefficient. It will become increasingly problematic as standard form contracts are drafted using algorithms. Attempt to characterise the reasonable person in the context of an SFA can be best achieved by ascertaining the key characteristics of parties to these types of contracts in Australia.  The vagueness noted by Stone and the flexibility by Mason remain desirable features of consumer contracts, but in our opinion the contract as drafted must be understandable to the consumer to reach a threshold of fairness. In the Federal Court, Beaumont J noted that ‘[R]easonableness is a concept deeply rooted in the common law: and so, in such cases, is the power of a court to say whether a particular decision of that fact is or is not within the bounds of reason’.This power of the court remains true, but problems we now face are that courts are extremely busy and online contracts are being drafted by non-lawyers. Consequently, online contracts are inflexible and arguably often not ‘fit for purpose’ as they contain clauses that are in breach of the Australian Consumer Law, may require dispute resolution by arbitration in a distant jurisdiction, or are even written in a foreign language with no English translation available. Increasingly they will be entirely written using algorithms. This provides speed and  Baker, R.

It also provides an opportunity for the contracts to be far better tailored to the needs of the specific classes of consumer if we know who that reasonable person is. Consistent with trends in the law of construction (that courts consider commercial context when interpreting contracts), it seems that reasonableness is being tied to what is commercial and what commercially interested parties would be taken to have intended. For example, in cases considering ‘reasonable endeavours’, the courts seem to have viewed this concept as watering down a straightforward obligation to do something so that the party who is bound to exercise ‘reasonable endeavours’ to do something is afforded some leeway in how far they go to doing that thing if it turns out not to be the best commercial option at the time, or that there is some other course which would involve less of a sacrifice of the obligees’ commercial, operational or financial interests.What the courts say about ‘reasonable’ in the context of B2B contracts The appeal of ‘reasonable’ in the judicial lacunae is its ability to act as a sponge. It is a porous notion, capable of absorbing the facts and circumstances of the case. In defining what is reasonable the Australian courts have been primarily concerned with the following contexts: reasonable excuse,reasonable endeavours, reasonable care, reasonable due diligence,reasonable use,reasonable grounds, reasonable doubt, reasonable cause, and reasonableness from the promisee or promisor’s perspective. Contracts considered by courts have often been negotiated contracts, not SFAs, with the recent exception of contracts that may breach the unfair contract terms provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act2010 (Cth). Whereas courts acknowledge the impossibility of arriving at an all-encompassing definition, judges have seen the concept as situation and context dependent, and subjective in character.

ISoF 2021 As Russell Korobkin identifies – the ‘reasonable expectations doctrine’ permits courts to invalidate form terms that defeat the expectations of reasonable consumers.The typical contract that is litigated to conclusion is a negotiated contract. Hence, there is relatively little guidance from Australian courts about what is reasonable in the context of standard form contracts. In the business to business (‘B2B’) environment standard form contracts are widely used by retail landlords and by franchisors. A reasonable person becomes owner of a franchised business after signing a franchise agreement. The terms of a unit franchise agreement, a form of SFA, are rarely adapted for specific counter parties. This refusal by the drafter to adapt SFAs to address the wishes of counter parties is one reason that SFAs are seldom read.A franchise agreement is categorised as a B2B transaction but, at the point the franchisee is committing to it, closely resembles a business to consumer transaction. The Franchising Code of Conduct requires parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith with respect to any matter arising under or in relation to the negotiation of a proposed agreement, a formalised agreement or the code.Virk Pty Ltd (in liq) v YUM! Restaurants Australia Pty Ltdone of the issues for the court to decide was whether the franchisor of the Pizza Hut brand was obliged to act reasonably, in an objective sense, in performing its part of the standard form franchise agreement. Reasonableness is relevant in assessing whether good faith existed.  Reasonableness … goes to the quality of the conduct, here in exercising the price setting power, to discern whether it was capricious, dishonest, unconscionable, arbitrary or the product of a motive which was antithetical to the object of the contractual power.  Conduct attended by any of those qualities could never be said to be in good faith.  … Where,there is a finding of good faith (or, specifically, a finding that there was an absence of bad faith…) attaching to the exercise of the contractual power, then that exercise must necessarily also have been reasonable.Citing Renard Constructions, the Virk court observed, Renard Constructions, Priestley J (Handley JA agreeing) concluded that a particular contractual power, including a power to vary or cancel the contract, was required to be exercised reasonably [168]. His Honour observed (at 263) that the kind of reasonableness to which he was referring had much in  Korobkin, R. (2003). Bounded rationality, standard form contracts, and unconscionability.

ISoF 2021 common with the notions of good faith found in many European civil law systems, and all states of the United States of America, as necessarily implied in many kinds of contract. But, in the Renard Constructions case, the contract being examined was a negotiated contract, not an SFA like the single unit pizza franchise contracts in Virk.  Another agreement, this time relating to the Burger King franchise and its Australian area developer, Hungry Jacks, was considered in the Virk decision. This case concerned the Area Developer Agreement. While much of the contract is an SFA, the remainder will have been vigorously negotiated. Virk noted: The New South Wales Court of Appeal in Burger King considered the existence and scope of an implied obligation of good faith and reasonableness in a commercial contract.  [It] concluded that such an obligation attached to a particular provision (cl 4.1) in the Development Agreement ....  Burger King, the breach of the implied obligation of good faith and reasonableness was by reason of the appellant’s use of its contractual discretion under clause 4.1 for a purpose foreign to that for which it was granted.  In that case, what was reasonable was ascertained by reference to the terms of the contract. … Importantly, … it may also be seen that ‘reasonableness’ as an adjunct to an obligation of good faith has never been regarded as a duty to exercise due care and skill or to produce a reasonable outcome. Thus, the expressions within the composite phrase are necessarily and closely related.  Consideration of the reasonableness of a party’s conduct will inform the question of whether good faith or its absence has been brought to the performance of the contractual obligation or exercise of the power. This is what the court assumed in Virk but isn’t this the conduct that is exactly what the Code promotes through the modified obligation imposed on both parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith through Clause 6(6) stating that ‘To avoid doubt, the obligation to act in good faith does not prevent a party to a franchise agreement, or a person who proposes to become such a party, from acting in his, her or its legitimate commercial interestsMore recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltdthe Federal Courtconsidered the requirement that a franchisor act in good faith. Ultra TuneAustralia Pty Ltd, is a franchisor for motor vehicle engine repair and maintenance services with approximately 200 franchises. The court found that Ultra Tune had failed to give the franchisee a reasonable time to consider the purchase of the franchise and had therefore breached its obligation to act in good faith.

ISoF 2021 ONCLUSION As we have seen, scholars from many jurisdictions have weighed in on what is ‘reasonable’ in the law, and, specifically, in contracts. Is it appropriate to continue to rely on interpreting who the reasonable is ex ante in disputes about matters regulated by franchise agreements? We think not. Apart from the franchisor-suppliers’ nod to statutory compliance, the notion of a franchise agreement as an SFA being made between reasonable people is not a given. Do Judges have the opportunity to consider whether franchisors or their franchisees were more reasonable? The answer for the overwhelming number must be ‘no’. Few franchise disputes are resolved in court. Can franchisees, and even many franchisors, afford to pay the courts to ponder such fundamental questions? The arguments about who the reasonable pizza franchisee was in YUM Brands took a full day with four barristers presenting evidence before three judges. This level of representation is beyond the reach of most. We are in trouble if we accept, as Silvia Zorzetto suggests, that: what is reasonable or unreasonable depends on both facts and values that are not predetermined. This means that abstract criteria of reasonableness do not exist at all and the reasonable is porous and context dependent.Former New Zealand Judge Sir Edmund Thomas writes that ‘a law that is out of step with the needs and expectation of the times is not serving the society it is designed to serve. It is failing in its basic function’. The ability to identify ex ante the characteristics of the reasonable person in the role of either drafter or consumer of a SFA, and the expectations that person would bring to contractual rights and duties in 21st century Australia is essential for the law of contract to serve users well. Traditional contract theory was developed at a time when there was a limited use of SFAs. Now, as SFAs continue to grow in use and prevalence for all sizes of transactions, and resolution of contract disputes through algorithms becomes popular, the concept of reasonableness and the actions and thoughts of a ‘reasonable person’ cannot be left solely to courts; it requires proactive interpretation. The challenges should be addressed ex ante to ensure that contract law remains relevant as a way of interpreting SFAs. One obligation of the commercial lawyer and the commercial judge is to understand the limits of legitimate self-interest and the relationship between self-interest, in its inherently selfish character (that is, the search for commercial gain), and honesty, reasonableness, mutual respect, reciprocity, decency and trust, being the qualities that make it possible for commercial people to be self-interested, but to at 148 Zorzetto, S.

What is considered reasonable from the perspective of the prospective franchisee entering into a standard form franchise agreement will differ significantly from the standard of reasonableness that is adopted by a franchisor drafting the same agreement. Justice Brenan observed that  legislatures have disappointed the theorists and the courts have been left with a substantial part of the responsibility for keeping the law in a serviceable state, a function which calls for consideration of the contemporary values of the community.Given the high-stakes nature of business format franchise relationships, and the reliance on a standard of reasonableness, it is not a satisfactory outcome for franchisees to determine what amounts to reasonable conduct retrospectively and only after an issue or dispute arises. This article has documented the current reality facing prospective and current franchisees. Future research and inquiry should focus on determining the ex-ante determination of such a standard of reasonableness in the context of standard form agreements.150 Chief Justice Allsop AO, Values in Law: How they Influence and Shape Rules and the Application of Law, 20 October 2016. 2016 Hochelaga Lecture, Centre for Comparative and Public Law Faculty of Law, University of Hong Kong.

Franchisees as opportunistic agents or trusted stewards Abstract This conceptual paper critiques the traditional view of franchisees as agents of the franchisor, an approach that has dominated the franchise literature, and proposes a conceptual model of franchisee stewardship. We argue that the atomistic perspective of human nature associated with agency theory may promulgate franchise governance systems which actually promote the opportunistic behaviors they seek to reduce. In contrast, by adopting a communitarian philosophy, we propose that instead of viewing franchisees solely as agents, franchisees should also be considered as potential stewards of the franchise system. We explain how such a complementary perspective could provide novel insights for theory development and practice. Key words: agency theory, communitarianism, stewardship theory, organizational identification, franchising. What does it mean to be a franchisee?  Franchisees as opportunistic agents or trusted stewards INTRODUCTION This paper explores the relevance of stewardship theory for studying franchisee behaviors within franchise organizations. We contrast this with the dominant theory in the franchising literature (and indeed the wider management literature), that of agency theory (Barthélemy, 2011). Whilst researchers have begun to respond to indications by various scholars (such as Combs, Michael & Castrogiovanni, 2009; Dant, Grünhagen & Windsperger, 2011; Gillis, McEwan, Crook & Michael, 2011) to look beyond the traditional agency explanations of franchising, this theory still dominates. The agency approach sees franchisees as agents with divergent interests to the principal (franchisor). Thus, much of the franchise literature explores how franchisees can be monitored and controlled to ensure that they do not engage in opportunistic behavior to the detriment of the system (Barthelemy, 2011; Brown, Weaven, Dant & Crosno, 2016; Dant & Nasr, 1998).  The dominant view of franchisees as opportunistic agents is interesting, as many scholars (e.g. Brickley & Dark, 1987; Castrogiovanni, Combs & Justis, 2006; Rubin, 1978) explain franchising as a means of reducing the agency concerns associated with company ownership. Since franchisees are residual agents, whose compensation is directly tied to the performance of their outlets (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2009), franchising should help align the goals of the principal (franchisor) and agent (franchisee). As such, franchisees should be less likely to shirk than employee-managers. Similarly, franchising should overcome issues of adverse selection. Unlike managers who may be incentivized to misrepresent their skills and abilities (Chrisman, 2019), franchisees are assumed to have little incentive to misrepresent themselves, given they are making substantial upfront investments into the system, and their income is directly linked with the performance of their outlets (Shane, 1996). Thus, franchising should alleviate concerns of agentic behavior. Nevertheless, the literature still considers franchisees as agents with tendencies to free-ride on the efforts of the franchisor and other system members (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2009). We propose that our understanding of franchisee behaviors, and therefore system outcomes, can be improved by employing an alternate and complementary perspective to the agentic one, that of stewardship. Stewardship theory explores “situations in which managers are not motivated by individual goals, but rather are stewards whose motives are aligned with the objectives of their principals” (Davis, Schoorman & Donaldson, 1997, p. 21). We propose that franchisees should be seen as potential stewards of the system, and factors which might help promote stewardship behaviors should be explored. In this regard, we argue that the application of stewardship (rather than agency theory) has important implications, because, as Ghoshal notes (2005, p. 77), “a theory that assumes that people can behave opportunistically and draws its conclusions for managing people based on that assumption can induce managerial actions that are likely to enhance opportunistic behavior among people” (emphasis added). Thus, our purpose here is to show how ignoring other potential premises for explaining behavior (beyond agency) within franchise relationships, can lead to incomplete or potentially unreliable conclusions.  It is not our intention, however, to refute the role of agency theory in franchise research, but to contribute by showing why and how stewardship theory should also be incorporated, based on realistic and relevant assumptions, as Chrisman (2019) and Purkayastha, Veliyath and George (2019) emphasize. Whilst stewardship perspectives are not new to the entrepreneurship literature, its application has essentially been restricted to family firms (Chrisman, 2019; Lim, Lubatkin & Wiseman, 2010; Lumpkin, Steier & Wright, 2011; Madison, Holt, Kellermanns & Ranft 2016; Miller, Le Breton-Miller & Scholnick, 2008). Through our development of a theory of franchisee stewardship we seek to make a number of contributions. First, we consider how adopting a different assumption of human behavior can lead to dramatically different conclusions as to how to approach the management of franchisees. In seeking to understand how franchisees can be considered as stewards of the system, we challenge the self-serving assumptions about human nature upon which agency theory is based. By adopting an alternative philosophy of human nature, one that is other-regarding, we explore how social identification processes may align franchisee and franchisor goals, to enable franchisee stewardship. Second, we propose a framework of franchisee stewardship through an identification and articulation of a number of potential antecedent factors. Whilst the wider stewardship literature has proposed a number of factors which can contribute towards stewardship, this is the first paper to our knowledge, to explore and develop these within the particular context of franchise organizations. Finally, the paper provides a number of practical suggestions as to how the model can be applied in future research to enable empirical testing and further theory development. We begin the paper by exploring the key assumptions of human behavior upon which agency theory is based, and contrast these with those used in stewardship theory. Based on this discussion we then identify a number of factors which may influence the presence of franchisee stewardship and propose a framework which could be empirically tested in future studies. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN? To understand why an agency perspective of franchisees may not provide the sole explanation for their behavior, it is necessary to explore its underlying assumptions of what it means to be human. As Simon (1985, p. 293) observes “nothing is more fundamental in setting our research agenda and informing our research methods than our view of the nature of human beings whose behavior we are studying”. Agency theory has taken an atomistic perspective of the individual, i.e., a Homo Economicus view, where humans are freestanding agents who make rational decisions based on self-interest maximization (Etzioni, 2014; Rawls, 1971). This individualist philosophy has led to assumptions about shirking, opportunism and inertia in the economic analysis of companies (Ghoshal, 2005).  This Homo Economicus view of humans is not without its critics. As far back as Aristotle, there have been arguments suggesting that individuals are not purely self-regarding, but are other-regarding too. As Taylor (1985, p. 190) asserts “man is by nature of member of a community [and a] social animal… because he is not self-sufficient outside a polis”. Communitarian philosophy assumes that “human nature is to a significant extent socially constituted” (Etzioni, 1996, p. 164). Community membership creates rights and duties, where individuals strive to achieve socially affirmed and collectively valued goals (Watson, Shepard & Stephens, 1999). In this regard, the sense of self is to a significant extent constituted by the community within which the individual resides. Whilst communitarian principles have largely been used to explore the role of the state (Avineri & De-Shalit, 1992; Sandel, 1984; Taylor, 2005), the underlying philosophy has applications to organizations, as a form of community (Drucker, 1939; Melé, 2012; Solomon, 1994). In this sense, before exploring further the implications of a communitarian philosophy on franchise research, we justify our assertion that franchise systems, and indeed firms more broadly, can be viewed as a community.WHAT IS A FIRM? Within the business literature, there are two dominant views of the firm – one as a nexus of contracts, and the other as a set of concurrent interests (Melé, 2012). For those that view the firm as a nexus of contracts, the firm refers to “…a group of individuals who engage in a particular type of contractual relationship with each other” (Hessen, 1979, p. 8). In this context, employees (or in this case franchisees) are simply agents who perform some activity on behalf of the business owner (principal), and the firm is a “legal fiction” which serves as a nexus for contracting relationships (Jensen & Meckling, 1976, p. 311). Whilst this view of the firm has been extended to consider social and relational contracts (indeed, the franchise literature often refers to relational contracting [Evanschitzky, Caemmerer & Backhaus, 2016;Hendrikse, Hippmann & Windsperger, 2015;Leblebici & Shalley,1996]), the fundamental premise is that a firm is little more than a series of contracts between the principal and agents or other stakeholders (Solomon, 1994). The alternative perspective sees firms as connected networks of stakeholder interests, or “… a complex set of relationships between and among interest groups with different rights, objectives, expectations, and responsibilities” (Clarkson, 1995, p. 107). However, as Melé (2012) notes, these perspectives are insufficient in their consideration of the human aspects. Melé (2012) thus proposes that businesses should be viewed as a community of persons. A community, as defined by Solomon (1994, p. 227), is “an open-ended and immensely complex set of relationships between its members, who may, within that context, be called ‘individuals’”. This view of a business as a community has important implications in thinking about how individuals within that community behave. Communitarianism contends that people will abide by social norms to avoid social censure. Following an Aristotelean view there is an assumption that people, as naturally social and benevolent (Solomon, 1994), seek approval from other members of the community, and “by nature desire of being what ought to be approved of, or of being what he himself approves of in other men” (Solomon, 1994, p. 281). These social bonds, and appropriation of the community values, means that the social context is “to a significant extent perceived as a legitimate and integral part of one’s existence, as a ‘We’ rather than a ‘They’” (Etzioni, 1996, p. 157). Our fundamental beliefs about human nature, and the nature of the firm have important implications for theory and practice. By assuming that human beings are inherently other-regarding rather than self-serving, or at least both other-regarding and self-interested (Chrisman, 2019; Van de Ven, Sapienza, & Villanueva, 2007), this changes our predictions and explanations as to how people behave within organizational contexts. Indeed, as Ghoshal (2005, p. 85) argues, “it would vastly change our theory”. In the following sections therefore, we consider how a communitarian philosophy of human nature might influence franchisee behaviors and, consequently, management and governance approaches. A STEWARDSHIP THEORY PERSPECTIVE Franchise research has been heavily reliant on agency theory in exploring how best to manage franchisees (Barthélemy, 2011; Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Quinn, 1999). These agency arguments assume that franchisees, as agents of the franchisor, may engage in opportunistic behavior. Such behavior may entail suboptimal effort (Watson & Johnson, 2010) where the franchisee free-rides on the reputation of the system, or engages in activities that, although potentially injurious to the brand in the long run, provides benefits to the individual franchisee (Dant & Nasr, 1998). This view of franchisees as fundamentally self-serving individuals, creates assertions such as those by Kidwell, Nygaard and Silkoset (2007, p. 523) that the “…effectiveness of franchising as a successful organizational form can be undermined by failure to control opportunistic behavior”, and has led to a substantial emphasis on franchise governance, and approaches to limit the opportunistic behavior of franchisees (Brown et al., 2016; Evanschitzky et al., 2016).  The franchise literature has therefore focused on trying to solve the ‘negative problem’ of human behavior(Ghoshal, 2005). But are franchisees inherently driven by the need to gain personal advantage, or, is the primary self-interest that of the desire for approval and respect from the community (in this case franchise system)? If the former, then by introducing fiat, monitoring, and controls, opportunistic behaviors can be reduced (Goshal & Moran, 1996). If, however, the latter, then the introduction of hierarchical controls, will provide signals to managers (or in this case franchisees) that “they are neither to be trusted nor trustworthy to behave appropriately without such controls” (Ghoshal, 2005, p. 85). The controls will in themselves create a negative feeling towards the organization, increasing the propensity to behave opportunistically (Ghoshal and Moran, 1996). Within the context of franchising, where franchisees “… did not enter business to be a franchisor’s management thrall” (Kidwell et al., 2007, p. 527), it has been acknowledged that the monitoring of franchisees may produce a ‘crowding out effect’, where the intended disciplining effect of monitoring is overtaken by dysfunctional behaviors “due to decreased motivation or reactance to loss of autonomy and control” (Brown et al., 2016, p. 30).  Stewardship theory (Davis et al., 1997), underpinned by an Aristotelean or communitarian view of human nature, sees managers’ primary motivations as being to service the organization’s best interests (Pearson & Marler, 2010), i.e., to engage in pro-social behaviors which put the long-term interests of the organization (community) ahead of personal goals (Hernandez, 2012).Individuals are not just motivated by economic considerations, but also by higher level needs, such as self-actualization, through the fulfilment of personal values and aspirations (Donaldson, 1990; Le Breton Miller & Miller, 2009) and thus, even where the interests of the individual and the principal (organization) are not aligned, a higher value is placed on cooperation rather than defection (opportunism) (Davis et al., 1997). The individual perceives the utility gained from pro-organizational behavior to be higher than the utility that can be gained through individualistic, self-serving behavior (Davis et al., 1997). Under such circumstances, stewardship theory would suggest that empowering governance structures and mechanisms are the most appropriate to enhance organizational performance (Davis et al., 1997; Hernandez, 2012). It has been noted that franchisee empowerment is important in order to ensure the success of franchise system (López-Bayón & López-Fernández, 2016It is worth emphasizing that stewardship does not purport that no franchisee will behave opportunistically – but rather that in the main, they are primarily other-regarding (Wilson, 1993). Where franchisees engage in opportunistic or dysfunctional behaviors they should be punished, but not assumed to be innately self-serving. As Solomon (1994, p. 280) argues, “presume cooperation, but hit ‘em hard if they cheat”. In other words, stewardship assumptions do not preclude monitoring activities, but rather that these are grounded on trust.  CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND PROPOSITIONS Having argued that our normative perception of franchisees should involve their roles as stewards of the system, it is important to consider factors which might help promote, or indeed ‘crowd out’ (Brown et al., 2016) stewardship behaviors. Drawing from a review of the stewardship and franchising literatures we develop a conceptual framework and propositions with respect to the key antecedents to franchisee stewardship. We firstly present the framework (depicted in Figure 1), and then explore the identified antecedent factors in greater detail, and suggest potential areas for future research in relation to these.  Figure 1: A conceptual framework of franchisee stewardship As the model shows, we suggest that franchisee stewardship behaviors will be affected by the extent to which franchisees identify with the franchise organization. Organizational identification refers to the degree to which an individual’s own identity and his/her perceptions of the organization’s identity are tied together or overlap (Davis et al., 1997; Lange et al., 2015), such that through identification, an organization becomes an extension of the individual’s psychological structure (Davis et al., 1997). Employees who identify with an organization treat the organization’s successes and failures as their own, motivating them to “work toward the organization's goals, solve its problems, and overcome barriers that are preventing the successful completion of tasks and assignments” (Davis et al., 1997, p. 30). Further, employees who identify strongly with an organization, are more likely to act in protection of its values, and thus “… identification with the company serves to align the interests of individuals with organizational goals, fostering stewardship” (Hernandez, 2008, p. 125). In this regard, organizational identification is seen as critical in developing stewardship behaviors (Pierce, Kostova & Dirks, 2001).  Whilst the relationship between organizational identification and stewardship is well established, the antecedents to organizational identification are less well established (Reade, 2001). However, given that organizational identification is a form of social identification (Ashforth and Mael, 1989) it is not surprising that a number of researchers have suggested that identification is influenced by interpersonal relationships, especially between employer and employee (Edwards and Peccei, 2010; Hernandez, 2008; Tyler and Blader, 2003).  Indeed, Tyler and Blader (2003) suggest that the degree to which individuals identify with their employer will be influenced by the degree to which they treat employees fairly. However, whilst relationships with leaders are important, and indeed the importance of good franchisee-franchisor relationships have long been recognized in the literature (López-Bayón & López-Fernández, 2016), it has also been suggested that intergroup relations are influential in identification processes, with positive interpersonal relationships highlighted by a number of authors as promoting identification (Ashforth and Mael, 1989; Brown et al., 1986; Reade, 2001). We therefore propose a construct, franchise community relationships, to capture the effect of both franchisor-franchisee and inter-network relationships on organizational identification. Perceptions of franchise community relations will in turn be influenced by a number of factors. As Edwards and Peccei (2010) note, perceptions of organizational support will enhance perceptions of fairness, i.e. will improve relationship quality. Organizations that operate in a procedurally just manner provide information to employees that they are valued and respected. In this regard, providing employees (or in this case franchisees) with voice, and autonomy to ensure there are opportunities to be involved in decision making, helps signal to individuals within the organization that this is the case. We therefore propose that franchisee autonomy will influence franchise community relations, and in turn identification and stewardship. We argue that to demonstrate procedural justice, and provide ‘voice’ for franchisees, the presence of procedures and systems, or knowledge sharing routines, by which franchisees can participate in decision-making, will be important in promoting good community relations. Finally, we argue that given the role of leadership in shaping social exchanges within an organization (Pearson and Marler, 2010), leaders within the franchise organization will influence the quality of community relationships. Having introduced the model, in the following sections, we further develop our conceptual arguments, put forward a set of propositions, and where applicable contrast our arguments with the predictions from an agency lens. We review our current knowledge from the extant literature and consider potential avenues for further research which emerge from the model to further our understanding of franchisee behaviors. Organizational identification  Although there are many definitions of organizational identification (Edwards, 2005), it can be seen as a form of social identification (Ashforth & Mael, 1989), or identification with the community.  Social identity theory describes how the self may not only be deﬁned in terms of “unique, individuating characteristics that distinguish the individual from others”, but may also be extended to include social groups (van Knippenberg & Sleebos, 2006, p. 572). Ashforth & Mael (1989) propose that this approach can be applied to organizations (as a form of community), whereby individuals deﬁne the self in terms of the membership in the organization, or the perceived oneness with the organization (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Mael & Ashforth, 1992). In this sense, organizational identiﬁcation reﬂects the psychological merging of self and organization, i.e., from ‘I’ to ‘we’ (Tyler & Blader, 2000; van Knippenberg & Sleebos, 2006). Strong identification causes the organization’s values, norms and interests to be subsumed into the self-concept. Thus, as van Knippenburg and Sleebos (2006, p. 571) comment “collective interest is experienced as the self-interest (i.e., the collective self-interest), and individuals are intrinsically motivated to contribute to the collective”.  Organizational identification is accompanied by affective and behavioral components (Cremer, van Dijke & Bos, 2006; Ertürk, 2010). Individuals who identify strongly with their organization are more likely to focus on tasks that benefit the whole organization rather than self-interested objectives (Dutton, Dukerich & Harquail, 1994; Ertürk, 2010), i.e., engage in stewardship. It is thus suggested that organizational identification will be associated with co-operative behaviors, greater motivation towards achieving organizational goals, and intention to remain within the organization (Edwards, 2005; Jones & Volpe, 2011).  Therefore, strong organizational identification can create stewardship behaviors.   Despite the substantial body of work on organizational identity, there has been little research which has considered this within franchising (Watson, Dada, Grünhagen & Wollan, 2016),  and no studies to the authors’ knowledge that have directly explored the role of organizational identification by franchisees on their behavior and performance. However, there are a few studies which provide some initial insights.  Ullrich, Wieseke, Christ, Schulze and Van Dick (2007) explore the impact of identification on corporate citizenship behaviors by franchisee employees. Their study considers different levels of identification: identification with the franchisee organization (unit) and identification with the franchisor. They find that employee identification is positively related to behavior benefiting the franchisee organization (i.e. customer orientation), and the franchise system (i.e. corporate citizenship behaviors). Another study which implies positive outcomes from identification, although it does not measure it directly, but rather based on affective commitment, is that of Mignonac, Vandenberghe, Perrigot, El Akremi and Herrbach (2015). They find that affective commitment (the emotional attachment based on a sense of identification) is positively related to franchisee productivity and negatively related to franchisee opportunism.  In considering the role of identification, it is relevant to consider the potential differential effect of different levels or types of organizational identification. Lawrence and Kaufmann (2019) find evidence through their qualitative study of franchisees, that franchisees may see the identity of the organization which owns the brand (the franchisor) as distinct from the brand itself, even when they share the same name.Lawrence and Kaufmann (2019) argue that where there have been changes in the ownership or management of the franchise, the loss of the founder, or changes in relational norms, franchisees come to make a cognitive distinction between the brand and the brand owners (franchisor). Interestingly, they find some evidence to suggest that where the identities of the brand and the brand owner (corporation) are perceived to have diverged, franchisee identification is often stronger towards the brand, rather than the franchisor. In this sense, the enduring ‘community’ to which the franchisee belongs, is that of the brand, its loyal customers and fellow franchisees. Whilst beyond the scope of Lawrence and Kaufmann’s (2019) study, this does raise interesting questions about how different forms of identification may impact behaviors. For example, it might be that where identification is weak towards the franchisor, but strong towards the brand, franchisees may engage in stewardship behaviors in some contexts (so behaving in a manner which furthers the brand reputation), but opportunistic in others (for example deliberately withholding information from the franchisor). The studies by Lawrence and Kaufmann (2011, 2019) also raise interesting questions about temporal aspects of identification. Their studies suggest that identification may not be stable – they find evidence of disidentification from the franchisor, where there have been changes in ownership or management. Another situation might also be exemplified, where there has been a change in senior management at a franchise organization, comprising individuals with strong personalities, a franchisee who once identified strongly with the franchise organization might not do so anymore. Some studies have suggested that organizational identification can emerge from leader identification (Horstmeier, Boer, Homan and Voelpel, 2017), and thus changes in leadership may lead to changes in identification. We therefore argue that research exploring the potential consequences of, and antecedents to disidentification could contribute to theory development, and propose that:  P1: Franchisees who identify with the franchise system more strongly will have a greater propensity to engage in stewardship behaviors. Franchise community relationships From a stewardship perspective, community relations have been found to be important determinants of organizational identification, and therefore stewardship behaviors. Relationships play a pivotal role in organizational identification “because of the formative and sense-making role that relationships typically play in shaping one’s experience with the organization” (Sluss and Ashforth, 2008, p. 808). Indeed, a number of authors highlight the critical importance of perceptions of fairness and trust in both organizational identification and stewardship behaviors (Davis et al., 1997: Edwards, 2009; Hernandez, 2008). Just as strong relationships promote identification, conflict has been found to result in disidentification. If franchisors are perceived not to be acting fairly (either to the individuals themselves or a trusted network member or group of members), this may lead to a breach of the psychological contract that franchisees have with their franchisor. Breaches signal to franchisees (employees) that they are not valued members of the organization and can lead to disidentification (Kreiner and Ashforth, 2004; Zagenczyk et al., 2013).  Whilst the franchise literature has long emphasized the importance of fostering strong franchisor-franchisee relationships (Blut et al., 2011; Clarkin & Swavely, 2006; López-Bayón & López-Fernández, 2016), this has generally been grounded in a view of franchisees as agents of the franchisor. The literature, drawing on social exchange theory, has identified the importance of social exchanges, and reciprocity (Davies, Lassar, Manolis, Prince & Winsor, 2011; Meek, Davis–Sramek, Baucus & Germain, 2011), but often the need to control franchisees is discussed alongside these ideas. Although reciprocity has been explored in a positive sense, such that showing trust is likely to be reciprocated, the impact of ‘negative’ exchanges is less explored. In this regard, the extant literature provides few insights into how otherwise ‘other-regarding’ franchisees respond to exchanges which suggest an absence of trust. Actions by franchisors which imply an absence of trust in their franchisees, may create a psychological breach, and lead to organizational disidentification (Kreiner and Ashforth, 2004). Indeed, there is some evidence from Brown et al. (2016) that monitoring of franchisees may lead to an increase in opportunism, although they find differential effects dependent on the nature of the monitoring – behavioral or outcome – whereby behavioral monitoring actually exacerbates franchisee opportunism. They also find differential effects dependent on the quality of the franchise relationship. This suggests that agency governance may quash stewardship behaviors – that is to say, if franchisees are treated as if they cannot be trusted, this creates a psychological breach, disidentification and loss of stewardship. Whilst the extant franchise literature has highlighted the importance of franchisor-franchisee relationships, we suggest it would benefit from giving consideration to the exact relationships being explored between franchisor and franchisee. As noted by Croonen (2010) and Grace, Frazer, Weaven and Dant (2016), in exploring issues of trust, franchisees may differentiate trust in the franchisor (as an individual), and trust in the Head Office Team (as a collective). They use the term ‘system trust’ to differentiate this collective relational attribute. Given the importance of trust in promoting stewardship behaviors, these findings suggest that having a better understanding of the role of the Head Office team in creating a trusting relationship could lead to theoretical advancements. Although the extant literature provides clear evidence that franchisor-franchisee relationships matter, there is a dearth of literature that has considered how franchisee-franchisee relations may also impact franchisee behaviors. As noted earlier, drawing on a communitarian philosophy, the norms and expectations of a community (in this case franchise system) are believed to play an important guiding-role, where individuals will seek to behave in a manner which will be approved of by their community. It would, therefore, seem probable that franchisee-franchisee relationships are important in the development and retention of a strong network community.  The limited literature which has explored franchisee-franchisee relationships does suggest that they matter. For example, Grace et al. (2016) argue that franchisee camaraderie (both between franchisees, and franchisee camaraderie with their franchisor) is an important component of a team culture, which in turn helps create trust in the franchisor. Rometsch and Sydow (2006) argue that social space is important for promoting organizational identification, and suggest that franchisee based groups and conferences could provide avenues for franchisee organizational identity to emerge. Whilst couched in agency theory, Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2011) contend that inter-franchisee networks are a means of limiting franchisee opportunism. We propose that their research could be extended to determine whether inter-franchisee relationships promote identification and stewardship behaviors, rather than simply focusing on reduction of agentic concerns. Inter-franchisee networks may also be important in understanding knowledge-sharing processes (Paswan and Wittman, 2009; Meiseberg et al., 2017). Meiseberg et al. (2017) suggest that by building inter-franchisee relationships, franchisees can form advice networks to help individuals become more productive. Thus, the knowledge-sharing routines that the franchisor establishes may have important implications not just for franchisor-franchisee relationships, but also for inter-franchisee networks. This could be particularly relevant for systems operating in collectivistic cultures, where a high value is placed on social ties (Leeds, 1998). Indeed, in China the term guanxi signifies a kin-like tie (Leeds, 1998) where the informal personal connections between individuals create an implicit psychological contract (Yeung, Brookes & Altinay, 2016). Interestingly there has been almost no research which has considered the role of guanxi in franchise networks (Yeung et al., 2016 being the notable exception), despite the large Chinese diaspora. Whilst we argue that franchise system community relationships promote identification and stewardship behaviors, it also seems probable that strong identification may help promote strong community relationships. This can be explained by homophily (similarity attraction) (Reagans, 2005); individuals with similar values are more likely to be connected and to communicate with each other. Indeed, Reagans (2005) finds that identification increases the likelihood of strong ties. It is therefore proposed that:  Cohesive franchise system community relations, with respect to both inter-franchisee network relationships and franchisee-franchisor relationship quality, will have a positive influence on franchisees’ organizational identification. : Strong organizational identification will have a positive influence on franchise system community cohesion. Franchisee autonomy Although in the organizational identification literature, autonomy has been seen as having a positive impact on identification and stewardship behaviors (David et al, 1997; Edwards, 2009), within the context of franchising, and its associations of a highly standardized system, the extent to which franchisees can be granted autonomy has been a source of debate (Watson & Dada, 2017). Central to the arguments are that autonomous franchisees may engage in adaptations which may be injurious to the brand; thus, their role should be reduced to simply executing standardized practices and procedures set out for them by their franchisors (Watson & Dada, 2017). But, under stewardship assumptions, franchisors should trust franchisees not to engage in behaviors that would be detrimental to the brand, and maximize autonomy to exploit stewardship (Davis et al., 1997). Given franchising is often sold to franchisees as an opportunity to be their own boss (Dada & Watson, 2013), autonomy may be seen as part of the psychological contract that the franchisee has entered into, and therefore attempts to quash franchisee autonomy may demotivate at the least, and lead to agency (opportunistic) behaviors at worse. Indeed, a recent study by Watson, Senyard and Dada (2020) finds that franchisees who felt their autonomy is unfairly limited, engage in innovations that are ‘hidden’ from the franchisor, suggesting that restricting franchisees’ autonomy may actually be counterproductive.  The impact of franchisee autonomy on franchise performance has attracted some empirical research. For example, López-Bayón and López-Fernández (2016) suggest that where decision-making authority is withdrawn from local advertising and human resource decisions, franchise terminations will increase. However, they also suggest that franchise systems will benefit from centralizing pricing, as the decentralization of pricing decisions may encourage intra-system price competition. Underlying this assertion is an assumption that franchisees are self-serving rather than being concerned with the community of which they are part. Whilst López-Bayón and López-Fernández (2016) do find empirical evidence to support their argument, they also highlight the need for contingent factors to be considered. It might be that agency governance has dismantled a sense of community among the franchisees, and thus other-regarding behaviors are not apparent. Kidwell et al.’s (2007) study provides some support for this – they find that centralization (i.e., reduced franchisee autonomy) has counterproductive effect on free-riding behaviors. Furthermore, the results from Watson, Dada, López-Fernández and Perrigot’s (2020) international study of franchisees from four countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Spain) suggest that having proactive franchisees who are engaged in entrepreneurial behaviors enhances franchisor-franchisee relationship quality.  It would seem, therefore, that attempts to unduly curtail the franchisee’s ability to engage in local market adaptations (through restricted autonomy) may impact franchisee community relations, and in turn stewardship behaviors. We therefore propose that: : Franchisee autonomy will have a positive influence on franchisor-franchisee relationship quality. Knowledge sharing routines  The governance processes and structures used to manage franchisees we believe will have important implications for community relations, organizational identification and franchisee stewardship. To ensure perceptions of procedural justice, a sense of ‘voice’, and of being valued and respected, knowledge sharing routines and processes which facilitate communication and provide opportunities for franchisees to participate in decision-making will be key (Edwards and Peccei, 2010; Tyler and Blader, 2003). Indeed, a number of authors suggest that agency governance may promote the very behaviors it seeks to avoid (Davis et al., 1997; Ghoshal, 2005; Ghoshal and Moran, 1996; Hernandez, 2012) if assumptions of a Homo Economicus model of man are incorrect.  A number of studies within the extant franchise literature highlight the potential role of formalized procedures and systems to promote participative practices, autonomy, and participation in decision-making (de Resende Melo et al., 2013; Gillis & Combs, 2009; Watson et al., 2016). For example, Gillis and Combs (2009) argue that knowledge-sharing routines, such as franchise councils and local and regional meetings which celebrate franchisee innovations, are significant relational assets, giving franchisees ‘voice’ within the system. Such routines or practices, by promoting frequent interactions, have the potential to ensure values and goals are being communicated, creating stronger affective bonds (or identification) (Kidwell et al., 2007). Other researchers highlight the importance of franchise councils, associations or committees in creating co-operative behaviors between the franchisor and franchisees (Lawrence & Kaufmann, 2011). Certainly, Lawrence and Kaufmann (2011) emphasize the important role that franchisee associations play in the identification process. Thus, understanding how routines and structures which promote interactions and participative practice influence identification and promote stewardship, represents a significant line of future enquiry. The work by Croonen and Bleeker (2019) provides seven key principles of ‘fair’ franchisee advisory councils, i.e. those which genuinely provide franchisees with a meaningful platform for their views to be exchanged. Future research could explore if/how the presence of these criteria in knowledge sharing structures affect identification and stewardship behaviors. Thus, we propose that:  The presence of knowledge sharing routines will have a positive influence on franchise system community relations. Leadership The importance of leadership, and in particular transformational leadership in creating strong community and organizational identification has been highlighted by a number of studies (He & Brown, 2013; Hernandez, 2008; Horstmeier et al., 2017; Pearson & Marler, 2010). Through their The seven core principles are (1) the consistency principle, (2) the bias-suppression principle, (3) the accuracy principle, (4) the correctability principle, (5) the representativeness principle, (6) the ethicality principle, and (7) the interactional principle. social exchanges with community (organization) members, leaders can create feelings of obligation, commitment and pro-social behaviors towards the organization (Pearson & Marler, 2010). Transformational leadership, “characterized by offering a purpose that transcends short-term goals and focuses on higher-order intrinsic needs” (Horstmeier et al., 2017, p. 282) enables a collective (organizational) identification.  Whilst the role of transformational leadership has been explored within the context of family firms (Davis, Allan & Hayes, 2010; Eddleston, 2008; Pearson and Marler, 2010), the potential role of leadership in franchise organizations has not been explicitly considered. Although the literature often makes reference to the importance of franchisor-franchisee relationships (Dada & Watson, 2013; Dant, Weaven & Baker, 2013; Pizanti & Lerner, 2003), this literature is largely mute as to exactly who(m) the ‘franchisor’ refers to in this context – i.e., is it the franchisor as an individual founder/leader, or the collective head office management? Particularly in large, established franchise systems, franchisees may have very little direct access to the franchisor (as an individual), but rather their exchanges may be primarily with head office managers, such as area managers. Research by Watson and Johnson (2008) does suggest that leadership can play an important role in developing a sense of shared values and community within franchise organizations. Their case analysis found instances where the (franchise) founder’s charisma had played an important role in developing a sense of family (community) within the franchise system. When this founder left the organization, this negatively impacted the sense of community. Findings by Lawrence and Kaufmann (2011, 2019) also suggest that changes in leadership can have profound effects upon identification. Future research could explore how leadership within the franchise system can promote stewardship behaviors. Pearson and Marler (2010) contend that leaders play an important initiating role in the development of a stewardship-based relationship. In this regard, the motives, or ideology of the franchisor, and senior head-office managers, will be influential. Research could explore the extent to which transformational leadership dimensions are evident and consider how these impact organizational identification and stewardship. Furthermore, the underlying ideology or identities of franchisors and their management team could be considered. Fauchart and Gruber (2011) and Gruber and MacMillan (2017) argue that the social motivation of a founder has implications for their normative beliefs as to what it means to be a successful firm founder. Fauchart and Gruber (2011) find evidence to suggest that the founder’s social identity influences entrepreneurial behaviors, actions and outcomes. Future research could explore how different social identities of the franchise founder influence the leadership styles within the system, and the impact on franchisee stewardship. Indeed, Sieger, Gruber, Fauchart and Zellweger (2016) have developed a social identity scale of entrepreneurs which could be adapted for this purpose. We therefore propose that:  Transformational franchisor leadership will have a positive influence on franchise system community relations. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Our proposed framework contributes to further theory development in the field, and provides guidance for future testing. We have sought to highlight how assumptions of human behavior inform theory and practice. Whilst we have focused our attention on franchise research, such assumptions have important implications not just in the wider entrepreneurship literature, but also business and management more generally (Ghoshal, 2005; Solomon, 1994).  We argue that the traditional perspective of franchisees as mere agents of the franchisor, based on assumptions of Homos Economicus, may not fully capture franchisee motivations. By adopting a communitarian philosophy of human nature, and through our application of stewardship theory, we provide new insights into franchise management approaches and develop a theory of franchisee stewardship. We do not, however, contend that franchise research based on agency theory is not insightful. As Davis et al. (1997) argue, neither theory is inherently superior to the other. Pure agents and pure stewards might not exist but rather, people behave to varying degrees as self-interested (potentially opportunistic) agents and other-interested stewards (Chrisman, 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand the conditions and drivers which lead to agentic or stewardship behaviors. Based on our understanding of what it is to be human, and the framework outlined here, we provide a first step for this research direction. Certainly, much of the agency-based franchise literature has highlighted the need for relational controls to foster trust and reduce the likelihood of opportunistic behaviors (Chiou & Droge, 2015; Kidwell et al., 2007).  Our premise, therefore, is that rather than assuming that franchisees will engage in opportunistic behaviors unless monitored and controlled, we take a less pessimistic view of human nature, and consider that franchisees do not enter the franchise with the intention of exploiting and damaging the brand for personal gain. Indeed, franchisee investments in the system would support this contention. Our argument is in line with Chrisman’s (2019, p. 11–12) suggestion “that most individuals will behave as stewards most of the time”. Thus, the question becomes how best to encourage and maintain pro-organizational behaviors, whilst protecting the uniformity of brand image. In this regard, it is intended that this paper will help provoke debate among franchise scholars, and encourage new avenues of research, guided by our proposed model of franchisee stewardship.  Whilst we have focused our attention on applications to the franchising context, we suggest that this may have implications in other areas of entrepreneurship research. Within the corporate entrepreneurship literature, a number of organizational factors, such as work discretion and supportive organizational structures, have been identified to encourage entrepreneurial behaviors (Hornsby, Kuratko, Shepherd & Bott, 2009). Future research could explore how entrepreneurial behaviors may differ with agentic as opposed to stewardship governance approaches.  \n",

THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING  IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY ABSTRACT Although franchise and management contracts constitute the dominant growth strategy in the hotel industry (called asset-light and fee-oriented, ALFO), no study has compared them in terms of their relative performance. This paper aims to explain significant differences between them from an organizational and managerial perspective and to assess the impact of this modal choice on hotel online scores.  First, we argue that franchise contracts are less effective than management contracts for operating upscale hotels due to the relative advantages that the latter have in transferring and enforcing tacit knowledge, typically embedded in skilled staff and very relevant in such quality-tier hotels. Second, we argue that franchising is better for large hotels because, on the one hand, its incentive structure better solves managerial shirking\" problems (typically more severe as hotel size increases). On the other hand, franchising also has advantages in situations in which the standardization and normalization of procedures are key to success (as also happens in large establishments). Our empirical findings support broadly these arguments in a dataset of 220 Spanish hotel groups, which also provide evidence that there is no single organizational solution for all situations. Several theoretical and managerial implications are also drawn.Key words: Franchising, management contract, hospitality, knowledge, online scores TO DO OR TO TEACH? THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY INTRODUCTION As has happened with the tourism industry as a whole, the hotel sector has grown significantly in recent decades. For instance, the international tourist arrivals in the world more than doubled during the 21 century. This growth has facilitated hotel firm specialization, driving companies to focus on fewer stages of the supply chain (Stigler, 1951). A clear example of this specialization is the move of the world's leading hotel groups to divest properties (i.e. real estate business) and specialize in hotel operations and brand management (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). This has resulted in the so-called asset-light and fee-oriented (ALFO) growth strategy (Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013, 2014; Li and Singal, 2019). Started by US market leaders such as Marriot and Hilton years ago, this strategy is nowadays a dominant trend in the industry (Mercier, 2020; Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017). It consists in growing by developing brands and business concepts to which they subsequently incorporate affiliated hotels that pay a fee for using those brands and concepts. Consequently, these organizational strategies are heavily based on cooperation agreements of hotel brands with other industry actors (e.g., hotel owners) to obtain the complementary assets needed to offer the lodging services (i.e., those not provided now by the hotel group like the facilities).  This cooperation between firms can be implemented in different ways that constitute the central issue of inter-organizational relationships literature since the organizational choice is key to the success of economic activities (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Williamson,  International tourist arrivals rose worldwide from 686 million in 2000 to 1.461 million in 2019, according to World Tourism Organization (available at: https://webunwto.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2020-01/Barometro-Jan-2020-EN-pre.pdf). We have not taken into account the year 2020 to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic effect which is not relevant in our analysis.  1991). In this sense, several papers have analyzed the influence on different performance measures of, first, the decision to affiliate with a brand or to remain unaffiliated (e.g. Carvell et al. 2016), and then the affiliation choice (e.g. Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosova et al2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Madanoglu and Karadag, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, these studies are substantially biased towards the analysis of franchised vs. owned establishments, probably because of the economic relevance of franchising in retailing and the interest arisen by the franchise contracts among academics (e.g.Combs, Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2004; Dant and Kaufmann, 2003 Lafontaine, 1992; Williamson 1991). Furthermore, they are not conclusive because different results are obtained with different performance measures. While some authors conclude that differences in the relative performance of governance forms are not systematic (e.g., Carvell et al., 2016; Kosová et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Vázquez, Mejía and Sánchez, 2020), others find significant impacts on various key performance indicators, such as prices, occupancy rates, or profitability (e.g. Kalnins, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014). The hotel industry has put into fashion the management contract as an organizational form similar to franchising in developing ALFO strategies (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988).  In the management contract, a hotel group that owns a well-known brand (and the related key assets such as know-how and a reservation system) agrees to use its assets in a hotel (owned by a local partner), assuming, unlike the franchise agreement, the management of this property directly in exchange for a share of the revenues (base fee) and profits (incentive fee). In franchising, the hotel group (franchisor) standardizes the business format and creates the franchise package to transmit the know-how that enables the local partner (franchisee) to replicate the business concept successfully and to run it on its own, in exchange for a franchise fee (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009).  Conversely, in the management contract, the hotel group (the management company) has not to transfer so explicitly its know-how, because its personnel does run the property directly (Ferrary, 2015). In other words, the hotel group has to “teach to manage” in franchising while it has to “manage by itself” the property in a management contract. We argue that this difference between “to do” or “teach to do” is not trivial for hotel management.  Surprisingly, and despite the relevance of management and franchise contracts in the hotel industry −the European average of management contracts and franchises in major hotel chains is 21% and 50% and, in the US, it is 13% and 85% respectively (Collins and Perret, 2015)−, little research has been done on their differences. In fact, different comparisons are observed, but not between these two forms.  Some authors group them into a single category, ALFO strategy, to compare them with ownership and/or rental (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, Izadi, and Olya, 2020; Hua, DeFranco and Abbot, 2020; Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019; Soh, Tan and Jang, 2013 and 2014). Others, more numerous, seek to compare franchising with other organizational forms, ignoring management contracts (e.g., Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015) or grouping them with company-owned establishments in a category called company-operated (e.g., Kosova, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Kosova and Sertsios, 2018) or chain-managed properties (Kalnins, 2017, Zhang et al., 2015). Fernández, González, and López (2021) differentiate all categories but mainly focuses on analyzing hybrids (franchising and management contracts) vs. vertically integrated solutions (ownerships and leasing). Similarly, the literature analyzing international hotel chains expansion also takes organizational forms as separate categories and highlight their differences (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018), but they do not analyze the effect on performance, but the probability of choosing one form depending on host country characteristics and other contextual factors.  This paper aims to compare the performance of franchising and management contracts, studying whether there are systematic differences in the characteristics of the hotels in which one formula outperforms another. Although our main argument is that no governance mode is universally superior to others for promoting performance, we hypothesize that franchising and management contracts differ in terms of assets allocation and control, which yield two effects. The first is related to how the managed/franchisee firms access the knowledge needed to run the hotel according to brand standards and routings (i.e., knowledge transfer problem). The second effect is linked to the capacity of both types of contracts in preventing misbehaviors and managerial shirking at the local level. We maintain that management contracts outperform franchising for transferring tacitknowledge because it works better “to do” than “to teach to do”, especially when tacit know-how is relevant. On the other hand, we support that franchising outperforms management contracts when shirking and the need for routinization are significant issues. Our performance variable is online scores, a key performance indicator in the tourism industry (e.g., Sainaghi et al., 2017; 2019).   This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, comparisons of aggregated conceptual categories, usually hybrid forms versus more integrated hotels, have been the standard so far in the literature on inter-organizational relations and organizational economics (. Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosova, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Michael, 2000 and 2002). But this presents the problem of grouping substantially different organizational forms in a single category and the subjectivity of deciding how to group these hybrid forms.  Our contribution is to fine-tune the analysis since nowadays, with the predominance of ALFO strategies, the real choice of hotel groups is franchising or management contracts. Second, we contribute to the literature on organizational fit because our results show that management contracts fit better in upscale hotels, where the business requires more tacit knowledge, suggesting that the transmission of know-how is more effective within the organization than between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al. 2008; Shaw and Williams, 2009). This highlights a franchise weakness: the transfer of this type of knowledge when it is key for succeeding (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). Similarly, we show that franchise moderates the negative size effect on performance (Kosová and Sertsios, 2018). This suggests that its higher standardization capabilities, combined with its higher-powered incentives, make the franchise a better organizational form than management contracts in large hotels. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Inter-organizational relationships literature has highlighted the existence of a wide variety of contractual solutions to facilitate inter-firm cooperation and thus gather the specialized assets needed to produce an economic activity (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Williamson, 1991).  The hotel sector is a canonical example of this diversity, as hotel firms offer lodging services in establishments operated under very diverse contracts among real-estate and hotel proprietors (Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dahlstrom et al. 2009; León, Villar, and Pla, 2011; Li and Singal, 2019). In this context, franchise and management contracts stand out as prevalent governance solutions used by large hotel groups to achieve rapid expansion in the industry (Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017; Collins and Perret, 2015; 2019; Mercier, 2020). Both types of contracts have significant similarities that have led them to be jointly analysed in the hospitality literature. In a franchise agreement, the franchisor (brand owner) owns a business concept and grants the right to operate it to the franchisee (hotel owner) for a period in exchange for a franchise fee (Brickley and Dark 1987; Rubin, 1978). On the other hand, in a management contract, the hotel owner (managed company) hires a management company as an agent to operate the hotel business on its behalf, in exchange for a management fee and using the management company's business concept (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988). A key common feature of these two types of contracts is that the ownership of the business format (held by a hotel group) is separate from the hotel ownership/property (held by the franchisee/managed firm) (Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Melissen, van Ginneken, and Wood, 2016). Therefore, both partners must ally to exploit their co-specialized assets and provide the service. One partner (i.e., the franchisor/management company) provides the brand name and the method of doing business according to a proven business system. The other partner (i.e., franchisee/managed firm) contributes all local physical assets (facilities, furniture, fixture, and equipment) and is entitled to the hotel’s residual income. Thus, in the words of the Transaction Cost Economics literature (Williamson, 1991), both franchise and management agreements generate a hybrid form of governance that contrasts with independent or chain-owned hotels (where hotel proprietors operate them under their own brands). This shared feature of franchise and management contracts have led them to be considered equally valuable instruments for hotel groups' adoption of the so-called ALFO strategy. This strategy involves reducing real estate ownership at stake and basing revenue generation on fees charged to owners of the property (Li and Singal 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014). Precisely, through franchise and management contracts, hotel groups can grow and leverage their intangible strategic assets (e.g., brand equity, business know-how, and reservation systems) without making large capital investments; while basing their revenues on the collection of franchise and management fees The franchise fee follows a non-linear payment schedule, with a fixed initial fee plus variable continuing fees (e.g., royalty fee, advertising or marketing fee, reservation fee, loyalty fee). The continuing fees can be tied to the gross sales revenue or the number of rooms (Collins and Perret, 2019; Mathewson and Winter, 1985). On the other hand, the management fee is subdivided into a base fee and an incentive fee. The base fee can be an agreed fixed amount or a percentage of revenues or profits. The incentive fee depends on the achievement of a certain predefined profit level and is usually linked to the Gross Operating Profit (for the operator to monitor the operating expenses of the property). Thus, the incentive fee shifts financial risk from the managed company to a risk-sharing arrangement with the management company (Hua, DeFranco, and Abbott, 2020). Among the main advantages attributed to the ALFO strategy, the hospitality literature has highlighted its ability to reduce financial risks for hotel chains (Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014) and to expand the hotel business, leveraging hotel intangible assets efficiently, without huge capital investment (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002). However, although recent research does seem to confirm the risk advantages of this strategy (e.g., Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013; 2014), the evidence on its ability to improve hotel chains' performance, as measured by different financial ratios, is mixed. While some studies find a positive effect on performance (e.g., Sohn et al., 2013; Seo and Soh, 2019; Hua, DeFranco, and Abbot, 2020), other studies find only negligible differences (Bourke, Izadi, and Olia, 2020) or, even, no difference in performance between asset-light and asset-based (i.e., with significant ownership or leased property stakes) hotel groups. The lack of a clear positive effect of ALFO strategy on firms’ performance may be due, in part, to the financial difficulties caused by the decrease in the tangibility of assets (e.g., financial distress, and with it financial costs, may increase as safety brought by fixed asset collaterals lowers) (Brealey and Myers, 2002). In addition to this financial drawbacks, according to agency theory arguments (Eisenhardt, 1989), the separation of hotel (i.e., real state) ownership from its strategic intangible assets (i.e., brand name and know-how) may also lead to significant conflicts of interest, with negative consequences for the hotel group and its brand equity (Brickley and Dark, 1987; Rivas, et al. 2013; Rubin, 1978).  On the one hand, the franchisee and the managed company as residual claimants of their establishments directly receive the result of their management efforts, which usually makes them well-motivated local managers compared to hired directors of company-owned hotels (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017). However, the transfer of ownership that accompanies an ALFO strategy also implies the loss of control over hotel properties, which can cause serious inconsistencies in the quality and operations of the hotel group, impairing its ability to ensure quality consistency in their establishments (e.g.,Brookes, Altinay and Aktas, 2015; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018; Michael, 2000, 2002; Sun, Park and He; 2019). Ultimately this would result in worse service and lower customer satisfaction in franchise and managed hotels, challenging the brand performance in the medium and long term. Therefore, the effectiveness of ALFO strategies will depend on a complex balance between their financial risk implications and the severity of conflicts linked to their unique ownership structure. This study focuses on the latter, i.e., inter-firm conflicts, to analyze more in deep the comparative advantages of the two prevailing asset-light models, i.e., franchising and management contracts. Comparative effectivess of franchising vs. management contracts in ALFO strategies The success of the ALFO strategy as a preferred form of expansion may lead to the mistaken assumption that it fits, in terms of performance, all organizations in the hospitality industry (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). However, its effectiveness also depends on where and  it applies. In this regard, recent studies highlight that its benefits/drawbacks do not necessarily have to be uniform across companies or even over time. They may be contingent on factors such as the economic cycle (Sohn et al., 2014), the sector and segment in which hotels operate (Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019), or the resources and organizational skills of the chains (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). Moreover, the effectiveness of the ALFO strategy may also depend on the contractual forms that support it, i.e., franchise vs. management contracts. On this point, the inter-organizational literature has proposed that there is no universally superior organizational form (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Wiliamson, 1991). Rather, the distinctive characteristics of each organizational form make them better suited to respond to particular problems.  Yet, most studies have overlooked the comparative analysis of franchise vs. management contracts and their differential effects on hotel performance (Kruesi et al., 2018). In fact, extant research on the impact of ALFO strategies on firms’ performance has ignored this issue; regarding both contracts as a single or equivalent governance form (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, et al., 2020; Hua, et al., 2020; Seo and Soh, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013). Therefore, it is necessary a closer examination of the differences between these alternative models. Despite their aforementioned similarities, franchise and management contracts have meaningful differences in their governance structure that can alter the type and severity of conflicts between brands and proprietors and, thus, the performance of hotel firms. Contractor and Kundu (1998) recognize that the main differencelies in the degree of control over strategic business assets e.g., brand name, global reservation system, and business know-how embedded in routines and daily operations). This is because in a management contract the hotel brand retains the responsibility for directing and managing the establishment's operations. That is, the hotel brand appoints one of its own managers to run the local hotel directly, usually in collaboration with other local managers who are hired by the managed company (Brooks and Roper, 2010; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Kruesi et al., 2018; Melissen et al., 2016). Consequently, the owner of the business's strategic intangible assets (the hotel brand) has a substantial influence on most of the daily decisions of the local hotel affecting its value. In contrast, under a franchise contract, the franchisor firm has lower control over those intangible assets. This is because it has delegated day-to-day management over assets in the franchisee and none of the franchisor representatives is present daily at the local level (i.e., in the franchisee's establishments). Clearly, the franchisee has to abide by the contract and the operations manual, but he or she interprets by himself/herself how to operate the hotel establishment.  Another key distinguising feature is that the management contract is the one that entails the clearest separation between the operation of the hotel and its ownershipi.e., ownership over real state and residual income) (Melissen et al., 2016). In franchised hotels, the person who operates the establishment (franchisee) is the same person who receives the residual income from the business; however, in managed hotels, the operator (management company) is not the residual claimant.  These differences in terms of assets allocation and control can alter the ability to transfer knowledge and prevent opportunistic behaviors within the hotel chain. In this regard, our main argument is that no mechanism of governance (i.e., franchised or managed hotels) is universally superior to other, rather the effectiveness of a particular mechanism will depend on the specific context in which it is deployed. Thus, distinctive characteristics of the service provision will determine knowledge transfer requirements and main agency problems faced by hotels and then the governance form best suited to respond to them. In hypothesis form:H1. The impact of governance mode (franchise vs management contract) on hotel performance is not direct but contingent on the hotel characteristics. Management contract advantages in (tacit) knowledge transfer  Compared to management contracts franchising do require transferring the business knowledge (of the franchisor) to the franchisee, because he or she is running by himself/herself the property and needs to learn how to do it. This means that it is necessary to transfer knowledge between independent companies. Conversely, management contracts do not require any explicit transfer of knowledge because the general manager who is in charge of applying such know-how and operates the establishment has already acquired it (i.e., he or she is an employee of the management company). Consequently, here the transfer of knowledge is within the management company and among its employees (Ferrary, 2015). In this regard, organizational literature argues that the transfer of knowledge within an organization is less challenging than between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al., 2008; Shaw and Williams, 2009), which would give a potential advantage for management contracts.  In the franchise context, the franchisor has the legal obligation of transferring its own know-how to the franchisee, since it is assumed that such proprietary and distinctive knowledge is essential for the success of the franchise business (Real Decreto 210/2010). Furthermore, such knowledge is articulated into the business practicese.g., Combs and Ketchen, 1999; Barthélemy, 2008) that are subsequently conveyed to the franchisee through the contract and the operation manuals, the initial training, and the day-to-day assistance (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009).  This set of codified knowledge (i.e., franchise manuals and contracts) constitute franchisors’ main repository of knowledge (Solís and González, 2019). Conversely, in the management contract, the management company specializes in supplying its employees to the affiliated hotels. It focuses on recruiting, training, and managing qualified staff (i.e., general managers and experts responsible for specialized departments) and then assigning them to the chain’s establishments. The managed firm (i.e., hotel owner) hires the remaining line employees and focuses on the real estate dimension of the business (Ferrary, 2015). Therefore, the main repository of knowledge is not the manuals as in franchising, but the skilled staff of the hotel group, so that the strategic know-how needed to operate the business keeps in-houseFurthermore, compared to the knowledge acquired by independent franchisees, managerial know-how in management contracts is more likely to be of a tacit (non-codifiable) nature because knowledge acquisition is based on internal training, internships, and daily experiences within the  This is the case of the Spanish legal system, but similar obligations apply in other countries. chain. Internal knowledge transfer facilitates the informal links, communication, and learning by doing that is needed to develop and absorb tacit knowledge (Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). Instead, because tacit knowledge cannot be fully articulated in electronic databases or manuals (e.g.franchise operations manuals), passing on tacit business practices to independent franchisees can be particularly costly or imprecise (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2004; Paswan and Wittman, 2009).  In sum, when hotel groups need to transfer highly tacit business know-how, they should benefit more from management contracts. The category of the hotel might determine the tacitness of the knowledge to be transferred. Upscale and luxury hotels are knowledge-intensive companies and most of this know-how is more tacit and complex in nature (non-codifiable) than that of lower-category hotels (Chen and Dimou, 2005; Ferrary, 2015; León et al., 2011). Upscale hotels are also more difficult to monitor than lower-category ones. This is because it is very costly to explain and to exactly define in advance how to deliver high-value services, and thus to design reliable, internal measures for assessing them. In fact, Ehbauer and Gresel (2013) note that luxury retail is still deﬁcient in holistic performance measurement and management tools, because it is difficult to develop a framework that includes quantitative as well as qualitative key performance indicators for the efﬁcient management of luxury stores.  Therefore, in upscale or luxury hotels in which we need to transfer more tacit knowledge, the typical knowledge transfer between companies that the franchise demands, and its subsequent articulation in manuals or documents, is less effective than the transfer of knowledge within the company (i.e., based on the employees) typical of management contracts. In other words, it is easier “to do it” than “to teach how to do it”. This difficulty may result in the inability to ensure adequate compliance with brand quality standards in high-end franchised hotels. Ultimately, this will result in poorer service and lower customer satisfaction (i.e., lesser online scores) for franchised hotels compared to managed ones. Thus: H2. The interaction of franchise (vs management) contracts and hotel category has a negative effect on online scores. Franchising advantages in preventing shirking and foster standardization  The governance differences between franchising and management contracts also affect the severity of the different types of opportunism that may occur at the establishment level. First, a relevant problem in any network of geographically dispersed establishments is to prevent shirking in the effort of the local manager (Rubin, 1978). Both contracts provide a useful tool to reduce this problem because managed firms and franchisees assume the economic consequences of their decisions due to their residual claimant status on the hotel property.  However, management contracts solve probably worse this problem than franchise contracts. Unlike franchisees, the general managers of managed hotels have no residual claim on the profits of the establishments they manage because they are employees of the management company. This condition provides them with less powerful incentives to perform (e.g., to supervise hotel employees and operations closely) (Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017).  Hotel management companies monitor their behavior and introduce incentive system that aligns management company’ and general manager’ interests, like pay-for-performance programs (e.g., profit or sales commissions). However, such solutions cannot equal the incentive intensity created by the residual claims on hotel  The residual claimant status is only partially internalized by the chain in managed and franchised hotels through the collection of management and franchise fees. These fees are mainly linked to number of rooms or revenues per room (ranging 1-5%) in franchising (Collins and Perret, 2019), and mainly linked to gross operating revenue (ranging 2-4%) or operating profit (under 15%) in management contracts (Balyozyan et al., 2017).  profits of the franchisee (including the right to transfer the position of the residual claimant) (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972).  Second, high-powered incentives based on residual claimancy acentuate the free-riding problem. Franchisees and managed hotels can use their leeway to free-ride on the brand equity and maximize the profits at local level at the expense of the whole branded-hotel group interests. This theoretical problem translates into different misbehaviours that have been largely studied, both in franchise (Brickley and Dark, 1987; El Akremi et al., 2011; Kidwell et al., 2007) and in management contracts (van Ginneken et al., 2019; Schlup, 2004; Turner and Guilding, 2010).   There are also differences in how free-riding is solved under both types of governance forms. We argue that management contracts reduce easier the free-riding problem than franchising because the former has an advantage over the latter in terms of supervision and monitoring.  The general manager of the managed hotel, i.e. an employee of the hotel management company, holds much better position to monitor and to prevent any opportunist behavior within the hotel he/she runs (the managed company) than the auditors, external supervisors or mystery shoppers that the franchisor could set in to control the franchisee behavior. In sum, management contracts solve the problem of free riding on brand equity better than the franchise contracts but worse the problem of managers’ shirking. The hotel size is a feature that probably affects more the severity of the shirking problem than that of the free riding. The reason is that we are referring to the size of a property, not the size of the network that could affect the free-riding of shared assets. In this case, the number of rooms or guests affects the effort that the hotel general manager has to make (related to shirking), and not the use of shared assets (related to free riding). Large hotels demand greater efforts from staff and management team than small hotels because mistakes are more harmful in the former than in the latter.  A management error in a large hotel can be extremely costly because of the number of employees, assets and guests involved.  They require more planning than smaller hotels because, due to the size of their operations, nothing can be left to chance (i.e. their responsiveness capacity is very limited) (Hodari and Sturman, 2014).   In this line of reasoning, Kosová and Sertsios (2018) found that franchised hotels far away from their franchisor’s headquarters are larger and generate higher revenues. They run a similar analysis for company-managed hotels that showed they were not significantly greater. The revenue premium in franchised hotels is largely explained by the size specified by the franchisor when the hotel starts its operations. It means that up-front investment requirements (higher in larger hotels) are utilized in self-enforcing and denote a positive relationship between the use of franchise and hotel size. Consequently, it seems likely that the franchising should offer better results in large hotels than management contracts.  Furthermore, large hotels require more normalization of procedures than the smaller because other coordination mechanisms (e.g. mutual adaptation or direct supervision) are not effective in this type of organizations (machine bureaucracy in terms of Mintzberg, 1979) (Baker and Cullen, 1993; Sutton and Dobbin, 1996).  Franchising has an advantage in working under normalized environments compared with management contracts because the franchisee is used to employ routines. Franchise businesses demand to develop a set of formal and routine procedures to transfer their explicit knowledge and practices to franchisees (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). The potential cognitive, cultural and/or interest distance with their franchisee partners, together with the impossibility of resorting to hierarchical authority to oversee their behaviours, means that they have to develop routine procedures, rules and policies (contained, for example, in the franchise manuals) to guide the cooperation between the partners (Knott, 2003; Winter, Szulanski, Ringov, and Jensen, 2012).  In fact, the ability to create \"standard operating routines\" to communicate and transfer them to their franchisees is considered a key alliance capability in franchise chains (Gillis et al. 2020). Moreover, we expect this \"alliance management capability\" to represent a differential advantage of the franchise agreement to ensure coordination and standardization in contexts where it poses more problems, such as in large hotels. In sum, it can be expected that: H3. The interaction of franchise (vs. management) contracts and hotel size has a positive effect on online scores.EMPIRICAL SETTING  The above hypotheses were tested on a dataset of establishments belonging to the 250 largest hotel groups operating in Spain in 2018. These hotel groups were running 3,105 establishments (505,752 rooms) in Spain at the beginning of 2018, out of a population composed of 3,887 hotels belonging to hotel groups (Nota, 2018).  These figures do not take into account independent hotels and they were not considered in the empirical analysis because the aim of the paper forces us to focus only on hotel chains (i.e. independent hotels are always company-owned hotels so that we do not observe variability in terms of organizational forms).  The Spanish hotel industry is an appropriate setting because it is a leading country in the tourism industry – ranking second worldwide, in 2018, for both receipts and international tourist arrivals (World Tourism Organization, 2019; p. 9) – and has a mature hotel sector. We have focussed on hotels from one single country, Spain, to control for the influence on the choice of governance form of the country and its institutions (e.g., sector organization, regulation and economic and political stability) (Lafontaine et al., 2017).  This also avoids the potential bias that country-specific features may cause on online reviews (Radojevic ., 2017). Information about the establishment features (category, size, location, restaurants, opening date, hotel group and governance form) was obtained from the Directory of hotels and apartments in Spain of Alimarket (www.Alimarket.es), the leading provider of sectorial economic information in Spain. Given our interest in comparing franchising and management contracts (using chain-owned hotels as a control group), we restricted the dataset in the following way. First, we did not consider leased hotels because we did not want to contaminate our control group with other organizational forms in which different conflicts of interest might exist (. real estate owner and the hotel group). Second, we also ruled out those establishments that their business concept was not the canonical example of hotel accommodation so that they could introduce noise in estimations. Then, we rejected apartments, focusing only on hotels and aparthotels, because core services differ significantly between them (e.g. meals, bedmaking, cleaning, etc.). Similarly, we rejected minor types such as hostels, rural tourism establishments, and holiday villages. In sum, after rejecting also those hotels for which we do not have information for all the variables, our final dataset was 1,664 hotels belonging to 220 hotel groups. 3.1 Variables The dependent variable is Score, which is the weighted mean of three website scores for each hotel after homogenizing their scales. We took these scores from Booking, Expedia, andTripAdvisor websites between March and June 2018. The weighting variable was the number of comments used to compute each website score. Such tourist websites have become an increasingly important source of information for academic studies on the hotel sector turning online reviews into a key performance indicator (Kwok et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018) and a potential source of revenues because many guests consult them before booking a room (Cantallops and Salvi, 2014). We use two different dichotomous variables to identify the status of hotel in its group. The variable Franchising takes value “1” when the chain operates a hotel through a franchise contract and “0” otherwise.  Similarly, the variable Management takes value “1” when the hotel group operates the lodging establishment through a management contract. This variable is a predictor in score estimations, but is also used as a dependent variable in an auxiliary regression because of methodological requirements. Upscale is a dummy variable that takes value “1” if hotel has more than three stars and “0” otherwise Spanish hotel classification system ranges from one to five stars. We have considered that establishments with less than four stars are different types of economy hotels. Conversely, upscale full-service hotels are those classified as 4 and 5-star hotels. They offer larger rooms and more additional services are available, especially in the 5-star hotels. These offer the most sophisticated service and the most well-appointed facilities. The variable LRooms measures the size of the hotel as the natural logarithm of its number of rooms. Renewal refers to the number of years since the hotel facility was built or renovated, and is used as a proxy of the hotel’s maintenance requirements. Restaurants is a control variable, which refers to the number of restaurants. Hotel group-z are dummy variables constructed for each of the =1, …, 220) hotel groups included in the study. The list of hotel groups has been extracted from Informe de Grupos Hoteleros en España 2018 (Nota, 2018). They aim to control for possible chain effects, such as their corporate strategy or their preferences in terms of governance forms (i.e., brands may specialize in different governance solutions). Finally, we used two variables as the main instruments to control for self-selection bias in governance form choices (this will be further discussed in the estimation section below). The first variable, Geographic concentration, measures the number of hotels belonging to the same hotel group in the same province. The second variable, Ratio of j-form hotels, measures, for each hotel , the ratio of hotels that its chain maintains in the same province with the organizational form over the total number of hotels belonging to the same chain and in the same province as hotel Table 1 summarizes the variables,  Table2 shows their descriptive statistics, and Table 3 displays the number of hotels in the dataset per governance form and category. -------------------------- TABLE 1 ------------------------------------- -------------------------- TABLE 2 ------------------------------------- -------------------------- TABLE 3 ------------------------------------- 3.2 Estimation An important concern in evaluating the effect of organizational form choice on performance is sample selection bias. This is a recurrent problem in similar studies (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Mesquita and Brush, 2008) and several authors have emphasized the relevance of controlling for it because organizational form choices are likely to be chosen systematically, not randomly (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Shaver, 1998). Hotel group managers may self-select into different governance forms (i.e. types of affiliated hotels). In other words, they could make their decision based on which option they expect to be more profitable for the hotel group in the future. This implies that a simple OLS of performance (Score) as a function of governance form leads to biased estimates (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Mayer and Nickerson, 2005).  The suggested method of correction and testing is based on Heckman (1979). This consists in running a two equations model in which the first equation is a “treatment” model to describe the self-selection decision. The second equation, the performance regression in our case, is then estimated to be adjusted for self-selection from the first equation. Maddala (1983: 120-122) and the Stata reference manual (v.14, p. 59-64) show the two-stage estimator of this model. In our case, we estimate a probit model of the treatment equation that was specified as follows: Franchising/ManagementUpscale*LRooms + Renewal +Restaurants +  Geographic concentration + Ratio of franchised hotels + Ratio of managed hotels + Ratio of chain-owned hotels + Hotel group 1 +…+Hotel group 220 + ε                             [Eq. 1]Where is a random error term and Franchising/Management are unobservable measures of the organizational form. However, we observe the chosen contract, a dichotomous variable, Franchisng/Management, with Franchising/Management= 0 if Franchising/Management and Franchising/Management= 1 if  Franchising/ManagementThe second stage analyses scores conditioned by the choice of the governance form and other hotel features as follows: Score =   β*Upscale + β*LRooms + β*Renewal + β*Restaurants + βFranchising/Management + β*Franchising/Management *Upscale+ β*Franchising/Management *LRooms+ β*Franchising/Management*Renewal + β*Hotel group 1 +…+ β*Hotel group 220 + *Mills_Ratio + ε                                                                                                                                                             [Eqs. 2]It is important to note that we have to econometrically identify Equation (1). This means that we need to introduce at least one instrument in the treatment regression (first stage) which is not considered in the performance regression (second stage). Specifically, we use Geographic concentration and Ratio of franchised/managed/chain-owned hotels as instruments for the endogenous variables (Franchising/Management). Applying a similar argument to Kosová et al.(2013), we expect that the latter, i.e., the proportion of chain hotels in a region with a particular governance form is inversely related to the unit cost of monitoring this type of establishment. From this point of view, this proportion reflects the unobserved costs of selecting a governance form within a particular region. Moreover, from a monitoring perspective, there may be scale economies at local level from developing and using the management devices needed to monitor each type of governance mode (Dahlstrom et al., 2009; Hoffman and Preble, 2003; Shane, 1996). Therefore, as the ratio of j-form hotels grows in a region, its cost relative to alternative governance forms will decrease in that area, thus increasing the probability that it will be chosen. As for the former variable, Geographic concentration of chain establishments in the province, this allows us to control for the chain size and, thus, to weight the scale economies approximated by the ratio of j-form hotels. On the other hand, these concentration measures should not directly affect online scores, which mainly depends on the service actually experienced in each particular hotel. In fact, customers are not aware of either the governance mode of each hotel or the number of establishments belonging to the hotel group in the same province. 3.3 Results The Table 4 shows main results since they reflect the performance comparison of hotels operated under franchise and management contracts. Although our interest is in the second stage, it also shows first-stage results for their methodological value (Appendix 1 summarizes descriptive statistics for two-stage estimations).  In this sense, these resultssuggest that Heckman's correction is not needed. The coefficients of the Hazard, which is the parameter that Stata uses to estimate i.e. the correlation between the error terms of equations [1] and [2]), is not significantly different from cero. We cannot then reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between these error terms and, then, the equations can be considered independent because bias selection is statistically insignificant. Furthermore, some of our instruments are statistically significant (Ratio of franchised/managed are significant and have the expected effect on the organizational form), what suggests that they fulfill the requirement that they should be correlated with the choice of organizational form so they can identify the equation [1].   Regarding the second-stage, we have estimated a baseline model with the direct effects and an augmented model in which we also consider interactive effects of the organizational form and the features of the hotels. Results of the baseline models in Table 4 indicate, first, that scores of hotels positively depend on their category and on the number of restaurants and negatively on the size of the hotel (in terms of rooms) and on the renewal date of facilities.  However, Franchisingcoefficient is not statistically significant, suggesting that none of these organizational forms is better on average in terms of scores. This is an expected result because it broadly supports the idea that there is no universally superior organizational form that works for all types of hotels (when it comes to improving their performance) (hypothesis 1).   Second, the augmented model results reflect two important findings. On the one hand, we observe that when hotel groups decide to operate upscale hotels under franchise contracts, the expected performance in terms of score is reduced (6F-M= -0.3475 p < 0.01) in comparison with those upscale hotels run under management contracts. Consequently, it seems that franchising is the worst solution for higher-category hotels, as proposed in hypothesis H2. On the other hand, franchising positively moderates the negative effect of hotel size on score. As expected in H3, we obtain a positive and significant parameter for the interactive effect in Table  (7F-M= 0.1812 p < 0.05). This means that, for large hotels, franchising is more effective than management contracts i.e., it mitigates the drawbacks of size in scores).  Please, note that these two variables do not need to sum up to 1 because we have considered in the ratios calculation the four types of organizational forms that exist. Consequently, they can be considered simultaneously in the regression. -------------------------- TABLE 4 ------------------------------------- As a robustness check, we also present the results of comparing the performance of franchised and managed hotels with company-owned hotels respectively (Table 5). The aim of adding this comparison is twofold. First, it facilitates to compare our results with extant literature and, second, helps check the soundness of hypotheses if they can also predict the differences of these new comparisons. Panel A compares franchised and chain-owned establishments (the dependent variables in the first stage is Franchising) and Panel B considers hotels operated under management contracts and chain-owned hotels (the dependent variable in the first stage is Management).  Results corroborate our previous main findings. First, Panel A in Table 5 (augmented model) shows that the choice of franchising also reduces the positive effect of Upscale on the expected score when compared with chain-owned hotels (6F-O= -0.3388 p < 0.01) meanwhile Panel B in Table 5 (augmented model) shows that managed hotels are not statistically different in terms of scores from company-owned hotels for operating upscale establishments. Both results are consistent with H2 that argues that franchising is the less appropriate organizational form to operate upscale hotels. Second, the parameter of Franchising x Lrooms is also positive and significant in the augmented model of Panel A in Table 5 (7F-O= 0.1631 p < 0.1), but it is not statistically significant the estimate of Management x Lrooms (Panel B in Table 5).which again are both coherent with H3. Finally, Management coefficient in Panel B in Table 5 (i.e., managed vs owned hotels) is significant and negative (5M-O= - 0.1122 p < 0.05), which suggests, contrary to H1, that management contracts are worse in terms of scores than the company-owned hotels, irrespective of the characteristics of the hotels. -------------------------- TABLE 5 ------------------------------------- To reinforce the above results about H2 and H3, we plotted the interaction effects, as shown in Figure 1\n",

Yet, little is known of how franchisors’ strategic use of communication can improve the number of new franchised outlets. Prior work on the strategic use of communications has identified that large franchisors communicate on the identity of the franchise system. However, little insight exists on the influence of communication of risk and returns. Understanding the communication of risk are return is vital as entrepreneurs seek to invest in franchising over independent businesses to increase returns and reduce risk. Thus, this study aims to investigate the influence of franchisors’ communication on risk and return is associated with new franchised outlets. We develop a custom database of 133 US-based franchises, we content analyzed item 1 of the Franchise Disclosure Documents to test how the communication of risk and return by the franchisors affect new franchised outlets. The findings show that risk significantly influences the number of new franchised outlets and that franchise age significantly moderates the effect of the communication of risk. However, we find no such influence of the communication of returns.  Key words: Franchising, Risk, Return, Communications INTRODUCTION In 2017, there were approximately 733 thousand franchise units in the United States contributing around 7.6 million direct jobs in U.S franchises and about $404.6 billion direct contributions to gross domestic product (The Franchise Handbook, 2017). In Australia, franchising is even bigger with three more franchising outlets per capita than the United States and more franchise outlets per capita than any other country in the world (Franchising Top Markets Report, 2016). These Australian franchises employ nearly 600,000 people (IBISWorld, 2019).    For a thriving franchising sector, adding new franchised outlets to a system is critical to franchisors to increase profitability, for achieving economies of scale, and to penetrate new markets. It is not surprising that in a 2012 survey sponsored by the Franchise Council of Australia, 77% of franchisors reported that recruiting new franchisees was one of the challenges for franchisors (Frazer, Weaven, & Bodey, 2012). In addition, the survey revealed that on average, franchisors spent $20,000 in the financial year 2010/2011 on advertising activities to recruit franchisees (Frazer et al., 2012).  Franchisors spend significant resources on recruiting new franchisees. Studies show that entrepreneurs decide to enter franchising and becoming franchisees long before choosing a specific franchise industry or brand (Kaufmann, 1999). This means that many potential franchisees have no specific preferences and will investigate the many options available to them before choosing the right franchisor. However, prior work has mostly focused on why franchisees select franchising as a business format (Kaufmann & Stanworth, 1995; Peterson & Dant, 1990). However, little attention has been paid to the franchisors’ efforts to attract franchisees into the system.  The one notable exception is Zachary et al. (2011) assesses franchise branding by examining the corporate websites of franchisors. The authors studied how franchisors communicate on their corporate websites to attract potential franchisees, including how they represent aspects of organizational identity – that market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and charismatic leadership. They find that firm size affects the rhetoric used in communicating with franchisees (Zachary et al., 2011). Similar to Zachary et al., this study also examines the role of rhetoric used in communicating with franchisees – especially how franchisors communicate on risk and return. Specifically, “the strategic use of words to persuade potential franchisees of the value of the franchisor’s opportunity” (Zachary et al., 2011; p. 630) will affect the number of new franchised outlets.            This study makes three distinct contributions to the literature and builds on Zachary et al.’s work (2011). First, in this study, we examine how the communication of risk and return affect the number of new franchised outlets. By doing so, the first contribution of this study is how franchises can grow through the strategic use of words to persuade franchisees. Mani, Wathne, and Antia (2016), in their review of emerging trends in franchising research from 2005 to 2014, advocate that more attention should be given to studying franchise system growth and acknowledge that it has received the least attention in franchising research. The second contribution of this study is to understand the role of the communication of risk and return and its effect on franchisor growth (new franchised outlets). Prior studies only looked at the trade-offs of risk and return for the franchisors. A paper by Martin (1988), for example, studied the risks and returns that are associated with a franchisor’s option of franchising as opposed to company-owned outlets. Another example is Brickley and Dark’s (1987) paper that discusses the risks and incentives for franchisors’ decisions of franchising some units and owning others by considering agency-related problems. Additional studies examined how risk influences franchisors’ decisions on fee structure (Lafontaine, 1992; Sen 1993). With respect to franchisees, Williams (1999) investigated the risk and return for entrepreneurs and evaluated the choice between franchising or being an independent owner. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research that has examined the communication of risk and return. In addition to the direct effect of the communication of risk and return, we also examine the moderating role of franchise age. Thus, the third contribution of this study is to explain the role of franchise age. The age of an organization may be perceived negatively or positively. For example, older franchises are associated with obsolescence and inertia, creating a negative perception of age. While, positive perceptions of franchise age are because of greater organizational learning, stability, and reputation of franchises. This study will also assess the extent to which franchise age moderates the relationship between the communication of risk/return and the opening of new franchised outlets.          The research data for this study was collected from 133 franchises in the United States. Two consecutive years’ Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDS; 266) for these franchises were obtained from state regulatory authority in the United States. We used text analysis tools to content analyze item 1 of the FDD and examined the influence of communication of risk and return and age on the opening of new franchised outlets.           The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A discussion of the literature review on franchise age and the hypotheses are presented. We then discuss the data, method, and results. Finally, the paper is concluded with theoretical and managerial implications of this research. LITERATURE REVIEW  Franchise Age There are many inferences that potential franchisees can make about a franchise’s age when deciding whether or not to buy a franchise. On the one hand, it has been argued that age indicates value for the potential franchisee because of the likelihood of survival and the success of older franchises (Baucus et al. 1993). In addition, when the environment remains stable, organizations improve their competence, becoming more efficient, and learn from experiences (Sørensen & Stuart, 2000). Franchisors also use their reputation to signal the value of the business (Shane, Shankar, & Aravidakshan, 2006), which is mostly acquired as the franchise grows older. It is indeed recognized that franchisees will mostly invest in a reliable franchise that is a proven business idea, having survived the first few years, and that is already established with profitable franchised or company-owned outlets successfully running.            On the other hand, as age increases, franchisees consider other factors related to a franchise’s age and life cycle. Potential franchisees might view older franchise systems negatively for several reasons. One theory argues that inertia is the negative influence of an organization’s age on its structures and practices, especially when facing external or environmental threats or uncertainties. Structural inertia, which increases monotonically with age, is an organization’s inability to perform internal changes in light of significant external changes (Hannan & Freeman, 1977, 1984). An incumbent firm may not be adaptable due to its inertia. In a dynamic market, a business needs to be agile and flexible to environmental or technological changes. It needs to be able to change its routines to cope and deal with risks and uncertainties and to seize opportunities. This is more difficult for older franchises because of rigidity in organizational routines.        Moreover, by closely examining franchising literature, there are also studies on ownership redirection, which show that successful franchised outlets are acquired by the franchisor as the franchise ages. Ownership redirection is based on resource dependence (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) and resource–scarcity theories. Many franchisors start franchising because of their need for informational, managerial, and financial resources (Dant & Kaufmann, 2003). Franchisees have local market knowledge that franchisors need in order to expand. Also, the several fees and royalties that franchisees pay provide financial resources to the franchisors. Thus, the longer the franchise has been doing business, the more established they become, and the more that they accumulate (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1968). Consequently, franchisors become less reliant and dependent on franchisees and their resources. According to ownership redirection theory, which was first proposed by Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1968), it is more likely for successful franchised units to be acquired by the franchisor or that the franchisor will shift to a bigger proportion of company-owned outlets. Carney and Gedajlovic (1991) argue that as the franchise grows over time, franchisors learn the potential of individual units in terms of sales and profit, and they will exercise their option to repurchase these units after the expiration of their contracts. Hypotheses Communication of risk and the number of new franchised outlets Risk is defined in the Cambridge dictionary (2018) as “danger, or the possibility of danger, defeat, or loss.” In an investment context, it means the possibility of losing some or all of a potential investment. One of the reasons franchisees choose franchising is to mitigate the risks associated with owning their own independent businesses. Franchising provides risk-sharing opportunities between the franchisor and the franchisee and, thus, is preferred by entrepreneurs who are risk-averse (Williams, 1999). Studies show that entrepreneurs are more likely to resort to the organization form of franchising when industry risks are high (Williams, 1999). As potential franchisees resort to franchising to reduce risks, they will be thus less likely to choose a risky franchise.          In addition, given the substantial costs that will be incurred by franchisees and considering that their investment of buying a franchise is an undiversified investment, potential franchisees tend to be risk-averse. Furthermore, risk means danger and uncertainty because there is a possible failure hazard. Considering the investment, time, and effort the franchisees put in their franchised units, they will avoid risky franchises due to concerns about potential failure and the inability to continue the businesses. Therefore, we hypothesize that greater communication of risk will discourage potential franchisees from buying into the franchise system, thus affecting the number of new franchised outlets. Hypothesis 1: The greater the franchisor communicates on risk, the lower the number of new franchised outlets. Communication of returns and the number of new franchised outlets There is no doubt that when people invest in something, they expect to generate gains on their investments. Entrepreneurs choose franchising over owning an independent business to maximize their wealth (Williams, 1999). In addition, franchisees must pay continuous fees and royalties, which diminish their investment returns. Therefore, franchisees would prefer that franchises offer guaranteed returns to keep their units running and profitable. One might propose that the more benefits and returns the franchisors demonstrate, the more value the potential franchisees will see, leading them to view the franchise favorably. Thus, we hypothesize that as franchisors communicate more on the returns of investing in the franchise system, this will make the system attractive to potential franchisees. Thus, communication of returns by franchisors will positively affect the number of new franchised outlets. Hypothesis 2: The greater the franchisor communicates on returns, the higher the number of new franchised stores. Franchise age and the number new franchised outlets The age of the franchise can provide a number of signals to franchisees. Given that the potential franchisees have many different franchises to choose from, they will critically evaluate their options. Of course, franchisees will choose franchises that have proven business formulas and with successful units that are already running, but these qualities do not necessarily mean that the franchises are older. Considering that there are factors other than age that can prove the success and reliability of the franchise (such as the sales of current units), franchisees will more likely consider the negative, hidden implications of a franchise’s age—inertia and possible ownership redirection, as previously explored—rather than positive ones. In addition, it has been demonstrated that older franchises have a higher risk of failure (Bordonaba-Juste, Lucia-Palacios, & Polo-Redondo, 2011). Thus, age is expected to have a negative influence on the decisions of franchisees. It is therefore hypothesized that the older the franchise, the lower the number of newly–opened franchised outlets. Hypothesis 3: The greater the franchisor’s age, the lower the number of new franchised stores. Risk, franchise age, and the number of new franchised outlets As indicated previously, franchisees choose franchising to reduce the risks and uncertainties that usually come with starting their own independent businesses. Coupled with risk, potential franchisees will view the age of the franchise as an increased risk due to concerns of organizational inertia and rigidity. Namely, since inertia increases with age, as the franchise gets older, it will lack the adaptation and flexibility to handle these risks (Hannan & Freeman, 1984). Hence, it is proposed that as age increases, the negative influence of communication of risk on the opening of new franchised outlets will be strengthened. Hypothesis 4: The age of the franchise strengthens the negative relationship between risk and number of new franchised outlets. Return, franchise age and the number of new franchised outlets The main input of franchisors’ supply is the originality and creative ability that allows them to create branded products (Williams, 1999). Inertial forces, however, could hinder franchises’ creativity and innovation as they age. The speed of technological innovations and competition requires organizations to be highly adaptable and quick in their responses. However, age has a negative effect on organizations’ rate of change due to structural inertia (Hannan & Freeman, 1984). Subsequently, older organizations adapt more slowly to opportunities in the environment. Le Mens, Hannan, and Pólos (2014) maintain that environmental changes, specifically the drift in audiences’ tastes, increases failure hazards for older organizations due to their inertia and inability to adapt to new trends. Franchises that do not adapt quickly will lose their competitive advantage and miss out on opportunities that may increase their returns. Moreover, inert franchises could still be investing greatly in response to technological and environmental changes with no real returns because of what is called active inertia. Sull (1999) defines active inertia as “an organization's tendency to persist in the activities that contributed to its past success despite even the most dramatic changes in its competitive environment” (p. 459–460). In other words, these organizations are stuck to old habits and routines, and they fail to respond to changes effectively. Thus,  Hypothesis 5: The age of the franchise weakens the positive relationship between return and number of new franchised outlets. The conceptual framework of the research is presented in Figure 1. METHODOLOGY Research design  The purpose of this research is to investigate how franchisors’ communication of risk and return affects the franchisors’ ability to increase new franchised outlets. To test the research hypotheses, we collect data using the FDDs. Baucus et al. (1993) state that potential franchisees use disclosure documents to choose a franchise from a “menu of franchise opportunities” (p. 2). Disclosure documents have an ample amount of information that can be used for investigating and analyzing issues related to franchising.           An FDD contains detailed information about the franchisor and the franchise system. It organizes 23 items, such as information about the franchisor’s involvement in litigation, sections for initial fees (among others), the franchisor’s and franchisee’s obligations, the franchisee’s rights and restrictions, list of franchise outlets, and contracts.         FDDs are specifically intended for potential franchisees. Although other means of communication, like the business’s website, provides information (Zachary et al., 2011), potential franchisees are closer to making decisions when they examine the FDD. Thus, FDDs and item 1, in particular, can be critical tools for investigating the influence of franchisors’ communications on increasing the new openings of franchised outlets. Item 1 of the FDD provides information—description of the business, market, brand’s name, purpose, products/services, and how long the franchise has been in business. This information is used to understand the business, to gain initial insight into the business’s reliability, and to determine whether it (the business) provides more benefits than risks. Hence, item 1 of the FDD is used for content analysis by examining the impact of risk and returns language on the attractiveness of the franchise outlets.  Sample The FDDs were collected from state regulatory authorities in the United States. Franchises for which two consecutive years of FDDs were available in the state regulatory authorities’ website were included. A convenient sample of 133 franchises was identified. The registered franchises and their FDDs are updated periodically. Most of the registered franchises only had one FDD available in one year; once it expires, the FDD is usually removed and replaced with an updated one. In addition, there are variations between the expiry date of FDDs and their replacements from franchise to franchise, making it more difficult to collect two consecutive years of FDDs at one time. Hence, franchises that made available two years of FDDs were included in the sample. In addition, the data collection period spanned a few months to increase the opportunity of obtaining two consecutive years of FDDs, as franchisors updated their FDDs. FDDs from two consecutive years were used for collecting data within the period 2016–2018. This means that a total of 266 FDDs were collected to ensure that communication of risk and return affect new franchised outlets in the subsequent period.       The data collected from the FDDs included: item 1 content, initial investment, royalty rates, current numbers of franchisee and company-owned stores, and the year the business started franchising. From the subsequent year FDDs, information on new franchise outlets was collected to measure the dependent variable. Examining these variables across two years allows the testing of the research hypotheses about the influence of franchisors’ communications on subsequent years’ new franchised outlets. Content analysis of the FDD  To create the measures of the communication of risk and return, content analysis is employed. Krippendorff (2004) defines content analysis as “a research technique for making replicable and valid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their use” (p.19). Content analysis is the best tool for examining how franchisors communicate with potential franchisees. Content analysis is a more effective and efficient way of collecting and analyzing an abundant amount of information. This is especially feasible with the use of computer-aided text analysis which in this case is LIWC 2015 software (Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, & Blackburn, 2015).         Content analysis techniques are used in a number of research fields, such as journalism, political science, finance, and social psychology. Also, many areas in the marketing field—consumer research (Kassarjian 1977; Sridhar & Srinivasan, 2012) and advertising (Gross & Sheth, 1989)—have used content analysis. However, its use in franchising research is scarce except when used as a complementing method (Boulay & Stan, 2013; Gauzente, 2002), and it was used in a study that explored franchise branding by examining the rhetoric of the corporate websites (Zachary et al., 2011).           LIWC was chosen for its ability to analyze large amounts of data rapidly. In addition, the software exports quantitative results to Excel so that they can be used in statistical analysis right away. Studies have proven its validity as a measure (Kahn, Tobin, Massey, & Anderson, 2007), and LIWC has been used in both marketing (Berger, & Milkman, 2012; Hewett, Rand, Rust, & van Heerde, 2016; Sridhar & Srinivasan, 2012) and other research fields (Niederhoffer & Pennebaker, 2009). Measures All measures, apart from the dependent variable, are taken from FDDs in time Dependent variable New franchised outlets are measured by the number of newly–opened franchisee outlets in year . Considering the purpose of the study, which is to test the temporal effect of franchisors’ communication on increasing the openings of franchised outlets, new franchised outlets will be a direct measure to test the effect. This is because, unlike growth rate, it ignores termination, non-renewal, or transfer of franchised outlets to company-owned as they not of interest in the current study. Independent variables Communication of risk is measured using the risk variable from the LIWC software. The software calculates the percentage of words for each construct from the total word count by comparing the words in the text to built-in dictionaries. The higher the use of risk–associated words, like danger and doubt, the higher the risk percentage will be (Pennebaker et al., 2015).      Communication of return is measured by the reward variable from the LIWC software. Similar to the risk variable, a high percentage for reward means the high usage of reward–associated words, such as benefits and prize (Pennebaker et al., 2015).        The moderator franchise age is measured as the difference between the calendar year t and the year the franchisor started offering franchising opportunities to franchisees. This data is provided in the FDDs. Control variables We control for various factors that could affect the franchisees’ decision to invest in a system and therefore affect the new franchised outlets.  Royalty rate is important for new franchisees and has an effect on the attractiveness of the franchise and ultimately the franchisees’ decision to buy it (Grünhagen & Dorsch, 2003). Franchisees may also use it to estimate what their expected costs are in the future. Royalty rate is calculated as a percentage of sales.  Initial investment, is controlled as being one of the factors that have a great influence on the franchise system’s size (Shane et al., 2006). It is measured by taking the average of the highest and lowest estimated initial investments required from the franchisee to open a single unit.        Companyowned outlets are used by the franchisors to signal the success of the business idea to prospective franchisees (Mani et al., 2016), company-owned outlets is measured as the number of company-owned outlets in year      Franchised outlets variable is measured as the number of franchised outlets in year t-1. We control for franchised outlets in year  because we expect that it could have a meaningful impact on the number of franchised outlets in year . These effects could be potential concerns for franchisees of encroachment issues and intra-brand competition (Kalnins, 2004). It also signals the desirability and demand for the franchises’ offerings. A semi-log transformation of franchised outlets was used to reduce skewness. Moreover, franchising is expected to be lower for franchises that already have a high proportion of franchised outlets (Sen, 1998).         Word count is the total number of words in the text, and it is controlled due to the possibility that some franchisees might use peripheral cues to evaluate franchisors’ communication. Franchisees might interpret the length of the text as a heuristic of a better message that has greater justifications to choose the franchise. In some cases, the recipients of a message use heuristic processing strategies (Chaiken, 1980). A study on the role of message attributes in persuasion found that message recipients who had little attitude–relevant information in memory (such as prior experiences) to draw upon when evaluating the arguments in a message were persuaded by superficial cues, such as the length of the message (Wood, Kallgren, & Preisler, 1985).  The descriptive statistics and correlations for all the variables are presented in table 1 and table 2, respectively. DATA ANALYSIS To test the hypotheses, Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis was conducted with the new franchised outlets in year (NFO) for franchise brand , as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables, which are all in year , refer to the amount of risk and return communicated by the franchisor in year t-1 (RISKit-1, RETURNit-1), franchise age (FrAGE), number of franchised outlets and company–owned outlets in year  (FOUTLETSit-1 and COUTLETSit-1, respectively), initial investment (IINVESTit-1), royalty rate (RRit-1), and word count (WCit-1). All independent variables were mean-centered for use in analyses to reduce multicollinearity. The interaction terms with FrAGEit-1 (RISKit-1 *FrAGEit-1, RETURNit-1*FrAGEit-1) are also included. Consequently, we estimate the following regression equation:  = β0 + β1 RISKit-1 + β2 RETURNit-1 + β3 FrAGEit-1 + β4 (RISKit-1 *FrAGEit-1+ β5 (RETURNit-1 *FrAGEit-1) + β6 FOUTLETSit-1 + β7 COUTLETSit-1 + β8 IINVESTit-1 + β9 RRit-1 + β10 WCit-1 + ε Results Table 3 contains the results of OLS regression analysis for Model 1 (without the moderator and interaction terms), Model 2 (with the moderator only) and Model 3 (with moderator and interaction terms). In H, we predicted that the more the franchisor communicates on risk in the lower the number of new franchised outlets in . The findings show that franchisors’ risk communication is negatively associated with the number of new franchised outlets (18.22, <.05). Therefore, His supported. Hexpects that the more the franchisor communicates on return in the higher the number of new franchised outlets in However, the results indicate that there is no significant effect of franchisors’ communication of returns on the number of new franchised outlets (-3.23, n.s.). Thus, His not supported. As predicted in H, there is a significant negative relationship between franchise age and openings of new franchised outlets (-0.67, <.05). The results therefore, support HThe coefficient of the interaction term between franchise age and risk on the opening of new franchised outlets is significant (-1.8, < .05); therefore, supporting H. However, there was no support for Hwhich predicted a stronger positive effect of communication of return on the number of new franchised outlets as the franchise gets older (.02, n.s.). As such, His not supported. For the control variables, we find that the number of franchised outlets in year  (β6= 8.10, p< .001) significantly and positively affect the number of new franchised outlets in year Royalty rate (β9= -2.52, p< .05) significantly and negatively affects the number of new franchised outlets. Also, word count (β10= 0.004, p< .05) is significantly and positively associated with the number of new franchised outlets. However, the number of company-owned outlets and average investment in t-1 does not significantly affect the number of new franchised outlets in Post hoc analysis of risk communication and age interaction For a better understanding, we provide a graphical representation of the interaction of riskt-1 and franchise aget-1 (Figure 2). We conducted a simple slope analysis to examine the significant effects in the interaction between riskt-1 and franchise aget-1 (Aiken and West 1991). We assessed the effects of franchise age at the mean +/− 1 standard deviation to represent high and low levels of age. As demonstrated in Figure 2, in the presence of low franchise age, risk had no effect on the number of new franchised outlets (-92.96, n.s.). For high franchise age, risk decreased the number of new franchised outlets (-118.49, p< .05). DISCUSSION Theoretical implication We find evidence in support of the role played by franchisors’ communication on new franchised outlets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has content analyzed the communication of risk and returns by franchisors and its influence on new franchised outlets. Our findings on the effect of the communication of risk contribute to the literature on the strategic use of rhetoric. It has been argued that if franchisees were rewarded with higher expected returns, they would be willing to accept higher risks (Martin, 1988). Yet, the findings of this study reveal that franchisees place emphasis on the communication of risk but not that of returns. The findings suggest that potential losses exert a greater impact on prospective franchisees than potential gains. This is consistent with prospect theory’s notion that “losses loom larger than gains” (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p.279) and that people’s discontent with losing is more prevalent than the pleasure they might get by gaining the same amount. This study’s analysis of the franchisor’s communication illuminates the possible influences on a potential franchisee’s decision–making process. Studies on how franchisees decide on and select a franchise will provide franchisors with insights on how to increase the system size. Yet, there is still a gap in franchising literature on what makes franchisees select a particular franchise. Most franchise selection studies were focused on franchisors’ selection of franchisees (Jambulingham & Nevin, 1999; Clarkin & Swavely, 2006, Wang & Altinay; 2008, Altinay & Okumus, 2010). Contributing to the franchisee–selection literature, the results of this study reveal that high communication of risk reduces the favorability of the franchise to potential franchisees, as evidenced by lower new franchised outlets.          Moreover, the findings of the influence of age will contribute to answering a part of franchise growth’s fundamental unanswered questions that (Mani et al., 2016) identified in their review. The finding of franchisor’s age on openings new franchised outlets was contrary to prior findings that longevity of the franchise is valued by franchisees (Baucus et al. 1993). The findings reveal that franchises’ age has a negative influence on franchisees’ decision to buy a franchise. There are several possible explanations for this result. Firstly, as the franchises get older, it is more likely that they have achieved or are close to achieving their expansion goals. This means that these franchises reached saturation, and thus they have decreased or stopped their expansion efforts. Secondly, as mentioned in the literature review, the probability of ownership redirection is increased for older, mature franchises (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1968). This means that ownership redirection could either be a possible concern by potential franchisees in older franchises or that the franchisors themselves are not looking to expand anymore.          This study also finds that the franchises’ age moderates the relationship between risk and the opening of new franchised outlets. This can be explained by structural inertia (Hannan & Freeman, 1984) that old organizations tend to develop. When older franchisors’ communication contains high levels of risk, the potential franchisees may deduce that this franchise could be incapable of adapting with these risks due to inertia. A thorough search of the relevant literature yielded only one related article in franchising (Winter, Szulanski, Ringov & Jensen, 2012), where structural inertia theory was partially employed. However, instead of examining the whole franchise, Winter et al. (2012) examined franchised outlets and how accurate replication versus local adaptation influences their survival. In addition, their data set only included franchised outlets with a maximum of 11 years old. This study, in contrast, has a sample that varied in age from one to 62, allowing for more insights on the effects of franchise age. Managerial implication The findings of this study offer several implications for franchisors. To develop effective communication strategies to interact with prospective franchisees, one must understand what factors influence a franchisee’s decision–making process when buying a franchise. The study reveals how franchisors’ word their communication to potential franchisees with respect to risk can negatively influence the decision of whether or not to buy the franchise. The negative relationship between risk and the openings of new franchised outlets worsens as the franchise gets older. Hence, these implications follow.         First, franchisors must carefully think about their communication, as it could greatly influence the decisions of prospective franchisees. To persuade a potential franchisee, value must be conveyed; franchisees incur substantial financial costs when investing in franchising and will try to avoid risky businesses. In addition, failure to pay enough attention to how franchisors communicate to prospective franchisees could undermine their prior efforts to attract franchisees up to reading the franchisor’s communication. While it is not recommended that franchisors be less candid and transparent than they were before to potential franchisees, franchisors should word their communication in a more assuring way by focusing on the benefits of the franchise to encourage potential franchisees. The following text is from one of the highest risk words communicating franchisors and as can be seen it is communicating on risk in a considerable frequency:   “There are no guarantees of your success as there exist both typical and special business risk factors including: changing market conditions; competition; cost of supplies, equipment, real estate and improvements, capital and labor; your own health and continuity of your management; continuation of sources of supply; quality and availability of labor; availability of financing; recession or depression locally, nationally, or internationally; wars; strikes; emergencies; natural and man-made disasters; litigation; and liability and casualty losses. Risks of the business include industry and market developments, such as pricing policies of competitors, and supply and demand”         Second, older franchises should provide more incentives to neutralize the risk associated with age. If the franchisors are communicating real risks, then they should emphasize the advantages of mature organizations. For instance, reputation, reliability, brand name, and stability should all be stressed along with the risk associated with the franchise. Another possible way to alleviate the influence of risk on potential the decisions of franchisees is by communicating franchisors’ efforts to mitigate future risks and uncertainties. Limitations and future research The findings should be placed in the context of several limitations that we hope to be regarded as opportunities for further research. First, the data is obtained from the US market so it may not generalize to other markets. Some studies suggest cross-cultural differences in the proportion of company-owned versus franchised outlets between countries. A study by Perrigot, and Cliquet (2008) found that compared to US franchises, Brazil’s and France’s franchises have almost triple the number of company-owned outlets. Further studies could explore the generalizability of this study’s findings to other countries.         Moreover, prior research also suggests that there are variations between industries and their investment requirements, risks, and dual distribution structure. The type of constraints that franchisors face in each industry also influence the degree of franchising they require to expand. In some industries, for instance, there is a higher preference for company-owned outlets like the restaurants’ sector (Dant et al., 2008), while hotels show less dual distribution (Kalnins, 2004). In addition, some industries may have higher innate risks, while others may have lower risks. Dant, Paswan, and Kaufmann (1996) stress the importance of industry-specific differences between franchise systems, and they encourage considering them in the analysis. Unfortunately, the classification of industries and possible variance in results between different franchise industries were not considered in this study due to the small sample size. Thus, more research is needed to validate the findings while considering industry differences.        Another limitation due to data availability constraints is using two consecutive years only while it would have been ideal to include data of more than two consecutive years to test the hypotheses. In addition, including data of multiple years in future studies will contribute to a deeper understanding of unit growth as a whole throughout a number of years.       Additionally, most researches that considered franchisees’ perspective interviewed or surveyed current franchisees. Future studies could examine the views of potential franchisees instead of current ones to gain deeper insights into their motives and factors that they consider while looking for a franchise to buy. Franchisees’ perception of the risk and return of franchises can be examined using surveys while also investigating the influence of any prior business experience on their level of risk tolerance.

      "The Impact of Ownership: Exploratory Case Studies in  Governance of Franchise Retail Organizations Martin Ludvigsson-Wallette PhD Candidate Linnaeus University School of Business and Economics 351 95 VÄXJÖ Sweden +46 (0)72 700 12 18 martin.ludvigsson-wallette@lnu.se Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School May 25-26, 2021 The Impact of Ownership: Exploratory Case Studies in Governance of Franchise Retail Organizations Abstract This explorative case study examines the effect of different ownership structures and corporate governance models on business operations at four franchise retail organizations. Corporate governance is defined broadly as the system of laws, rules, and factors that control operations at a company. Much of the previous research on hybrid organizations, which exist between markets and hierarchies such as franchise organizations, largely ignores corporate governance. Previous research has focused mainly on franchisee-franchisor channel governance. This study utilizes qualitative explorative interviews to explore franchise firms’ ownership structures and resultant governance dynamics. All four case companies in this study share an appreciation of the low-cost, low-investment model of franchising with a contractual base. This paper finds that a fair and balanced approach to all stakeholders with regard to governance capabilities is needed for retailers to remain relevant and competitive. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study in the retailing literature to focus on corporate governance and ownership in franchising platforms and contribute a typology of ownership models in franchising.Keywords: Franchising, Governance, Ownership, Retailing, Business modelThe Impact of Ownership: Exploratory Case Studies in Governance of Franchise Retail Organizations Introduction  Franchising has become an increasingly popular business model in recent decades (Dant, Grünhagen, and Windsperger 2011; Combs and Ketchen 2003; Holmstrom 1999), spurring extensive research on the franchisee-franchisor relationship (Hsu, Kaufmann, and Srinivasan 2017; Hendrikse and Jiang 2011; Argyres and Liebeskind 1999). At the same time, scholarly work has largely neglected the higher-order governance relationships that exist in the franchising model (Massimino and Lawrence 2019). These overlooked relationships include those between governing boards and management, as well as those between management and owner/operators such as franchisees (von Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, and Nilsson 2020; Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020). As a result, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the role and influence of the governance process and mechanics in these franchise companies. This paper seeks to address this gap by focusing on governance in the retail sector, where business models such as franchising help retailers grow. Though some studies have examined the process of organizational change within franchising more generally (Bradach 1997), we lack knowledge on how different franchise companies are structured with different ownership models but use the same business model and franchising strategy of multi-level ownership. For this research, we chose an explorative qualitative case study approach (R. Yin 2003; Seawright and Gerring 2008) because research on franchise governance is still emerging. With this qualitative, multiple-case study methodology, we offer an overview of how the different ownership structures at four companies influence governance of the business. In doing so, we answer the call for exploring an expanded view of external financing in franchise governance (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020). By applying an expanded, higher-order view (see Figure 1 in C, D, E) of the external impact on the franchising system, we attempt to merge the previously isolated perspectives of corporate governance and franchising to explore if and how the former can drive and transform the latter.  In this case-study, we broadly define corporate governance as the system of laws, rules, and factors that control operations at a company (Gillan and Starks 1998). Franchise operations entail important decisions including ownership, control systems, training, and allocation of resources, communication, and advertising via co-ops. Wide variance exists in the governance of this hybrid organizational form, a factor that remains little understood (Combs and Ketchen 2003). Changes at the higher ownership level are nonetheless consequential, impacting unit-level performance and influencing franchisee-franchisor relations (Bernstein and Sheen 2016; Lawrence and Kaufmann 2011). Given these factors, our primary research question is this: How can the significant variety of corporate governance structures in franchising contribute to our understanding of corporate governance?  This article is structured as follows: First, we present an emerging framework of franchise governance (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020). Second, we present our research design and fieldwork. Next, we detail our empirical findings and discuss their implications. Finally, we provide directions for future research. Theory in Governance of Franchising  Theoretical frameworks adopted in the field of governance in franchising  Traditional areas of corporate governance have widened beyond boards and compensation to include the role of owners and equity market owners (Jansson, Jonnergård, and Larsson Olaison 2013). This expanded view is rooted in the notion of property rights, or behavioral relations among decision makers for the use of potentially valuable resources (Ostrom 1990). The theory of property rights posits that different people can function as barriers to particular aspects of a single resource (Barzel 1997).  To be able to move forward in the fields of franchise and governance research, we must reflect on the progression of franchising research. The first theory of ownership in this field is the ownership redirection thesis by Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1968), which posits that franchising companies are heading in the direction either of entirely franchised systems or completely company-owned systems. Harrigan (1984) later challenged this thesis with the stable plural forms thesis, specifically the notion of tapered integration. The stable plural forms thesis argues that each type of ownership structure offers a distinctive governance benefit, thus franchise companies continue to invest in company-owned and franchised operations. The stable plural forms thesis further argues that plural form organizations likely are the ideal choice for efficiency-committed companies. Building on this important research in franchise governance could allow us to better understand which theory is more likely in practice, considering the limited empirical evidence supporting the stable plural forms thesis (Lafontaine and Kaufmann 1994; Baker and Dant 2008).  Figure 1. Conceptual model framework of analysis Our research is founded on an expanded model of external financing contracts in a franchising system, wherein the corporate governance structure grows even more complex (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020), as illustrated with the Figure 1 in areas C, D, and E. Area C represents equity owners’ and debt holders’ external governance of the franchisor. External governance in Area D represents equity and debt holders of franchisees, which are independent entities with their own balance sheets and ownership structures. Area E represents other external stakeholders that do not have to engage directly in an economic exchange with the franchise firm (e.g., franchisee associations, suppliers, customers, media, auditors, communities, politics, laws, and regulations). The semi-internal, franchise organization on the internal governance side of Figure 1 holds the franchise right to operations for a limited time (Area B). Figure 1 shows how debt, or creditors such as banks, can govern by applying different covenants/credit ratings, while equity, or investors, can govern through the board of directors (Area A), adding complexity to the corporate governance structures of franchising. Methodology and Fieldwork Method  Case studies allow the researcher to examine previously unexplored, emerging phenomena (Eisenhardt 1989) and gather rich, empirical descriptions of particular instances of a phenomenon (R. K. Yin 1994; Eisenhardt and Graebner 2007). We chose the qualitative case study approach for this context because the field of franchise governance is still emerging, while research on the implications and impact of governance in retail franchising is limited. Qualitative case study methodologies, moreover, are necessary when studying complex research areas (Creswell and Clark 2018) where only limited previous academic research and theory exist.  Data collection Data collection began with multiple sources, creating a base of information to support our findings (R. Yin 2003). The main secondary, publicly available data included annual reports, analyst reports, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, prior academic articles, books, business press articles, and other industry reports on the case companies, as well the franchise companies’ websites and direct observations. These secondary data allowed us to form a rich picture of the businesses throughout their history. One way to ensure trustworthiness of the data is to make what Lincoln and Guba (1990) call “member checks” with respondents, or confirming that the developing interpretations make sense to them. Respondents validated the events and our interpretation when contacted. This technique, combined with secondary data collection and a chain of evidence, was used to triangulate the data, interviews, and observations in order to.  gain more understanding of the events. Because case studies typically are based on a variety of data sources (R. K. Yin 1994), we also gathered information from multiple sources to corroborate the same fact or phenomenon, as suggested by Patton (2002). In addition to the interviews and direct observations in corporate offices, findings from earlier reviews and conceptual studies in the franchising literature (Dant, Grünhagen, and Windsperger 2011; Nijmeijer, Fabbricotti, and Huijsman 2014; von Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, and Nilsson 2020; Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020) seek to bring clarity and help triangulate a robust case study. To make the case studies’ empirical descriptions as rich as possible, these secondary data allowed us to form a rich picture of the businesses throughout the four case companies.  Fieldwork method A uniform, semi-structured interview agenda was custom made for this multiple-case study (see Appendix A), with questions drawn from conceptual work and from findings in an earlier structural review study (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020; von Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, and Nilsson 2020). We divided the areas of inquiry into four areas: corporate governance situations in accordance with the traditional view of corporate governance, governance challenges unique to franchising, governance modes, and contracts. To identify the key components of the governance in franchising for comparison, we selected case companies with varied ownership structures (George et al. 2005; Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020).  We decided to focus on large multinational enterprises (MNE) with a global presence and sales volume between $3.5 billion and $40 billion annually, which we take as an indication of the franchised business model’s success.  Multiple Cases and Analysis Multiple cases allow for broader investigation of research questions and theoretical expansion. As Eisenhardt and Graebner (2007) note, a few additional cases added to an initially small count can significantly affect the quality of the evolving theory. For example, adding three cases to a case study is modest in terms of numbers, but offers four times the analytic power (R. Yin 2003). Therefore, theory building from multiple cases usually yields stronger and more generalizable theory, in addition to research in theory testing. A multiple–case study design has no rules regarding how many  cases are required to satisfy replication requirements.  The case study was analysed similarly to the question-and answer format approach followed by R. Yin (2003), where complementary secondary data sources are used to gain an in-depth understanding of multi-level ownership in franchising platforms and their business models. Similarly to that approach, this paper focuses on the processes that lead to the capturing of value, how firms use owners in their governance models, and how that model affects the business. Data analysis followed a three-step process from data analysis to interpretation that is common in case study research (R. Yin 2003). First, we aggregated the data from each company, interpreting common patterns and differences. Second, we combined, sorted, and linked the data from the four cases. We then organized the data according to the question-and-answer framework (R. Yin 2003) in order to identify the value propositions. Case study evidence does not require the traditional presentation form; instead, we applied an alternative question-and-answer form (R. Yin 2003), taking each answer that contains all the relevant evidence and strengthening it with citations.  The four companies in this study are multinational retailers with a number of key differences but they all have in common the use of the franchising business model. Table 1 presents descriptive data on these four case companies. Table 1. Results  We present our results in the order of the research questions posed. In establishing the purpose of the meeting, the author clearly communicated to respondents that he was examining corporate governance forms and writing a case paper focusing on different franchising ownership models. What follows are the narrativized question-and-answer sessions of the  semi-structured interview protocols. Research Question 1 - Owners Company 1 – Cooperative owned The first research question entailed determining how owners affect the franchising system (see Appendix for full questioner protocol). For Company 1, we specifically asked: How does the cooperative owner affect governance in the franchise system. This question solicited a long pause and the response: “Next, question please.” The CEO then stated:  In the beginning we were independent and in our firm, there is no natural one part like other chains down the street. The structure of the resources is the opposite other firms and the owners; the members do not drive the firm to grant them to run stores.

The Company 1 owner also has never fully examined whether franchising is generally more economically profitable. As a result, Company 1 does not have a complete franchise model for franchisees because it does not own the store, warehouse, or inventory. Company 1 is like a cleaning company where operators come in with their staff and run the store. A key challenge for Company 1 remains at the political level: How does the company incorporate a franchise model into a cooperative model and maintain this model’s economic cycle?The member companies within Company 1 use the business form of franchisees and in the future, the structure of regional cooperatives could perhaps act as a franchise agent. As the CEO noted: “If the arrangement of our governance structure would change and collect royalties in a different way, we would be more efficient and profitable.” A thin line separates a cooperative franchise and a federation aggregate with member organizations, not individuals. As a Company 1 executive states: “Franchise main strategy is a motivational management tool without a purpose. The firm has then built up governance structures we cannot break out of and then continue mostly per tradition and culture.” Worth noting is the difference between controlling franchisees versus employees, a challenge when a “family” feel is desired more than that of an investment firm. Company 1 has a majority owner with a 37% stake, as well as associations encompassing approximately 3.5 million individual owners who have one vote each. Some wealthy associations have assumed direct ownership in the operating company. As a franchise strategy, Company 1 is franchising the worst-performing stores in hopes of a turnaround. An interesting example of the franchise reinvestment strategy occurs with store reimaging, a financial burden the franchisee bears only in part. Company 1 has not found any other ways to roll out a chain-wide reimaging initiative without using a corporate cash-intensive push strategy.  Company 2 – Foundation owned Because a foundation, not an individual, owns Company 2, the organization is, in theory, owner-less. How, then, does Company 2’s foundation owner affect the franchise system?  The previous owner of Company 2 was involved in the setup of the entire structure. The franchisor is one company, the owner of which is a foundation that gives an exclusive assignment to the franchisor to develop all products for franchisees. Sales and food service operations include a supply company that buys up products and distributes them to franchisees. One very large franchisee represents 90% of the units and also is a foundation. Other franchisees are large companies with other diverse businesses in their respective countries. One of the franchisees is a family firm that was instrumental in creating value for the original owner when the transfer into foundation status occurred. For the original owner, it was important to maintain its core values and concepts and not become publicly traded. This is driven further by the values of the many people who have grown up working in the firm. In one respect, the original owner did not receive anything for his creation. The franchise governance solution, however, created a family-owned bank that served franchisees and itself became a franchisee to the foundation. Company 2 also diversified idiosyncratic risk by letting in other franchisees as an alternative to the public markets but balancing this growth with more governance. The owner in Company 2 decides and grants franchise rights for a whole country, then the franchisee commits to a market penetration plan. The firm now has three different sizes of stores as a function of these franchisees. The franchisor contracts for at least 10 years and the franchisee pays a 3% royalty fee on revenue instead of an up-front fee. The idea of risk diversification without going public creates a franchise organization that steers the company in alignment with the values of Company 2. When one part of the sister company becomes a franchisee, they know store-level profit dynamics and can benchmark and understand their business partners from a franchisee point of view. Some unique governance issues do arise when the franchisor is a franchisee but not in the same legal structure. Company 2 aspires to manage this issue with a legal, operational, and communicative structure. Supervisory boards lead these three structures and alignment takes time, resulting in a sluggish organization. Given the unique ownership structure of Company 2, its founding family appoints members of the board at the highest level of the organization. Company 3 – Private Family owned In a family-owned firm like Company 3, how does the owner affect the franchise system? Company 3 wants to own as much of the supply chain as possible and has used the franchising model for 10 years while establishing a presence in countries in the Middle East. In Company 3, the owners are very involved in laying the groundwork for a franchise partnership decision. As such, it is very important to Company 3 that employees are aligned with its values and want to work closely with the franchisor. Company 3 also exerts control through rigid contracts with reconciliations and demands. Its board of directors decides whether and with whom to collaborate and is very involved in managing the franchise model. Company 3 operates in 10 countries in the Middle East and has an investment firm partner for the rest of Asia.  Interestingly, many partner franchisees are also large family firms. Franchising for Company 3 is about the risk of sharing and knowledge in negotiating locations; certain brands may not be included in the franchisee portfolios due to potential conflicts of interest. The franchisors’ focus is to be the most important brand to the client. With its franchisee partners, the CEO of Company 3 said the goal is that they become “like a part of us,” adding that “when you mention ‘us and them,’ it is an error. It is just ‘we,’ together. We have franchise partners but with family-valued partnerships.” This message signals that Company 3 is seeking a perfect match. The common denominator from an ownership standpoint is family values. Many of Company 3’s competitors, by contrast, are more financially focused in selecting partnerships and pursuing other business models.  Company 3 has one majority owner and many minority owners. Given ownership’s intense focus on values alignment, these minority shareholders appear to have a disconnect in purpose regarding why they hold shares. Specifically, the majority owner has an “ownership forever” mindset and considers the minority owners focused on the short term. This appears to create an “ownership disconnect” for the firm.  For Company 3, its business model represents what one executive called a “ridiculously profitable franchise solution.” Company 3 understands the risk assumed in controlling the brand, a responsibility that encompasses managing how it is both perceived and handled. Overall, Company 3 states that its long-term focus is to control by values as opposed to by governance.  Company 4 – Publicly owned How does a publicly traded franchise owner (Company 4) affect its franchise system? Our meeting with Company 4 began with a clear answer: The owners are the investors that own the stock, while long holders are mutual funds, hedge funds, and other asset managers. From a governance perspective, one executive stated: The owners affect the franchise system because the investors like our business and invest in our business because of our franchise system, but also because they like the franchising model we have, with the lower cost of capital, risk/reward, and entrepreneurs that run the business. The franchisor-owning investors do not interact with the franchisees and the franchisor does not provide much direct access to them. Globally, Company 4 has 94% franchised businesses. As one executive stated: “Franchisees are the most important to our business. How successful they are is a direct impact to our businesses.” The ratio of franchised versus company-owned stores appears to have been decided after discussions with the largest owners—relatively speaking, as these owners control no more than 5% of outstanding shares—who are interested primarily in cash return. The shareholder owners understand how important franchisees’ success is to the business and how valuable franchise system-franchisee relationships are. When Company 4 decides the dividend and cash return, they discuss the matter with investors and large owners. From a governance perspective, Company 4’s CFO frames the capital allocation strategy as: What is the right amount to put into the business? The dividend payout ratio is 60% right now, so we generate a lot of cash. The first use of capital is reinvestment in the business, and second option is dividend. The allocation of capital to the dividend is a board decision. The franchisees are not members of the board and are mostly interested in the reinvestment of generated cash in the business again. This could lead to a conflict of interest.  Company 4’s executive management goes to the board with recommendations on fund allocations to investors through dividends and franchise business reinvestment. Some franchisees think they should be on the board but Company 4 does not agree, though it does invite franchisees to present to the board. As one board member stated, “[Franchisees] sometimes will be in direct conflict and the board’s purpose is to be looking after the share owner.” The interesting part of a publicly traded franchise company is that franchisees can be both owner-operators but also owner-shareholders of the franchisor. This could be viewed both as a conflict of interest or as a “perfect interest” in both a local business (franchisee) and the brand owner (franchisor). Company 4 wants people on the board that understand franchising and have experience with the model through a variety of brands but franchisees are perceived as having invested in the business long term with different goals in mind. Company 4 also co-invests in stores’ system upgrades, covering roughly half the cost.  In recent years, activist investors pressed Company 4 to pursue refranchising, or convert corporate-owned stores to franchise stores; to restructure; sell real estate; monetarizing; and leveraging up the firm. The investors were less concerned about the credit rating than Company 4 and advocated for assuming more debt and returning more cash to shareholders.  Company 4 uses franchising because of its heritage and the value of locally connected entrepreneurs, in addition to the low capital needed for the model. The company also uses franchising because investors earn higher rates of return. Historically, the founder of Company 4 hired franchisees from a traditional perspective: few stores and a family focus. Today, Company 4 is challenging itself by reconsidering the profile of a franchisee: What if franchisees were allowed to invest all capital in the business, essentially becoming larger investment firms? By reconsidering the historical profile of the franchisee, this change entails going from a small equity stake (i.e., traditional franchisee) to a large equity stake (i.e., new investor-led model). Company 4 appears to have launched the large equity stake model, perhaps with the intent of financing and focusing on governing only the brand and intangible assets. The main reason Company 4 uses franchising seems to be for capital allocation. Less evident is the traditional conceptualization of channel research in the franchising model. Investors drive the franchise model by meeting with the owners and the board of directors, then create a governance system that acts as an internal capital market by refranchising, generating capital for the franchisor. Company 4 has no majority owner but many public minority owners represented by mutual and hedge funds, their stake not exceeding 5%. Company 4 manages owners’ expectations by listening to them and assessing whether issues and questions that arise are outliers or common among owners. Company 4 had to convince the investors by analyzing their business showing what they were doing why.  Summary Research Question 1 - Owners The first research question focused on examining how differing ownership structures affect their respective franchising systems. Specifically, what is the right amount to put back in the business? Company 4’s biggest owners are passive with no more than 5% of the outstanding shares. Going back to the question if and how the owner effected the franchise system. This is exemplified by insights from an executive who stated: the quote of an executive that stated; The owners impact even as a periodic (mutual fund, hedge fund) owners in a public franchise-owned company. These owners bring ideas to the management (CEO/CFO), then management takes the ideas to the board of directors and the owners force us to look and analyze everything, including the long-term strategy and the decision to increase cash dividend and refranchise thousands of stores at our firm. Both the family and foundation companies have a similarly high degree of owner involvement. The cooperative and the public company, meanwhile, have a similarly low degree of owner involvement given the owner’s distance in terms of geographic location and levels away from firm decision making. Overall, the companies and their owners do not appear to position maximizing shareholder value as the primary goal. Instead, this goal is alongside others such as security; longevity of concept and business model; family legacy; and satisfaction of customers, employees, and suppliers. With these other goals taking prominence, the corporate governance perspective is an important contribution in the focus of stakeholder balance. Our case-study companies are challenging the way we define the franchisee, confirming that the historical profile of the franchisee is changing. Hedge funds and mutual fund investors (owners) are forcing companies to review and challenge their franchise strategy as value-driven family firms team up with large investment family firms. Research Question 2 - The bank and other credit-lenders Company - Cooperative owned Our second question asks how the bank and other credit lenders affect the franchising system. Company 1 has no external financing from banks because it cleared all loans and sold real estate to repay them in recent years. In the future, Company 1 may need capital related to re-imaging projects or acquisitions. Today, capital is tucked away and the company has started to form its own credit companies. Other credit lenders are the member associations that have investments in the operating company. One form of funding is deposits of member contributions through associations, which come from members’ accumulated funds. The 3.5 million members create the funds and their contribution capital is $350 million, plus the associations’ excess contributions. Operating company statutes require Company 1 to have a sound capital bond that promotes the cooperative's independence and development. Company 2 – Foundation owned At Company 2, bank and financial services are used for land purchases, with loans tied to covenants. Building purchases are sometimes leased to other companies. The foundation uses its own bank and also provides financial services to franchisees. The firm owns both real estate and the land. With future new store concepts, especially those opened by other franchisees, this may be an issue in city centers, where leasing is largely the only option. Will the franchisor control the franchisees differently in the future if they do not own the real estate?  Company 3 – Private Family owned Company 3 leases virtually all locations and does not use debt because it is internally self-funded in addition to franchise partners that assume debt and sign leases to open new stores. Company 3 historically has had a strong balance sheet and leases through other credit lenders. As an executive at Company 3 notes: Since we use franchisees, they finance their stores and the rest from their own cash flow. Franchise partners do not have the same financial strength as we do (the franchisor) but they are the ones who are responsible for the financing. Company 4 – Publicly owned For Company 4, banks serve both the franchisor and franchisees, while banks serve as an important part of the franchising business. A hugely important part of the system is financing, where banks offer franchisees unique solutions. The franchisor maintains relationships with the banks so the franchisees receive financing, co-investing with franchisees in company-mandated upgrades at roughly half the cost to help with covenants and debt-coverage ratios. Sometimes Company 4 also provides a guarantee on the loans and the banks base the lending on the brand equity. The banks are comfortable lending to the franchisees and historically have received a “halo effect” for working with such a strong brand. Company 4 generally focuses on a low-cost, low-capital model and does better business as a “local company” in every country. In addition to banks, other credit lenders offer a premium with good rates. Company 4 co-invests to speed up growth. Summary Research Question 2 - The bank and other credit lenders More than half of the firms share similarities in the form of loans from a bank and other credit lenders. They all have some debt covenants they are required to meet, which function as a part of the firms’ governance system. The ownership strategy and financing of real estate are somewhat similar in that three of the four companies mostly own their real estate. This underrated real estate-financial ownership governance tool is important as it facilitates control of sites and changes in operations while maintaining a brand presence geographically. Among other similarities in financing is that two of the firms, the cooperative and foundation owned companies, have moved toward owning their own bank and credit lending alternatives for customers and franchise partners. A common theme is that franchisee partners are considered an external source of capital when they use their own funds and borrowed funds to grow concepts. Research Question 3 - Law, regulations, and auditors Company 1- Cooperative owned The third question asks how the law, regulations, and auditors affect the franchising system. As stated by one executive:  The legal perspective is top of mind all the time because legally, franchise is something like a developed commission model with a good contract in civil law. In addition, in some counties it is legally tax advantageous to have a franchise arrangement.  Company 1 does not co-invest in franchisees’ businesses and uses relatively short, three- to five-year contracts. If the franchisee store is not adequately maintained, the franchisor has the right to terminate the franchise contract, which presents as an incomplete contract. This process comes with a great deal of documentation on the process of charging expense items. As such, the actual control is considerable and follows strict rules.  Company 2 – Foundation owned For Company 2, laws and regulations affect its ownership structure because of imports and exports. The franchise system is changing due to legal restrictions. In addition, product compliance also needs to go through all local country rules. By law, franchisees receive updates on rules, what retail operations need, and how to sell the product. Retail franchisees take responsibility for local issues but the retail franchisor manages products as common practice due to design flaws.  Company 2 is confident that all parties assume both reputational risk vs financial risk is for everyone. The organization further understands that in a shared governance model where all share a common brand interest, it cannot take a traditional “owner owns everything” approach. As such, new governance models are required, especially when the largest franchisee’s sales volume exceeds that of the franchisor.  Company 3 – Private Family owned In Company 3, auditors work closely with the legal department and complex contracts control companies’ operations. Even store design is controlled with contracts, reflecting a strategy to control as much as possible through contracts that, crucially, are also well written. Because this creates an incomplete contract, it necessitates managing with relationships. Recently, a franchise competitor of Company 3 went insolvent because it managed franchisees more with contracts than through relationships. This example shows that a contract cannot completely replace a relationship, the latter of which is an important mechanism for control. Company 4 – Publicly owned For Company 4, the law, regulations, and auditors exert some effect. Company 4 follows its business model plan and legally adapts the business idea in different markets. Employees can become a legal issue in some cases where franchisees hire and fire their own employees. Sometimes the employees legally do not know for whom they work, the franchisee or the franchisor. As an executive board member stated:  The regulation drives the model for franchisees. When you have many franchisees, the risk and impact is bigger than to hire one firm or person as a franchisee in a region. Legally, franchising makes things take a little more time when you have to convince the system on changes instead of just making changes to a vertically, fully owned company. Summary Research Question 3 - Law, regulations, and auditors All of our case study companies must meet franchising systems’ legal ownership restrictions in different markets. Similarity of financial risk is the theme of legally the companies need to collaborate with a shared governance models. They all share a common interest in the firm’s brand, which means new governance models are required. Some of the firms differ in their perceptions regarding the legal tax benefits of franchising. Even if important, however, it does not seem to be the key driver and origination of the business model for most firms. In all companies, laws and regulations affect their ownership structure, sometimes due to imports and exports, on other occasions due to different global regions’ retail restrictions.Research Question 4 – Suppliers Company 1 – Cooperative owned Our fourth research question asks how suppliers affect the franchising system. Company 1’s suppliers are sometimes franchisor owned, while franchisees periodically buy self-imported products for in-store display. Nevertheless, considering the franchisor perspective, if self-imported products are sold by the franchisee, then the franchisor may need to be more competitive with pricing. In the cooperative model, the firm has even greater opportunities to sell its products because it owns the generic brands sold in the stores. Company 2 – Foundation owned In Company 2, the franchisor’s executive board member notes: “We have an assignment and goal to deliver minus 1-2% cost for products sold per year for the retail franchisees but can be more or less adjusted for currency and other changes per market.” Governance of the franchisor, also a supplier, is done through a supervisory board, audit committee, management board, and a finance committee. The franchisor’s core objectives are to provide a wide range and supply to align the entire value chain of franchisees. Strategic franchisee counsels are the forum for large franchisees to have input on range and supply. Company 2 owns some of its own suppliers and even factories. Company 3 – Private Family owned For Company 3, the system of suppliers is structured on an outsourced base. Commenting on this system, an executive board member stated: “We think it is too much risk to own suppliers or factories. Franchisees sometimes even solve their own logistics themselves but the franchisees still buy directly from us.” This markup business is a tool for Company 3 to make money on the franchise purchase; from a risk management perspective, it provides a cost-control effect.  Company 4 – Publicly owned For Company 4, the suppliers are the key to success. They have a program to source for good and focus on a “three-legged stool” composed of suppliers, franchisees, and the franchisor. For the franchisor, this system has been a successful model for stakeholders to feel empowered and to collaborate. The suppliers, franchisees, and franchisor collectively give Company 4 scalability, higher volumes, and better prices. Company 4 does not own its suppliers. Summary Research Question 4 – Suppliers In summary, the franchising systems in different markets at times are the suppliers. Retailers rarely own their suppliers but they have in common a mix of suppliers owned and not owned. Many of the suppliers for the firms have themselves grown into large global companies. The foundation-owned firm is unique in its ownership of the factory, the supplier, and components used in all factories. The franchise model governs the goods sold to consumers through the contract of purchase, meaning the franchisee must buy the products from the franchisor at set prices and then sell them at a recommended price. Research Question 5 – The Board of Directors Company 1 – Cooperative owned Our fifth research question involved determining how the board of directors affects the franchising system. At the board level of Company 1, franchisees are not a topic of discussion and no related top-level strategy exists. The cooperative company has not found the right business economic operation model in its franchise structure, the disconnect being that most problem units are being franchised. The boards of the associations have no franchise-related directive and do not discuss it. Company 1 has a modified limited franchise model. As long as the regional cooperatives cannot act as local master franchisees with control and recruitment oversight, the board is completely undeveloped and the member versus franchisee conflict remains an issue. Company 2 – Foundation owned Within Company 2 are many different boards and even one franchisee on the owner/foundation board of directors. This is not the largest franchisee but part of the family that decided to make the company foundation owned. The point of being a franchisee is to have some part still owned directly by the founding family. The board often discusses franchisees and the potential of collaboration and alignment with different levels. The many boards are supervisory board and management boards that are very small, with no women or external members. At these board meetings, Company 2 representatives discuss ownership issues, how to develop the brand, and financial investment agendas. At the supervisory board and management board meetings, the franchisor meets the need for input on the development of range and supply. Company 3 – Private Family Owned Company 3 has no franchisees on the board and does not collaborate with franchisees. The board and the CEO are involved in all new decisions about new franchisee partners. The enthusiastic operating chairman sets the direction and develops most new franchisee partnerships. Suggested remunerations and new contracts go through the board. The board also discusses the importance of franchise contracts and ownership structure of franchisees are mirroring the family owned firm with large family investment offices as franchisees. Different corporate governance codes and laws led Company 3 to use the franchise model, which is based less on contracts and more on relationships, a “handshake” between the owning family and franchisee families. The board is involved in decisions around franchising but initiatives and relationships between the CEO/chairman and families are the most important. However, the board does not talk much about the franchise other than new agreements or renewals. Control of the network franchise organization is formally mandated by the board down to a business development department that works with the board, manages the network franchise organization operationally, and is responsible for franchisees. The department also serves as the technical and digital backbone as transfer knowledge to the franchise partner is an example of how to solve franchisees’ e-commerce challenges. The rapidly changing e-commerce market has placed new demands on the franchisor to change shipping and handling from a store-only context to direct-to-consumer, incurring return and shipping costs.   The franchise partner gets access to an external ecosystem but also has some access to the franchisor’s internal system to a degree. As a result, this will change the company work. As an example, Company 3 is still determining how to develop partners’ values. Company 4 – Publicly owned Company 4 has no franchisees on the board. The board’s view on this is that the franchisee is in the business with another purpose. Company 4 board meetings do, however, include discussions on franchisee relations and the potential of collaboration. At every board meeting, a franchisee sentiment is discussed because the board has to be aware of what the franchisees feel about the business. Board members visit the stores in their official capacity in addition to visits from “mystery shoppers” who see how retail operations are run. Board members are recent private equity or former CEOs and most of the board members have a consumer background. The CEO is the only employee on the board and he can vote, while the CFO attends all meetings merely as a spectator. The CEO is in discussions, but at every board meeting session, members meet for a period of time without the CEO present, an important mechanism mandated in the corporate governance system. Company 4 seeks board members who understand franchising and have experience.  Summary Research Question 5 – The Board of Directors Our case-study companies have in common board on which franchisees often do not serve as members. Directors on these boards also share similar ideas about the role of franchisees, namely that they went into business with another purpose. Some of the companies do not even talk about the franchise partners at every board meeting. Only one of the firms uses a franchise sentiment at every board meeting as a governance mechanism, measuring the level of franchisees’ business state of mind. Clearly, one of the four case companies is thinking with a franchise governance focus at board meetings and throughout the system.  Findings Summary of empirical findings  Table 2 presents Company findings of the case companies. Table 2. Without exception, all the firms in this study apply contracts as a buffer between governance layers, signifying a relational governance view not only from that of the franchisor but also from the higher-order view of the board and owners. The four companies all share common denominators but differ in how they govern the business. One of our findings involves how they view their franchisees’ dependence on the ownership structure. They are all based on contracts but depending on the company ownership structure, they all view the franchisees differently. These firms also differ in why they use franchising. The cooperative company’s (Company 1) use of franchising is more a consequence than an intention. Company 1 uses franchising after having tested the model, then ended up with a franchise structure without a goal for the franchise business model or a system to govern it. The foundation company (Company 2) uses franchising because the founder decided to avoid the public market in order to diversify idiosyncratic risk and still maintain the control of the company. The family company (Company 3) chose to use franchising to expand in specific markets for legal reasons but seeks to govern franchisees by values. The publicly traded company (Company 4) uses franchising by heritage because it was founded by a franchisee that became the franchisor of the corporate-owned company in addition to the investors’ appetite for their franchise model. We attempt to clarify the domain of governance in franchising with the matrix in Figure 3. Contribution toward a typology of governance in franchising  Corporate governance affects a franchise system at different levels. Below, we show a typology based on our case interviews in Figure 3, which shows the companies’ different levels, degrees, and attitudes of ownership and governance. This connects to the external model in Figure 1, areas C and D, but adds new insight.   Figure 3. Degree of shareholder/owner involvement: Family Hi: In the family firm, the owner is normally active and a majority owner. Owners have a high level of impact. Cooperative Low: In the cooperative firm, the members/owners are passive and far away, represented by local sub-arranged co-ops with associations. Members/owners have low level of impact and members can always walk away.  Foundation Hi: In the foundation-owned firm, the owner is active and close to the firm. Owners have a high level of impact usually no other owners. Public Low: In the publicly traded firm, most owners/shareholders are far away and represented by passive mutual funds. Members/owners have a low level of impact. Degree of franchise firm governance: Family Low: When the family firm and owner (sometimes the CEO) are closer, there is a lower need for governance. Thus, a shorter distance between owner and management creates a lower degree of governance. Cooperative Low: When the cooperative firm and the owner (sometimes also the customer) are the members, they are often closer, lowering the need for governance. Thus, a shorter distance between owner/member and management creates a lower degree of governance. Foundation Hi: When access to the foundation and a high level of governance with a foundation owner sometimes far away with a long distance between owner and board creates high degree of governance. Public Hi: When access to external capital on the public market a high level of governance with a long distance between owner and management creates high degree of governance. Discussion In studies of corporate governance, Aguilera and Jackson (2010) examine the difference in corporate governance systems in different parts of the world. Corporate governance can be seen as governing corporations, governing the interaction between companies, and governing markets. Anglo-American governance has been a topic of study for nearly a century (Berle and Means 1932). Based on agency theory and the conflict of interest, Berle and Means (1932) note several fundamental problems, such as increased monitoring cost and reduced profitability. Should franchisees in global firms be on the board of directors? The franchisees normally do not vote on the board but they do presentations for the board about franchisee business and their sentiments. In governance, the separation of chairperson and CEO are different depending on the country. One way of thinking of franchisees on the board could be that of the German model, in which companies have employee representation. Should this, then, extend to franchisees, which have a capital interest in the firm, and even suppliers? Having employees and suppliers one step away from the owner may create a conflict of interest. If employees are on the board, for example, do they objectively look out for what is the best for the owners? Do franchise firms have a lower cost of capital and better credit ratings? Are independent ownership models that govern with the franchise model experiencing lower leverage and risk than firms not using this model? Is this perhaps a “capital redirection” interest when the owner of the franchisor can get fast streams of cash even when the business generates a great deal of cash? One example of this is one of the case companies’ initiative to refranchise thousands of stores, a commitment that could return billions in cash to the owners. If the franchisees are not owners, the strategy could prove difficult to execute given that this cash could have been reinvested into entrepreneurial owners and built the brand. The sale of the stores creates new types of both governance models in franchising. The use of new development licenses trades traditional franchisees for financial buyers that act as investment partners, a much different dynamic from the franchisees’ mere position as operational experts in the past. One especially interesting point is how we view the cooperative franchisee’s members’ demands for profitability and economic growth. The problem of ignorance and the dualism with the franchise cooperative cannot be seen from one side. The member interest is not a financial delivery but a good store without a regular consumer market this is an educational task (Holmstrom 1999; Hansmann 1988). The family franchise is certainly seeing the benefit of not hiring all the staff, and with the franchise model it does not manage human resources in franchise market areas. The franchise networks make no difference to the customer. Compared to other brands with a more standardized product retail system, this is much harder to control. The family franchise firm is doing this by training the partners through value-based steering. In this study, we have examined truly global franchise firms. Perhaps the problem for some firms is that franchising is not an intention but a consequence. There no strategic intention, therefore it is relatively undisputed how franchise companies rapidly unload and refranchise  because it speeds up capital returns.  Conclusions and future research  Our results imply that further investigation with larger and more diverse data sets is required. In future research, it would be interesting to test and measure the level of the relationship between a larger quantitative sample to see levels of variation in franchise governance and shareholder involvement. In this paper, we have explored and presented valuable content for analyzing and understanding the separation of ownership and control within franchise firm corporate governance. This study provided insights about governance in franchising from a higher-order corporate governance view. Additionally, further research could explore and add additional ownership types. The case study companies develop the notion of an “ownership disconnect.” This is new terminology for when a firm’s shareholders focus on results with one time horizon and investors in the public market have a completely different time frame for the investment. If a public market investor is focused on quarterly performance and the controlling family investor has a 30 to 50-year, or “forever,” perspective, this can increase the risk for governance issues and frustration, not to mention media pressure and bad press.   The business model itself is extremely profitable for some of the case companies. Historical research indicates that the main business method of franchising eventually would be corporate owned (Oxenfeldt and Kelly 1968). However, in this study we see something different, especially from the perspective of an investor that continues to invest in and like the franchise model. It would be a giant task to first staff the human resource organization and then the full retail network that would be needed were all the thousands of stores corporate owned and not franchised. A key finding of this paper is that franchising in practice is not an isolated corporate decision of an optimal franchise level that strategy researchers try to attain. Instead, the owners put demands on the franchising model for a higher or lower level of this mix.  \n",
      "PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS OF AUTHORITATIVE, CONTRACTUAL AND NORMATIVE CONTROL MECHANISMS The Case of Franchising  Ilir HajdiniDepartment of Business Administration University of Vienna Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria ilir.hajdini@univie.ac.atJosef WindspergerDepartment of Business Administration University of Vienna Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria josef.windsperger@univie.ac.atPresented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 24-26, 2021      PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS OF AUTHORITATIVE, CONTRACTUAL AND NORMATIVE CONTROL MECHANISMS The Case of Franchising  Abstract The causes of performance in franchise networks have been overlooked. Thisarticleshows the impact of multiple control mechanisms on franchise system performance. We find that franchisors use authoritative, contractual, normative and equity control mechanisms to maintain chain uniformity, standardization and brand image. The primary data from Germany and Switzerland support our claims that bilateral forms of control enhance franchise systems` profitability and growth, while unilateral authoritative control diminishes performance. Equity control through higher proportion of company-owned outlets increases efficiency and coordination, but does not impact networks’ profitability.  Key words: authoritative control, contractual control, normative control, equity control, franchise system performance  Introduction  Business format franchising has been subject of investigation for long time because of its widespread application across different industries and economies (Heide, 1994; Dant et al., 2011). The franchisor ensues a business concept and initiates expansion mainly through franchisees’ resources who put trust on the future value of the franchisor’s brand, business model and capabilities to attract entrepreneurs and customers willing to pay. Franchisees commit specific investments to set up their outlets, pay upfront fees, engage in operation management of their businesses, and pay ongoing marketing and royalty fees. However, this partnership becomes cloudier when franchise networks span across industries and countries challenged by legally autonomous franchisee entrepreneurs with divergent goals and potentially opportunistic behavior (Barthélemy, 2008). In response, the franchisor has to use a series of control and incentive mechanisms to minimize such tensions and enhance network performance.  A large number of scholars have explored control issues in inter-organizational networks (e.g. Brown et al. 2003; Chalos and O'Connor 2004; Choi and Beamish 2004; Dant and Nasr 1998; Das and Teng 1998; Dekker 2004; Doherty and Alexander 2006; Gatignon and Anderson 1988; Geringer and Hebert 1989; Grewal et al. 2013; Jaussaud and Schaaper 2006; Glaser, Jirasek and Windsperger, 2020). However, they have still not provided a general theoretical foundation of control as major pillar of the governance structure of the firm (Liu et al. 2014). Most of the prior work identifies a broad range of control mechanisms (Mellewigt et al., 2011, Vázquez, 2008; Hajdini et al., 2017) including formal, informal and relational norms as means to exercise decision control in networks (Hunt and Nevin, 1974, Quinn 1999; Quinn and Doherty, 2000; Elango and Fried, 1997). Preceding studies are mainly qualitative in nature (Quinn, 1999; Quinn and Doherty, 2000; Doherty and Alexander, 2006), and show that several control mechanisms can be simultaneously used to govern franchise systems. However, there is a paucity of research that shows how the use of such control mechanisms influences the performance of franchise networks (e.g., Azevedo 2009; Doherty and Alexander 2006; Kerim et al, 2018; Mellewigt et al. 2011; Hajdini et al., 2017).   In this study, we apply the concept of control developed by Weitz and Jap (1995), who identify authoritative, contractual and normative control mechanisms depending on whether firms involved in interorganizational relationships participate in mutual or unilateral decision making. Authoritative control reflects the use of decision power by one firm to unilaterally control the activities of the other, while contractual and normative control represent a more bilateral use of power, mutual coordination, and trust among firms (Heide, 1994; Weitz and Jap, 1995). Besides, in franchising, the franchisor may choose to strategically use a dual ownership structure of “integration” through company-owned outlets and “non-integration” through franchised outlets (Baker et al. 2008). A higher proportion of company-owned outlets is used to increase coordination and control (Gillisa, Combs and Yind, 2020; Glaser et al., 2020). Hence, we extend the concept of Weitz and Jap (1995) to additionally investigate the performance effect of franchisor’s hierarchical/equity control in networks. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: Which control mechanisms enhance network performance? Our study contributes to franchising literature by empirically showing the performance effect of authoritative, contractual, normative and equity control in franchise networks. Shedding light on this under-researched topic could help the franchisor sketch more supportive control design strategies and adopt policies to enhance network performance (Combs et al., 2004). We also contribute to a broader literature of interorganizational and entrepreneurial networks, which drawing from the agency and transaction cost theories, assumes that the franchisor (i.e. principal) and franchisees (i.e. agents) may intentionally pursue competing goals (Barney and Ouchi, 1986; Doherty and Quinn, 1999), and as a result emphasizes the role of contractual and hierarchical control to increase coordination efficiency and mitigate risks of opportunism (Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019; Williamson, 1981). Additionally, we add to two important research streams of strategic and organization management literature, which drawing from the resource based and relational theories, assume that franchise resources, organization competences (Barney, 1991; Combs et al., 2011) and trust-building transactions are of crucial importance to the long-lasting competitive advantage and firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Hence, we highlight that the franchisor’s control capabilities will result in higher network performance due to coordination and transaction cost saving as well as knowledge creation and trust properties of multiple control mechanisms (Heide, 1994; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001; Weitz and Jap, 1995). Nonetheless, the nature and extent of control may dependent on partners’ system-specific investments and knowhow (Gillis, et al., 2020, Hajdini et al., 2017). Therefore, while assessing the performance effect of different control mechanisms, we account for specific investments, resources/capabilities and relational bonds among franchise partners. We operationalize the specified measures using primary data instead of relying on proxy based secondary data, and consider the franchisors’ point of view instead of repeatedly relying on franchisees perspectives (Gillis et al., 2020). The paper is organized as follows: section two explores the literature review. Section three builds on the hypotheses related to the performance effect of all four control mechanisms in franchise systems. Section four presents the empirical analysis. Finally, we discuss the results and draw conclusions for theory and practice. Related literature and hypotheses Related literature and hypotheses One of the earliest studies in the field of franchise management identifies a couple of means to exercise decision control including coercive control (e.g. contract termination), and non-coercive control (e.g. trainings, assistance, rewards) (Hunt and Nevin, 1974). Both mechanisms are found to enhance firm performance either by reducing opportunistic behavior or leveraging knowledge transfer (Weitz & Jap, 1995; Kerim et al., 2018; Marjolein et al., 2010). For instance, Quinn (1999) and Quinn and Doherty (2000) show that both mechanisms complementarily improve franchise financial outcomes and relationships, but non-coercive mechanisms of control are preferred when franchisors lack experience and knowledge in their head offices. Another study shows, however, that non-coercive control is more frequently used by five out of six international fashion franchisors (Doherty and Alexander, 2006). Similarly, Marjolein et al. (2010) imply that administrative and relational means of control do reduce franchisees’ opportunism. Kerim et al (2018) show that organizational control in franchising facilitates knowledge transfer and even enhances innovations.  An instructive example that shows the consequences when firms use inadequate control mechanisms is that of Burger King Europe. In 2014, the giant fast food franchise network, announces a shutdown of 89 franchisees from a total of 700 restaurants in Germany. This decision was taken after an undercover report made by local media, which revealed that expired foods were relabeled as fresh and were kept warm for a long time instead of being grilled freshly. Further infractions revealed that sanitary standards were violated, and employee holiday payments and bonuses were squeezed. This led to negative effects on the franchisor’s brand reputation, sales, stakeholder trust, and stock prices. Similar examples of inadequate use of organizational control are repeatedly reported to have caused sever negative consequences in other franchise chains (e.g. one of McDonalds’ Chinese suppliers was found to have been selling expired meat Rf). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify the nature of and examine the possible effects of control mechanisms to use in order to prevent similar devastating performance consequences. A misfit in the use of different control mechanisms can either hamper the franchisor’s brand image and standardization or franchisees motivation for local adaptation (Kerim et al, 2018; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019).  Authoritative control The concept of authoritative control denotes the extent of franchisor’s authority to influence decisions over different value chain activities at the local outlets of franchisees (i.e. pricing, advertising, product and service, human resource management, procurement and supplier selection) (Weitz and Jap 1995; Mohr et al. 1996). This is similar to the concept of decision rights in organizational economics, which refers to the authority regarding deployment and use of the firm’s assets (Simon 1951; Hansman 1996). High authoritative control means that the franchisor’s headquarters have a high proportion of residual control over the value chain activities at the local outlets of the franchise system.  An instructive example that shows how using inadequate level of control is that of Burger King Europe. In 2014, the giant fast food franchise network, announces a shutdown of 89 franchisees from a total of 700 restaurants in Germany. This decision was taken after an undercover report made by local media, which revealed that expired foods were relabeled as fresh and were kept warm for a long time instead of being grilled freshly. Further infractions revealed that sanitary standards were violated, and employee holiday payments and bonuses were squeezed. This led to negative effects on the franchisor’s brand reputation, sales, stakeholder trust, and stock prices. Therefore, a misfit in the use of control can either hamper the franchisor’s brand image and standardization or franchisees motivation for local adaptation (Kerim et al, 2018; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019).  In the Burger King case, too much autonomy, might have resulted in opportunism and other agency problems diluting franchisors’ brand equity and its ability to operate (Dant and Gundlach, 1999). In response, more franchisor authoritative control in Burger King’s value chain activities of product/service decisions, human resource management, and procurement, could have prevented the scandal. For instance, Hajdini and his colleagues (2017) show that more franchisor authoritative control strengthens the positive performance effect of intangible assets, and weakens the negative performance effect of uncertainties. Doherty and Alexander (2006) find that franchisees ask for more franchisor control under conditions of business uncertainty. On the other hand, Dant and Gundlach (1999) argue that an extensive centralization of control authority may be detrimental to franchisees’ motivation. Hayek (1935, 1940) highlights that decision authority can be efficiently centralized only if the central planer has location and time specific knowledge. Similarly, March and Simon (1958) argue that as the amount of information-processing capabilities of CEOs are limited, decision authority should be delegated (see also Van Zandt, 1999). Furthermore, Weitz and Jap (1995) argue that franchisors gain strategic advantages as they shift from authoritative types of control to more contractual and normative cooperation types of control. Similarly, Aghion and Tirole (1997) point out that the principal can increase agent’s motivation to participate in contractual relationships if it delegates authority over activities important to the agent. This results in more motivation for franchisees to react promptly and exchange the obtained local market knowledge with franchisors (Sorensen and Sorensen, 2001; Windsperger, 2004). Hence, the following alternative hypotheses can be formulated:  H1a: The franchisor that exercises more authoritative control (on value chain activities) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H1b: The franchisor that exercises more authoritative control (on value chain activities) experiences lower franchise system performance. Contractual control  Stinchcombe (1985) notes that when hierarchies are flattened to more network-like organizations, authority can be exercised through contractual clauses. Similarly, Weitz and Jap (1995) proclaim that franchise networks rely more often on bilateral forms of contractual and normative control mechanisms. Contractual control can be exercised through clauses that include dealing, territorial, tying, RPM, call option, leasing, alienation, and non-competition clauses (Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). More specifically, contracts can specify franchise partners’ geographic territory within which the franchisees can operate or within which the franchisor abstains from operating. This has shown to prevent free riding externalities and improve the quality of available services (Lafontaine and Slade, 2014; Zanarone, 2009). Similarly, the contractual clauses of tying and dealing that authorize the franchisee to acquire the raw material from franchisor’s appointed suppliers and sell only brand-related products can influence the set and quality of products available to consumers (Marvel, 1982). For instance, the dealing clause can facilitate the promotion of individual brands (Chen, 2012), increase brand-related and market sales (Sass, 2005), and lowers distributor costs (Asker, 2004). Moreover, the resale price maintenance, which restricts franchisees to maximum prices they can charge, can prevent high-profit margins or the so-called double marginalization problem (Rey and Verge, 2008). Further, the franchisor’s leasing of physical premises to franchisees provides the franchisor with more decision control over its franchisees safeguarding franchisor’s transaction specific investments and allowing franchisees to overcome resource scarcities (Lashley and Rowson, 2002). Thus, the exercised level of control via contractual restraints can play a positive role in determining the relationship among franchise partners, and thereby the performance of franchise networks (Dutta, Heide, & Bergen, 1999; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019).  In franchising, although the franchisor might establish the contractual terms (e.g. contractual restraints) and communicate them to franchisees, the process of contractual design is in the sense bilateral as both parties can accept or negotiate changes (Weitz and Jap, 1995). Hence, assuming that contractual terms are cooperatively designed and agreed upon by the franchise partners, they should serve to align partner objectives and increase efficiency (Weitz and Jap, 1995; Lafontaine and Slade, 2014). Nonetheless, some scholars show that extensive control exercised via such restraints might negatively influence the performance of franchise networks. For instance, Heide and Dutta (1998) argue that some companies may be discouraged from using exclusive dealing as they impose searching costs on end users (customers). Further, Grimes (1999) suggests that tying arrangements allow franchisors to potentially collude with their vendors (selected suppliers) to increase prices of inputs/raw materials to their franchisees for a rebate that the vendor could then pay to the franchisor. Franchisors could also demand higher prices for the tied supplies relative to alternatives that franchisees could find on the market. Similarly, territorial exclusivity might protect negligent or opportunistic franchisees from competition, who could in turn damage the franchisor’s brand reputation and slow down the overall sales by reducing service quality, or increasing prices (Smith, 1982). Likewise, according to Adams and Jones (1997, p. 260), leasing clauses can make the franchisee reluctant to make outlet specific investments as they could more easily be displaced by the franchisor. Finally, as the explicit call option clause provides the franchisor the legal right to potentially acquire its franchisees at low prices while retaining their strategic locations (Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019), this clause may demotivate franchisees to make outlet specific investments.  Accordingly, the following alternative hypotheses can be formulated:  H2a: The franchisor that exercises more contractual control (via contractual restraints) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H2b: The franchisor that exercises more contractual control (via contractual restraints) experiences lower franchise system performance.  Normative control  Normative control is exercised bilaterally as both franchise partners continuously influence and adhere to relationship norms, which are not discreet, but evolve over time through repeated interactions (Weitz and Jap, 1995). This mechanism accounts for the role of the relational norms such as trustworthiness (Lado, Dant and Tekleb, 2008), which has shown to play a vital role in sustaining channel relationships (Gulati, 1995; Heide and John, 1992; Macneil, 1983; Thorgren and Wincent, 2011; Uzzi, 1997). As contracts cannot specify all contingencies, governance through informal mechanisms can reduce opportunism, mitigate transaction costs and increase satisfaction (Reuer and Arino, 2007). Indeed, the earlier findings of Hunt and Nevin (1974) show that franchisees’ satisfaction is increased with normative sources of decision control. Similarly, latter studies present that when partners make mutual decisions based on trustful relations, this can improve the level of franchisee-compliant behaviors (Davies et al, 2011; Dickey et al., 2008), increases franchisee satisfaction (Dickey et al., 2008), and dilute agency costs (Cochet et al., 2008). This suggests that normative control that enforces shared norms based on managerial support, trainings and mutual trust from successive collaborations among franchise partners, increases mutual understanding about each-others’ managerial expectations, organizational cultures, and operations (Gulati, 1995) leading to more favorable outcomes. Hence, using normative control based on experienced-based trust developed through successive interactions lessens the potential monitoring costs, post-contract litigations, and dispute resolutions improving the performance of the overall network.  However, relying extensively on normative control assuming that partners are going to behave in compliance with the overall franchisor goals may be unrealistic according to agency theory proponents (Barney and Ouchi, 1986; Eisenhardt, 1989). Such a practice might signal lack of concern and lack of managerial capability of the franchisor, and thereby undermine franchisor’s role and brand (Doherty and Alexander 2006; Hajdini et al, 2017). Further, the use of normative control to establish long-term partner relationships may be costly due to perceived uncertainties that one of the partners may not realize the expected risk-adjusted-returns or that it may not be able to appropriate the deserved share of returns (Weitz and Jap, 1995). This may be due to changing environmental uncertainties, partners’ potential opportunism or bounded rationality to assess correctly the share contribution of each partner generated from their idiosyncratic investments (Williamson, 1975, 1991). As a result, franchise partners may focus on such possible outcomes overlooking the potential value from joint collaboration and investments. Hence, we formulate the following alternative hypotheses: H3a: The franchisor that exercises more normative control (via successive trustworthy collaborations) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H3b: The franchisor that exercises more normative control (via successive trustworthy collaborations) experiences lower franchise system performance. Equity control  Franchisor’s equity control is exercised through an increase in the franchisor’s proportion of company-owned outlets (Glaser et al., 2020). The franchisor can decide to increase the proportion of owned outlets nearby its franchisees (or near the exclusive territories of its franchisees) for several reasons. First, this may help reduce information asymmetries with local markets (e.g., Gillis et al., 2020) allowing the franchisor to understand the amount of local demand for standardized services and new products, and b) customer reactions subsequent to new pricing or advertising strategies. Further, this might alleviate franchisees’ tendencies to potentially under-report sales’ revenues, which may serve as the bases to specifying the amount of ongoing royalties they need to pay to their franchisors. Additionally, higher equity control allows the maintenance of certain quality standard by the franchisor’s owned outlets, which in turn may mitigate franchisees’ potential free-riding practices (Grossman and Hart, 1986), who in absence of franchisor’s presence, may engage in fierce price competition to later end up offering low quality products and services under the assumption that the associated costs from unmet customer expectations would be borne by all franchisees of the same brand in the same region (i.e. free-riding).      Nonetheless, it has been shown that franchisees are more innovative than employees of company-owned outlets to respond more promptly and adequately to changing customers tastes as franchisees’ income is tightly related to their business activities (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Therefore, an extensive level of equity control might result in high transaction and agency costs partly descending from weak incentives of company-owned managers, whose income is tightly related to their monthly wages. Hence, company-owned managers may exaggerate their efforts and performance to attract the franchisor’s attention or follow other than the franchisor’s objectives, thereby imposing slow decision making and high monitoring costs (Bradach, 1997; Rubin, 1978). Further, it is shown that higher franchisees’ entrepreneurial autonomy increases local market know-how generation (Kerim et al., 2018) and reduces litigation costs and contract terminations (López-Fernández and López-Bayón, 2018). Consequently, an extensive integration to exercise equity control at the expense of franchisees’ autonomy may humper the entrepreneurial spirit and innovations in franchise networks (Kerim et al, 2018, Windsperger, 2004).  Accordingly, two alternative hypotheses can be formulated:  H4a: The franchisor that exercises more equity control (via higher proportion of franchisor-owned outlets) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H4b: The franchisor that exercises more equity control (via higher proportion of franchisor-owned outlets) experiences lower franchise system performance.  Empirical Analysis  Data Collection To test these hypotheses, we collected the data from franchise systems in Germany and Switzerland. Prior to data collection, we refined and improved the questionnaire following several interviews that we conducted with franchise professionals from the respective franchise associations. Twenty five franchisors participated in the final modification process. They suggested that to ensure a more confident level of knowledge about the franchise partners, questionnaires should aim at respondents with a minimum number of years of inter-organizational experience and a minimum network size (e.g. number of outlets). Thus, we decided that any franchise system selected should have started franchising at least two years prior to the study and should have at least five operating outlets to be considered a useful observation. Correspondingly, out of all the systems listed by the German Franchise Federation and the Swiss Franchise Association, the questionnaire was mailed to 667 German and Swiss franchise systems. We send the questionnaires to senior managers who were considered responsible for franchise expansion, based on their expertise and relevance to the subject under investigation (McKendall & Wagner III 1997). We chose a quantitative approach using a standardized questionnaire, which was sent out by email and by postal mail. The choice of an online survey offers various advantages over an offline survey. Using an online survey results in lower costs of data collection and analysis and enables accessibility to a greater number of participants. At the same time, various participants may take part in the survey, extending the geographic scope of the random sample. The main disadvantages of online surveys relate to the considerable loss of control over the execution of the survey. Researchers cannot be sure who filled in the questionnaire, therefore it is hard to reassess the effect of say equity control on performance related archival data. The number of questionnaires returned was 170, representing a response rate of close to 29 percent from Germany and 17 percent from Switzerland. However, due to missing values, 143 responses could be used in this study.  We also assessed the likelihood of non-response bias by comparing the results obtained from late to early respondents. The ANOVA test revealed no significant difference between the two respondent groups (Armstrong & Overton, 1977). The late respondents served as proxies for non-respondents and included those who completed the questionnaire four weeks after the first group of respondents. Further, the common method variance (CMV) was tested by conducting a single factor analysis of the items of all subjective measures, which revealed six distinct factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1.0. The first component explains 27.2 percent of the variance, while all of them taken together explain 64.8 percent (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). Thus, Harman’s single-factor test negates the possibility of confounded interpretations, since no factor accounts for most of the variance. We still used several additional techniques as suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2003) to minimize the CMV risk. We used different anchors and scales for the dependent and independent survey items. The dependent variable of performance and two independent survey items (authoritative and normative control) were derived using seven-point Likert with differing anchors (1= very low influence, 7 – very high influence, and from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree), while one additional independent variable was derived using binary questions (contractual control), and the final variable was derived asking the franchisors to fill the number of owned and franchised outlets they licensed (for more details on construct composition and variable operationalization, please regard the subsequent sub-section). We finally included a two-item measure to test for possible social desirability of franchisors' proclivity to potentially give biased answers. Measures Dependent Variable The performance of the franchise system is measured by subjective indicators since the majority of franchise systems do not disclose objective (financial) information. Further, scholars have attempted to assess and compare subjective and objective indicators finding a high level of correlation between them (Geringer & Hebert 1991; Glaister & Buckley 1998; Wall et al. 2004). Nonetheless, the approach to derive single item and objective measures to capture the multidimensionality of firm performance has been questioned (Richard et al., 2009). As a result, we asked franchisors to assess the extent to which they achieved the following system goals last year: system growth, revenue increases, profit increases, savings in coordination, control and administrative costs, alignment of products and services to customer needs, and effectiveness in coordination between head-office and outlets (Hajdini & Windsperger, 2019). The responses were assessed on a seven-point scale (1= very low influence, 7 – very high influence). To assess whether the mentioned items load on different performance constructs, we apply exploratory factor analysis. Following varimax rotation, two factors were retained as their corresponding eigenvalues exceeded one. The principal components factor analysis are presented in table 1: Insert Table 1 The two retained factors explained 63 percent of variance. Communalities exceed the threshold level of 0.50 with the exception of one item (alignment of products and services to customer needs). This indicates that that the two factors capture a significant portion of the variance. The internal consistency of franchise system profitability and growth and of franchise system efficiency are above the recommended cut-off value of Cronbach alpha: 0.86 and 0.78 respectively (Cronbach, 1951). Independent Variables Authoritative control represents the allocation of decision-making authority between franchisor and franchisees. The variable assessed on a seven-point scale (1= very low influence, 7 – very high influence) captures the extent of the franchisor’s influence on operational decisions regarding the selection of suppliers, resale price, advertising, product/service offering, equipment and procurement decisions, new product decisions, and application of accounting and controlling systems (Windsperger, 2004). The control variable was constructed by averaging the scale values, which vary between 1 and 7. The higher the franchisor’s influence on residual decision-making in the network, the higher the index of the authoritative control. Contractual control represent the degree of contractual restraints used in franchise contracts (i.e. exclusive territory, exclusive dealing, tying and non-competition arrangements, resale price maintenance, lease control, real option and alienation rights). Franchisors were asked to indicate whether they use restraint clauses in their contracts (1 if yes, 0 otherwise). Thus, the operationalization of this measure follows that used by Parkhe (1993) and Reuer and Arino (2007), where different types of franchise contractual restraints are arrayed in increasing order of strength or severity to arrive at a global measure that represents the degree of franchise contractual control used. Contractual control stringency is derived using the following weighting scheme:   (1) CC (weighted) =        where CC represents the degree of used contractual control in franchising,  equals  if the th restraint is employed, and zero if not (Parkhe, 1993). That is, equals one if the first restraint is used (two if the second is used) and zero otherwise. The sum ranges between 0 and 36, which when divided by 36, yields values between 0 and 1. In other words, when CC equals 1, contractual control is high because all eight contractual restraint clauses are used. For further details regarding the use of restrictive contractual clauses, view table 2: Insert Table 2 Normative control can be exercised through trust built from repeated relational exhanges. Previous postive and repeated exhanges between franchise partners enhances mutual trust, which is essential to reduce the threat ofopportunism and encourage exchange of information, coordination, and cooperation (Das and Teng, 2004; Gulati et al., 2012; Weitz & Jap, 1995). Franchise partners are therefore ready to rely more on normative control and less on other mechanisms of control. Adapted from Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) and Dyer and Chu (2000), we asked franchisors to rate the following four items (1= strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree) with respect to the quality of relationships they have with their franchisees: There is great degree of sucessive trustworthy cooperation between ourselves and our franchisees, the cooperation with our franchisees is based on partnership basis, there is an atmosphere of openness and honesty between us and our franchisees, and the exchange of information between us and our franchisees goes beyond the agreed scope. The higher the construct’s index, the higher the level of normative control (Weitz and Jap, 1995).  Equity control is calculated by the number of company-owned outlets divided by thetotal number of outlets in all respective countries (in our case: Germany and Switzerland). The franchisor was asked to provide with the number of outlets they own and license. This approach has been derived and operationalized in a similar fashion by prior scholars (Glaser et al., 2020; Windsperger and Dant. 2006). ONTROL ARIABLES To control for possible confounders, we initially control for size, which represents the total number of franchised and company-owned outlets. Smaller firms might lack the necessary resources and capabilities to use different control mechanisms (Reuer and Arino, 2007). From a transaction cost theoretical perspective, larger firms should have a higher control capacity (Erramilli and Rao, 1993). The size of franchising systems is measured by the log number of total number of outlets. Similarly, older firms (age) should have higher financial capital as well as more capacity employ control mechanisms and inter-organizational learning. As time passes, there is a tendency of grwoing experience with established practices and routines that may raise efficiency and performance levels of franchise systmes (Sorenson & Sørensen 2001). The age of franchising systems is measured by the log number of years since the first opened thier first franchise outlet. We further control for the initial fees, and ongoing royalty fees found in franchise contractual agreements. The literature predicts that the structure of these fees can affect the franchise system performance as they can determine the way the joint profit is shared between the franchise partners as well as indirectly affect the way the joint targets are set (e.g. sales, retail prices, advertising etc.) (Rey and Verge, 2008). Next, we also use contract duration, which influences franchise network performance, because the longer the contracts, the higher the likelyhood that franchisees can reimburse their relationship-specific investments (Joskow, 1987; Brickley et al., 2006; Crocker and Masten, 1988). This sugessts that shorter contract durations provides the option not to renew non-performing franchisee contracts. We next control for franchisor’s system-specific know-how, which includes its knowledge in site selection, store layout, product development, and procurement (Kacker, 1988). Finally, we account for the the franchisee’s local market know-how, which include its marketing, human resource, quality control, as well as innovation capabilities (Hall, 1993; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001) that can influence the franchise system performance due to the fact that they cannot be easily transferred and acquired by the franchisor or other franchise partners.  Empirical Results We initially report descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients. Table 3 shows that the mean of franchise system profitability ( ̅x = 4.2) is on average relatively lower than that of franchise system efficiency ( ̅x = 4.5), and that there is a strong positive association between the two categories of franchise system performance. Surprisingly, initial fees and royalties show no association with franchise system performance measures, but more with other variables. Further, we tested for possible multicollinearity, however, the low variance inflation factors (VIF range between 1.20 and 1.69) indicate that multicollinearity does not affect the results of our analysis.    Insert Table 3 To test the hypotheses regarding the impact of authoritative, contractual, normative and equity control on franchise system performance (i.e. profitability and system efficiency), we carried out seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) (Zellner, 1962). This provides a way to capture the influence of multiple information sources and outcomes using several equations, and accounts for contemporaneous correlations while estimating the parameters of franchise system profitability and franchise system efficiency simultaneously. This results in greater efficiency of the parameter estimates by controlling for correlation among error terms across franchise system performance equations (Zellner, 1962). The SUR analysis shows a significant correlation in the error terms across franchise system profitability and growth and franchise system efficiency equations. The Breusch-Pagan test shows that the application of SUR is a preferred estimation method since it rejects the null hypothesis that the error terms are independent (i.e., all estimation models show that χ^2 are significant at p p<0.000). The results of multivariate seemingly unrelated regressions are presented in table 4a and table 4b.   Insert Table 4a Insert Table 4b We find support for the alternative proposition (H1b), namely that higher franchisor authoritative control will negatively influence the franchise system performance. We find support for this prediction in all estimation models irrespective of whether we use control variables or regress authoritative control on both dimensions of performance alone. Table 4b shows the latter case in which we additionally assess step-by-step the individual effect of all hypothesized predictors on both dimensions of franchise system performance. Further, the data provide support to the next hypotheses of H2a and H3a inferring that contractual and normative control mechanisms do positively influence the franchise systems’ profitability and growth and franchise systems’ efficiency. This indicates that franchisors that use contractual and normative control methods (e.g. via using important contractual restraint clauses, and non-coercive control means of trust nurturing) to govern franchise activities, save coordination control and administrative costs, grow faster and generate higher revenues and higher profits. Finally, equity control through higher proportion of owned outlets does not show to influence the franchise systems’ profitability and growth with minor influence on franchise systems’ efficiency (table 4a, model 12). This indicates that cost savings from coordination control and administrative activities can be obtained from higher ownership stakes, but not systems’ profitability.  Table 4a shows that we examine whether the hypotheses are supported when using a rich number of franchise related control variables to minimize the potential confounder effects of other than the hypothesized predictors. We controlled for the effect of franchise systems age, size, initial and royalty fees, contract duration, franchisor’s system specific know-how, and franchisees local market know-how, which otherwise cannot be captured. If one tracks the repeating pattern of significance effects through all estimation models in table 4a, it is evident that larger franchise systems, those that perceive that they possess system specific know-how, and those that issue longer contracts to their franchisees enjoy higher performance levels. To our surprise, systems that cooperate with more skilled local franchisees seem to suffer from lower efficiency (but not from lower levels of profitability and growth). This may be due to the fact that innovative franchisees may increase franchisor’s monitoring and other coordination costs (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Table 4b provides additional evidence that the effects of the hypothesized predictors on performance dimensions of franchise systems are still evident even if one does not control for firm characteristics. Discussion Franchising nurtures an entrepreneurial environment for rapid expansion (Shane, 1996), while at the same time exposes franchise partners to opportunism that can degrade the common brand (Michael, 2000, Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). This raises questions about the nature of control mechanisms that some franchisors can use to maintain service uniformity and incentivize local adaptation. However, virtually nothing is known about how authoritative, contractual, normative or equity control dimensions individually or collectively relate to franchisor performance (Combs et al., 2011; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). This study addresses this research deficit by empirically showing not only the importance of distinguishing between multiple control alternatives in future inquiry, but also by differentiating between two dimensions of franchise system performance (i.e. efficiency and profitability/growth) and demonstrating how certain control mechanisms are selected over others to enhance franchise system performance. As advantages of franchising result mainly from its ability to exercise decision control (Heide, 1994; Stump & Heide, 1996; Weitz & Jap, 1995), our results show that franchisor’s authoritative control is contra-productive for the efficiency, profitability and growth of franchise systems. This may be due to several reasons including the growing strategic importance of franchisees to local knowledge creation and transfer (Windsperger, 2004). Franchisees’ autonomy with respect to supplier and equipment selection or product and procurement decisions is important to enhance customer responsiveness and innovations in networks (Kerim et al, 2018). However, we find that more equity control through higher proportion of owned outlets may lead to slight improvements in system’s efficiency, while bilateral forms of contractual and normative means to exercise decision control lead to higher system efficiency, profitability and growth.  Consistent with our theoretical conception of franchisor’s control capabilities, the findings demonstrate that the majority of control mechanisms, with the exception of authoritative control, can serve as transaction cost saving (Williamson 1975, 1985) and value-creation and relational-catalyst mechanisms (Barney 1991; Madhok 1996) as they facilitate knowledge transfer and mitigate appropriation and coordination cost concerns (Gulati and Singh 1998; Dekker 2004; Gulati et al. 2012). Specifically, consistent with the resource-based and relational governance perspectives, we highlight that using normative control to transfer system-knowhow and absorb local market knowhow, while exercising control of franchisee activities through contractual restraints, will enable the franchisor to generate relationship-specific rents by exploiting synergies in the franchise network (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Weitz and Jap, 1995). Both mechanisms of contractual and normative control have an additional important knowledge leverage function enhancing firm-specific resources and capabilities (Madhok, 1997; March, 1991) and hence increasing the overall network performance (Azoulay, and Shane, 2001). These strategies of exercising control possess additional coordination and safeguarding functions as they define roles, incentives and responsibilities and discourage franchisees from potential opportunism (Hajdini and Windpserger, 2019). This suggests that the franchisor will use a control level that considers the trade-off between the performance-enhancing effect of contractual and normative control mechanisms, and the performance-diminishing effect of authoritative control mechanisms. While we expected that contractual and normative control could spur the franchisor’s efficiency, profitability and growth, we also expected that equity and authoritative control could enhance both dimensions of the franchisor’s performance. One reason we did not find a stronger relationship between equity control and franchisor profitability/growth may be that managers of franchisor-owned outlets are less apt to generate entrepreneurial local know-how that sufficiently aid flexibility, and creation and diffusion of knowledge across the whole network outlets (El Akremi et al., 2011, Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001).  The study may offer additional impetus to alliance management capabilities research (e.g., Schilke and Goerzen, 2010; Schreiner et al., 2009) because it emphasizes the role of multiple control mechanism that franchisors develop to monitor and incentivize franchisees to joint-value creation and performance enhancement (Combs et al., 2011) something that the alliance literature has overlooked to mainly describe management capabilities and routines that improve  relationship quality of partners (Gillis, et al., 2020). In this line, future franchise studies may also examine the influence of multiple control mechanisms on partner relationship quality, conflicts and innovations.  In sum, we offer new insights to the literature of franchising by responding to recent calls for deeper investigation of managerial control as the major pillar of the governance structure of the firm (Combs et al., 2011; Dant and Grünhagen, 2014; Dant et al., 2011; Hajdini et al., 2017; Liu et al. 2014; Zhao et al., 2004).  Implications of limitations for future inquiry We have to acknowledge that our study has some limitations that have implications for future research. First, although we have derived primary data from franchisors with questionnaires designed specifically for the research question, our study is cross-sectional, which reinforces the need to develop and test our claims with secondary data. More observations that could span into the past could alleviate concerns of endogeneity and provide more information for sectorial/industrial effects. For example, the symbiosis perspective indicates that one advantage of franchisor outlet ownership is that it gives the franchisor more market information, which can assist personnel training and increase standardization (Bradach, 1997), both of which may be important for franchise systems with mobile customers (Brickley and Dark, 1987) and for those systems that depend on brand advertising (Lafontaine and Shaw, 2005) (e.g., retailing or fast food franchise systems), however, contractual and normative control may be more appropriate for franchise systems that need to locally adapt to customer needs (e.g., consulting or real estate franchise systems). Hence, adopting a systemic approach that investigates the role of local cultures, and the role of business and corporate franchisor strategies to using multiple control mechanisms might be a fruitful avenue for future scholars.  Second, while our findings pertain generally to whether franchise firms use one of the multiple control modes, they do not deal with different ways franchising is implemented, such as through area development, multi-unit or master franchising. Although we did not find any evidence that multi-unit franchising impacts performance, and that this could be more evident in international franchising, this or other franchising entry and governance modes could influence franchise management controlling capabilities and relatedly franchisor performance (Jell-Ojober and Windsperger, 2014). Third, while our measures are subjective in nature given that most franchise chains are privately held and do not publicly disclose information (Combs et al., 2011), future scholars might find indirect ways to investigate governance relationships among public franchise systems, a sub-set of population that may or may not represent the much larger population of smaller in size privately-owned franchise chains (Madanoglu et al., 2011). Finally, while we account for the resources/capabilities and relational bonds among franchise partners assessing the performance effect of different control machinimas, future scholars might find that certain mechanisms can have mediating or moderating effects on network performance contingent on the expertise or knowledge of franchise partners (Hajdini et al., 2017).  Conclusion  Given that franchising grows through a network of distant and independent entrepreneurs, it exposes its brand to risks of free-riding. As a result, the franchisor faces challenges related to the strategic design and use of multiple control mechanisms. Designing contracts that restrict and guide the partnership with respect to dealing, territorial exclusivity, resale price maintenance or tying is one way to alleviate free-riding and maintain standardization. While, authoritative control on different value chain activities of the franchisees shows to hinder performance, exercising normative control through successive trustworthy collaboration is another important alternative to enhance both dimensions of franchisor performance (i.e. efficiency, and profitability/growth). An additional approach to increase equity control through a higher proportion of franchisor-owned outlets has shown to marginally, but still increase one dimension of franchisor performance (e.g. savings in administrative, coordination and control costs). Therefore, we portrayed four franchise control mechanisms that illustrate some important governance routines and provided evidence that they serve as an important approach to network management and franchisor performance. Further, we demonstrate that the distinction between performance dimensions as well as multiple control dimensions is an important contribution to the practice and theory of franchising. This approach moves away from rather restrictive focus on singular control dimension toward a view that embraces the use of multiple control strategies to govern hybrid structures of franchise firms. Our hope is that this research offers a small step toward describing the control dimensions that franchisors can use to enhance their capabilities in working with local franchisee-entrepreneurs and enhance the performance of the overall chain. \n",

Multi-brand franchisees (MBFs) are franchisees who operate outlets within more than one franchise chain. The presence of this phenomenon seems to challenge most of the established theoretical arguments in franchising, especially those emerging from power-dependence and agency theories. In our attempt to enhance our understanding of this complex, emergent phenomenon, we argue that an appropriate theoretical perspective for explaining this phenomenon is one that, prima facie, appears to clash with it the most – agency theory. So, we use agency theory in an integrated mode – one that utilizes the full capacity of the theory and in which both components of the theory (the motivation problem and the ability problem) coexist and involve a tradeoff. Drawing on this integrated, dynamic agency theory perspective, we advance the “ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis” as a theoretical explanation for the emergence of multi-brand franchisees.  Keywords:Multi-brand Franchisees, Agency Theory, International Franchising, Ability-Motivation Tradeoff, Institutional Uncertainty.MULTI-BRAND FRANCHISEES: AN INTEGRATED AGENCY THEORY PERSPECTIVE  P a g e  | 3 INTRODUCTION Franchising is a form of distribution under which a focal party (the franchisor) grants other parties (the franchisees) the legal rights to sell its products and use its trademarks and business processes (for a certain period of time and within well-defined geographic areas) in exchange for a one-time upfront fee, known as the franchise fee, and an on-going share of revenues, known as the royalty rate (Blair & Lafontaine, 2005; Combs et al., 2004). One of the primary economic intuitions behind franchising is to allow the franchisor to achieve the outcomes of vertical integration through contractual vertical restraints without the need to own the entire channel, and to convince end-users that they are buying from the manufacturer when, in fact, they are dealing with a separately-owned enterprise (Stern et al., 1996). This channel structure results in a franchise chain consisting of a centralized principal (franchisor) and a group of decentralized agents (franchisees) within which there is a clear contractual distribution of rights and responsibilities.  LITERATURE REVIEW AND GAP IDENTIFICATION Franchising is a ubiquitous form of distribution and a part of consumers’ everyday life in almost every B2C sector all around the globe. About one-third of all retail sales in the U.S. move across franchise chains and this proportion is growing (e.g., Luxenberg, 1985; Mathewson & Winter, 1985; Dicke, 1992). Franchising accounts for over $1 trillion in annual sales and constitutes 17% of the United States’ GDP (Gillis et al., 2014). This ontological omnipresence is matched by a well-deserved amount of scholarly attention to the phenomenon that has resulted in a substantial body of knowledge traversing various disciplines such as entrepreneurship (e.g., Hoy & Shane, 1998; Bates, 1998; Gillis et al., 2014; Gassenheimer, 1996; Barthélemy, 2011), economics (e.g., Bhattacharyya & Lafontaine, 1995; Lafontaine, 1992; Martin, 1988; Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004; Blair & Lafontaine, 2005; Klein & Saft, 1985), finance (e.g., Klein, 1995; Brickley & Dark, 1987;  Lutz, 1995; Lafontaine & P a g e  | 4 Bhattacharyya, 1995; Norton, 1995), accounting (e.g., Campbell & Sandino, 2009; Price, 1999), strategic management (e.g., Ater & Rigbi, 2015; Combs & Ketchen, 2003; Norton, 1988; Michael, 2000; Perryman & Combs, 2012), and marketing (e.g., Hunt & Nevin, 1975; Agrawal, & Lal, 1995; Weaven & Frazer, 2003; Srinivasan, 2006; Windsperger & Dant, 2006). This interdisciplinary interest in franchising has led to the development of a rich, encompassing, and mature body of literature that covers most aspects of the phenomenon exhaustively: from the economic rationale underlying franchising (e.g., Combs & Ketchen, 2003; Knight, 1986; Norton, 1988; Lal, 1990; Lafontaine & Bhattacharyya, 1995; Lafontaine, 1992; Combs & Ketchen, 1999; Lafontaine & Kaufmann, 1994; Scott, 1995), to contracting in franchising (e.g., Agrawal & Lal, 1995; Brickley et al., 2006; Lafontaine & Bhattacharyya, 1995; Lafontaine & Shaw, 1999; Windsperger & Dant, 2006; Brickley et al., 2006; Rubin, 1978 ), to plural forms of governance in franchising (e.g., Bradach, 1997; Kidwell & Nygaard, 2011; Gillis et al., 2014; Dant et al., 2008; Bürkle & Posselt, 2008), to international franchising (e.g., Fladmoe-Lindquist, K., 1996; Welsh et al., 2006; Shane, 1996), to other emerging areas such as technology and innovation adoption in franchise chains (O'callaghan et al., 1992; Paswan & Wittmann, 2009).  One of the research areas in franchising that has attracted an ample amount of recent scholarly attention, is the phenomenon of multi-unit franchising. Multi-unit franchisees (MUF) are those who operate more than one unit (outlet) in the franchise chain (Dant et al., 2013). Franchisees become MUF by either acquiring other franchisees or by being granted an area development agreement under which they have the right to a certain geographic territory. The reason that multi-unit franchising stood out as a relatively intriguing phenomenon is that it defies one of the established theoretic underpinnings of franchising theory – the agency theoretic explanation of franchising. In this regard, Kalnins and Lafontaine (2004) argue that from an agency theory perspective, multi-unit franchising can be seen as an ‘anomaly’ for the following reasons: (a) the agency theory rationale for franchising is that owner-operators have less incentive to shirk. Hence, when a franchisor allocates multiple units to a franchisee, P a g e  | 5 that franchisee will not have the same level of involvement in day-to-day operations as in the case of single unit franchising and will be relying on agents (managers); (b) a set of single-unit franchisees will collectively have more incentive than a multi-unit franchisee; (c) when a single-unit franchisee becomes a multi-unit franchisee, he will have more bargaining power vis-à-vis the franchisor which can increase his opportunistic behavior. This questioning of the agency theoretic logic for franchising, as well as other theoretic explanations such as the power-dependence theory and the entry-deterrence argument (Hadfield, 1991), compelled many researchers to delve into the phenomenon of MUF which resulted in a substantial stack of academic literature on the subject (e.g., Kaufmann & Dant, 1996; Jindal, 2011; Bradach, 1995; Dant et al., 2013; Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004).  While attempting to reconcile what Bradach (1995) calls “chains within chains” or what Dant et al. (2013) call “mini-hierarchies within the franchise hierarchy” (i.e. MUF) with franchising theory, researchers largely overlooked an arguably more challenging and interesting phenomenon: multi-brand franchisees involving franchisees who operate outlets within more than one franchise chain (MBFs). The unresolved question here is that if researchers were intrigued by the presence of “chains within chains” or “mini-hierarchies within the hierarchy”, why have they largely overlooked what we would call “chains across chains” orchains-spanning hierarchies,” if we were to follow the Bradach and Dant analogies presented earlier? One possible reason is that MBFs may have a more long standing and visible presence in emerging markets than in developed markets where much of the scholarly research in franchising is conducted. That being said, even the international franchising literature is relatively silent on this phenomenon -- with rare exceptions such as Grünhagen et al. (2020). MBFs tend to be large business groups holding several franchises that are sometimes close substitutes or even direct competitors -- some American MBFs (e.g., Kazi Management VI LLC., Boddie-Noell Enterprises Inc., Pilot Travel Centers LLC., and Doherty Enterprises Inc.) hold more than 20 units of directly competing franchises such as Burger King, KFC, and Taco Bell). In this article, we try to scratch the surface of P a g e  | 6 this under-researched phenomenon by providing some exploratory theoretic insights. In doing so, we attempt to answer the following questions:  (a) If multi-unit franchising (MUF) is considered as a phenomenon that challenges the basic rationale for franchising, what would be the economic rationale that justifies the existence of multi-brand franchisees (MBFs)?  (b)  If the conventional setup in franchising is a powerful, central franchisor surrounded by a large chain of highly-dependent single/multi-unit franchisees, why would a large franchisor (principal) such as KFC, Starbucks, IHop, Zara, H&M, or Burger King agree to grant exclusive franchise rights to a franchisee (agent), who will not grant him back any exclusivity and may even sell close substitutes or competing brands?  (c) Given the argument made by Lafontaine and Kalnins (2004) that “The problem in these cases is that a franchisee’s ownership of multiple units within a market reduces his incentives to behave as aggressively as a set of single-unit franchisees would”, why would a franchisor  strategically and rationally decide to be just one-among-many franchisors in a smaller company’s portfolio and accept to compete with other franchisors for a limited pool of organizational resources rather than being the only business for a small, ambitious entrepreneur who lives on that business?  The remainder of this article is organized as follows: first, we establish the MBF phenomenon by giving examples and illustrations. Second, we survey the different theoretical lenses used by researchers in various disciplines to study franchising. Third, we reflect on the application of agency theory in channels and franchising research and highlight its major predictions. Fourth, we use a novel,  Empirical assessment in progress. P a g e  | 7 integrated agency theory perspective to offer a conceptual framework and theoretical hypotheses for explaining the MBF phenomenon. Fifth, we highlight the contributions of this article to theory and practice. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.   MULTI-BRAND FRANCHISEES (MBFs): THE PHENOMENON A franchisee is called a multi-brand franchisee if he operates outlets within more than one franchise chain, in contrast to a multi-unit franchisee who operates more than one outlet within the same franchise chain. An MBF’s portfolio of franchises may contain non-competing franchises (e.g. KFC and GAP), close substitute franchises (McDonald’s and Subway), or even rival franchises (McDonald’s and Burger King). Even though MBFs are present in developed markets, they are more likely to be visible in emerging markets. Emerging market MBFs are often large business groups that have multi-industry exposure, several divisions, and a highly diversified business model. Table 1 presents some MBF examples in the US, Middle East, India, and Philippines.The crux of the economic logic for franchising is to enable the franchisor to achieve the outcomes of vertical integration without the need to vertically-integrate the chain (Stern et al., 1996). This makes franchising, as is the case with most decentralized distribution arrangements, replete with agency relationships among extant exchange partnersup and down (vertical agency between the franchisor and franchisees via shirking) as well as right and left (horizontal agency among franchisees through free riding). Hence, it is no surprise that agency theory is “by far the most common explanation of franchising” (Perryman & Combs, 2012).                                                                     Storholm and Scheuing (1994) list various aspects of moral hazard and opportunism in franchising relations. From the franchisor side, a franchisor may: (1) terminate the franchise agreement of a productive franchisee to open a franchisor-owned outlet at the same location, (2) force the franchisee to buy inputs from one of his partners or subsidiaries, (3) write the franchise contract in a way that renders the franchisee vulnerable in legal disputes, (4) misappropriate advertising royalties and place franchiseP a g e  | 8 Table 1 outlets at a proximity to each other. On the other side, a franchisee can harm a franchisor by: (1) exposing the franchisor’s proprietary information, (2) not abiding by quality standards, and (3) not paying royalties on time.  MBFs can create acute tensions in almost every aspect in the aforementioned list. For instance, the first point of friction with agency theory is the voluntary dilution of dependence by the franchisor. The central thesis in franchising theory is the elimination of double-sided moral hazard (shirking) by aligning the franchisee’s incentive with that of the franchisor via the residual claim mechanism P a g e  | 9 (Norton, 1988; Rubin 1987) under which the franchisee as a rational, utility maximizing agent is self-motivated to allocate his “maximum effort” to the franchise unit(s) he operates. On the other side, the franchisor invests in the brand to keep the royalty revenue healthy and flowing (Lal, 1990; Lafontine 1992). In the case of MBFs, the double-sided moral hazard rationale for franchising potentially fails because an MBF has a limited set of managerial, entrepreneurial, and financial resources that should be optimally allocated across a portfolio of franchise brands in order to maximize the joint profit of the business enterprise. Hence, the same rational, utility maximizing agent -- who in the case of single-unit franchising allocates his “maximum effort” to the outlet he is living on -- ends up allocating an optimal effort” to each one of the franchises in his portfolio. What can make this less palatable for a franchisor is the logical argument that new arrivals (recent franchises) in an MBF’s portfolio often cannot outstrip the incumbent successful franchises (which are already fueling the growth of the MBF and are naturally financially and emotionally dearer to the MBF) in their competition for the MBF’s limited organizational resources.  A second point of tension between the agency theory rationale for franchising and the MBF phenomenon could be the MBF’s reluctance to buy inputs from the franchisor’s designated suppliers. The MBF’s argument here could be that economies of scale and his existing supplier relationships in the local market can offer him more competitive prices. A third source of friction between the agency theory rationale (as applied in the franchising context) and the MBF phenomenon is the legal resources at the disposal of the MBF that enable him to better deal with legalities and disputes with the franchisor. A fourth source of friction between the agency theory rationale for franchising and the MBF phenomenon is the knowledge transfer that is likely to occur among the different franchises in the MBF's portfolio. One of the main drivers of the success of a franchise is its proprietary processes and knowledge i.e., the so-called “secrets of the trade”. Most of those processes and information are intangible and almost impossible to effectively protect contractually. The MBF at the end of the day is interested in the “joint profit” maximization of his portfolio of franchises which gives him a strong, P a g e  | 10 rational incentive for knowledge transfer between franchises, and he will likely do so. The fifth point of friction between the agency theory rationale for franchising and the MBF phenomenon is the re-emergence of vertical agency risks. The most basic proposition in franchising is that an owner-manager will not shirk while the employee-manager will shirk. In an MBF setting, this completely fails because the franchisee (an MBF) tends to be relatively isolated from the outlet(s) via layers of bureaucracy such as division heads, brand managers, and outlet managers.  In addition to the aforementioned tensions between the MBF phenomenon and the agency theory rationale for franchising, tensions also exist between the MBF phenomenon and other theoretical rationales for franchising.  For example, consider the power-dependence argument for franchising (Frazier & Summers, 1986; Tikoo, 2002; Michael, 2000). Here, a franchisor achieves the equivalent of a hierarchical governance structure via an unbalanced power equation and unidirectional rigorous contracting (Antia & Frazier, 2001). The reasoning here is straight forward: franchising is a game of control in which the franchisor can exercise the same level of control over its franchisees as that in a vertically integrated channel. This control arises from the degree of dependence that a franchisee has on that franchisor. In an MBF setting, the franchisee (MBF) is typically less dependent on the franchisor. Indeed, there may be situations where there is interdependence asymmetry, but the direction is reversed -- the franchisor is relatively more dependent on the franchisee (MBF). In light of the arguments presented above, it would be a fair argument to contend that the phenomenon of multi-brand franchisees (MBF) is one that seems to defy most of our extant franchising theory. In this article, we attempt to explore an appropriate theoretical framework that could explain the MBF phenomenon and reconcile it with existing franchising theory. Our starting point is a survey of the theoretical lenses that have shaped our scholarly understanding of franchising. P a g e  | 11 THEORETIC LENSES IN FRANCHISING THEORY Franchising is a heavily researched topic that spans multiple disciplines. The interdisciplinary nature of franchising research has led to great diversity in the theoretic lenses used to examine the phenomenon since each discipline brings with it a different theoretic toolkit. Some of the earliest inquiries into franchising as a form of distribution were in marketing with Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1969) advancing the resource scarcity thesis as the first theoretic logic for franchising. Other scholars (Katz & Joel, 1992; Thompson, 1994; Shane, 1996; Gillis & Combs, 2009) deepened and broadened this logic to establish resource scarcity as one of the leading theoretic paradigms for examining franchising. The main argument here is that franchising is a mechanism for accessing financial and managerial resources to achieve quick expansion. Economics scholars attempted to understand franchising as an efficientform of governance. Two notable surveys of the literature (Lafontaine & Slade, 1997; Dnes, 1996) identified agency theory as the main theoretic lens for franchising. Resource scarcity and agency theories, along with the associated theories such as signaling theory (Dant & Kaufmann, 2003) and the resource-based view (Mariz‐Pérez & García‐Álvarez, 2009; Gillis et al., 2014), seem to be the  dominant theoretic views in franchising research. That being said, other theoretic frameworks were employed by researchers in marketing, entrepreneurship, and strategy such as the transaction cost theory (Michael, 2000), property rights theory (Windsperger & Dant, 2006), and institutional theory (Shane & Foo, 1999).  After a careful contemplation of all existing theoretic lenses in the franchising literature, we found that the best theory to explain the MBF phenomenon is perhaps the theory that appears to clash with the most: agency theory. To reconcile the MBF phenomenon with agency theory, we first review the existing predictions of agency theory in the franchising literature, which are primarily drawn from the motivation component (moral hazard) in the theory. Then we employ agency theory in a novel way that enables it to explain the MBF phenomenon without the support of any other theory or a change to any of its assumptions or boundaries. To do so, we adopt a more integrative approach to agency theory. P a g e  | 12 An approach that simultaneously activates both components of the agency theory: the motivation (moral hazard) component and the ability (adverse selection) component to create a more comprehensive theoretic perspective. In the next section, we review the applications of agency theory in the distribution channels and franchising research. AGENCY THEORY IN CHANNELS RESEARCH Agency theory uses the contract metaphor to represent a relationship in which one party (principal) delegates a task to another (agent) in an asymmetric information setting and under uncertainty (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Whenever a principal decides to enter into a contractual relationship with an agent, the principal will face two types of problems: (a) pre-contractual problems (aka hidden information problems) related to whether the agent has the characteristics the principal is looking for and how the principal can verify that before entering into the contractual relationship ; (b) post-contractual problems (aka as hidden actions problems) related to how the principal can assess and reward the performance of the agent to motivate him to act in a way that maximizes the principal’s outcome (Bergen et al., 1992).  Economists often refer to the hidden information and hidden action problems as the adverse selection and moral hazard problems respectively. In this article, we draw on the terminology used by Banerjee and colleagues and refer to the adverse selection problem as the ability problem and to moral hazard problem as the motivation problem (Banerjee et al., 2012).  The focal agency assumptions which apply to both problems are: (1) both parties are rational utility maximizers driven by self-interest, (2) task delegation takes place under asymmetric information where the agent is more informed, (3) realized outcomes depend on exogenous environmental uncertainty, and (4) the agent is risk averse whereas the principal is risk neutral (Bergen et al., 1992). With few exceptions, agency theory has often been employed to tackle one agency problem at a time, either the pre-contractual P a g e  | 13 abilityproblem or the post-contractual motivationproblem. This resulted in two dominant modes of operation for agency theory in the channels literature: the motivation mode and the ability mode. The Motivation Mode: The most common mode of agency theory in channels research is the moral hazard or the motivation mode. The main problem here is that the principal and the agent have conflicting goals: it is optimal for the risk averse agent to shirk and exert the minimal effort that keeps him in the job, whereas the principal’s goal is to maximize his outcome, which is a function of the agent’s effort. To mitigate this motivation problem, principals can choose between two courses of action: (a) Behavior-based compensation systems: under such systems, the principal invests in monitoring systems and mechanisms, monitors the agent’s behavior, and relies on contracts that define the agent’s compensation as a function of his observedeffort i.e., compensation= f (observed effort)or (b) avoid monitoring costs (and other agency costs) and design a contract that motivates the agent to exert his maximum effort by defining his compensation as a function of realized outcomes rather than observed effort while offering incentives that align both parties goals i.e., “compensation = f (realized outcome).” So, on the part of the principal, the core of the motivation problem is to design a contract that provides an efficient monitoringcost – incentive tradeoff (Eisenhardt, 1989; Ross, 1973; Bergen et al., 1992). The Ability Mode: Substantially less common in the channels literature is the application of the adverse selection mode of the agency theory. The main problem here is that is the principal knows the traits that the agent must possess to be able to effectively perform the tasks that the principal will delegate to him. However, the principal doesn’t know precisely whether the agent he is hiring actually possesses those required traits since those traits are the agent’s hidden informationEconomic theory suggests three primary mechanisms to mitigate the ability problem: one by the agent and two by the principal. An able agent (a productive employee who meets the job P a g e  | 14 requirements) invests in some activities that signal his traits to the principal and distinguish him from the unable agent (a less productive employee who does not meet the job requirements). Thus, the principal observes the agent’s signal and becomes more informed which mitigates the information asymmetry issue and consequently the ability problem. Examples include the investment in educational degrees by job market candidates (see Spence’s 1973 seminal article) or the investment in acquiring safe driving certificates in the auto insurance market. The economics literature offers two mechanisms for the principal to tackle the ability problem. First, screening, where the principal invests in some ability assessment mechanisms such as job interviews, job exams, reference letters, or other information gathering activities. Agency costs manifest themselves here in the form of screening and assessment costs that creates inefficiencies. Second, self-selection, where the principal designs contracts that entice unable agents to select themselves out. Examples here are insurance policies with high deductibles or job offers that require rigorous training and performance assessment during probation periods. The Integrated Mode: The vast majority of the channels literature, as well as the marketing and perhaps management literature, activates a single mode of agency theory: the motivation or the ability mode. A notable exception in the economics literature is Picard’s (1987) work in which he examined incentive schemes designing in a world with both adverse selection and moral hazard. We refer to this mode as the integratedmodeof agency theory. In his work, Picard suggests a “menu of quadratic incentive schemes” as a mechanism for reducing both moral hazard and adverse selection simultaneously. Hence, Picard models adverse selection and moral hazard as two parallel frictional forces pulling in the same direction away from the desired efficiency point, and the objective is to enhance efficiency by reducing the impact of both forces simultaneously. Other exceptions include Grünhagen, Zheng, & Wang (2017) in the franchising literature, Perryman and Combs (2012) in the channels literature, and Raassens et al. (2012) in the new product development literature. P a g e  | 15 The Integrated Antiparallel Mode: In this article, we apply agency theory in a way that not only uses the integrated agency theory mode (as in Picard’s case), but also models moral hazard and adverse selection as two antiparallel frictional forces that are pulling performance away from the target efficiency point in opposite directions. The challenging situation here is that unlike Picard’s case (in which the principal could take a single action that mitigates both adverse selection and moral hazard), the situation involves a tradeoff such that when you reduce the threat of one agency problem, you increase the threat of the other. The objective then becomes to reduce the overall inefficiency by identifying the optimaltradeoff between the two frictional forces. We call this mode the Integrated Antiparallel Mode of agency theory. So, whereas the integrated parallel mode presents adverse selection and moral hazard as two frictional forces pulling away from the desired efficiency point in the same direction, the integrated antiparallel mode presents them as two frictional forces pulling away from the target efficiency each in a different directionFigure 1 presents a simple graphical and mathematical intuition for the four aforementioned modes of operation of agency theory:P a g e  | 16 In the next section, we present a brief summary of the applications of agency theory in franchising research. Then, we advance our conceptual framework and propose the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis as an agency theoretic explanation for the MBF phenomenon and a more integrative application of agency theory in franchising research, especially in markets with high institutional uncertainty.AGENCY THEORY APPLICATIONS IN FRANCHISING Along with resource scarcity theory, agency theory has shaped most of our theorizing in franchising. Table 2 presents a representative summary of the main agency arguments in franchising. P a g e  | 17 Table 2 Theoretic Argument Representative  Literature Agency Mode Franchising is an effective governance structure that minimizes vertical agency costs (costs of monitoring and incentivizing managers) through the residual claim mechanism that substitutes incentives for monitoring costs and aligns the interests of both the principal (franchisor) and the agent (franchisee) and eradicates shirking.  (The Vertical Single-sided Agency Thesis). Rubin, 1978;  Bradach, 1997 Moral Hazard Franchising enhances exchange efficiency by reducing opportunism on both sides of the dyad via an effective revenue mix (franchise fee, royalty rate) that aligns both parties’ incentives and balances risk with reward.  (The Vertical Double-sided Agency Thesis) Lafontaine, 1992;  Klein, 1995;  Lafontaine & Bhattacharyya, 1995 Moral Hazard Plural governance, which is the maintenance of a mix of owned outlets and franchised outlets within the franchise chain, is a governance device that mitigates horizontal agency costs (free-riding among franchisees that leads to under-investment in the brand and quality decline). Franchisors own focal outlets at vital locations to maintain brand quality and franchise less vital outlets. Also, franchisors own close outlets and franchise distant ones because the costs of monitoring nearby outlets are affordable.  (The Horizontal Single-sided Agency Thesis) Brickley & Dark, 1987; Norton, 1988; Caves & Murphy, 1976 Moral Hazard In a franchising relationship, both parties (franchisor, franchisee) are subject to dual agency i.e., (a) adverse selection where both parties may misrepresent themselves before entering into the contractual relationship, and (b)moral hazard where both parties may act opportunistically after entering into the contractual relationship. (The Vertical Dual Agency Thesis) Grünhagen, Zheng,    & Wang, 2017 Moral Hazard  & Adverse  Selection CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND THEORETICAL HYPOTHESISAs evident in the table above, as well as in the broader franchising literature, moral hazard, or the motivationproblem, is the main mode of operation of agency theory in franchising research. In our examination of multi-brand franchisees, we rely on the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory in which moral hazard and adverse selection are present and pulling the firm’s performance away from its desired efficiency point but each in a different direction i.e., acting as antiparallel frictional forces. P a g e  | 18 The role of uncertainty in the agency theory is a focal one and, as underscored earlier, environmental uncertainty is a major assumption in the theory.  Swift, successful chain expansion is at the heart of the franchising logic, and franchisors are always under increasing competitive pressures to expand because chain size offers economies of scale, bargaining power in both directions of the supply chain, wider portfolio of entrepreneurial, financial and intellectual capabilities, higher brand awareness, spatial preemption of competition, and greater advertising leverage (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1969; Katz & Joel, 1992; Thompson, 1994; Shane, 1996; Gillis & Combs, 2009). This is arguably the crux of the resource scarcity thesis. International expansion of a franchise system takes the aforesaid capabilities and efficiencies to a new level by bringing in a distinctive, dynamic, and diverse array of resources (Fladmoe-Lindquist, 1996; El Akremi et al., 2015), especially when the local market is moving towards saturation. Notwithstanding that, the mortality rates of franchise systems can be high, and the survival of a franchise system is highly dependent on the age and size of the chain among other factors (Stern et al., 1996; Shane & Foo, 1999). This makes entry to a new market, especially an emerging one, a very risky, yet a strategic, decision that requires deep deliberation and far-sighted risk-benefit assessment.  The gap between the number of MBFs in emerging markets in comparison to developed markets suggests the presence of some unique forces in emerging markets that drift the franchise manager away from the conventional “stylized facts” in franchising, which assume no presence of MBFs, or at most a very rationed presence, within the chain. Burgess and Steenkamp (2006) argue that emerging markets “present significant departures from the assumptions of theories developed in the Western world that challenge our conventional wisdom.” In their article, Burgess and Steenkamp conduct an extensive comparison between the two business environments over three institutional dimensions: socioeconomic, regulative, and cultural. In brief, they highlight that the socioeconomic environment in emerging markets is considerably more dynamic and more demographically diverse (income, education, household size, human development level) than in advanced markets. The cultural P a g e  | 19 environment is characterized by a high degree of social embeddedness and hierarchical authority structures. The regulative environment is characterized by higher stakeholders’ influence on governance, greater abuse of public/corporate office power, less efficacy of the rule-of-law, lower investor rights, and higher regulatory instability (for a detailed discussion see Burgess and Steenkamp, 2006). These factors make the level of institutional uncertainty in emerging markets much higher than that in developed markets. These considerations suggest the following. First, franchising researchers relied extensively on the motivationmode of the agency theory because most of our franchise research was conducted in the developed world, mainly the U.S., where (a) the availability and reliability of objective, standardized ability assessment techniques such as credit ratings, certifications, educational degrees, and recommendations, (b) the effectiveness of misrepresentation and unethical behavior laws, and (c) the relatively little abuse of public/corporate office power discount the anxiety about the ability problem and directs the franchise manager’s attention to the motivation problemSecond, franchising researchers have overlooked the moderating role of institutional uncertainty due to the familiarity of franchise managers, in developed markets, with the socioeconomic, cultural, and regulative systems, and the availability of meaningful data that allows practical levels of predictability and little institutional uncertainty. This logic does not hold in emerging markets.  Third, the overwhelming institutional uncertainty in emerging markets makes ability the main concern for the franchise manager because its effect on performance is much higher than that of motivation. Under highly uncertain environments, a decision maker is typically more concerned about macro uncertainty (socioeconomic, cultural, regulative) than micro uncertainty (shirking). Hence, he becomes rationally more willing to trade motivation off for ability. Ability in emerging markets takes the form of organizational resources, legitimacy, size, relational capabilities, marketing capabilities, and the likes. So, institutional uncertainty moderates the ability-performance link positively and the motivation-performance link negatively because environmental uncertainty reduces the effectiveness of motivation (keeping in mind that the agent is risk averse).  P a g e  | 20 Fourth, emerging markets necessitate the use of the integrated mode of agency theory, in which both ability and motivation are present and where uncertainty plays a central moderating role; specifically, the antiparallel version. Why the antiparallel, not the parallel mode? In franchising the concept of motivation is simply a dependence game in which the franchisor (principal) motivates the franchisee (agent) to exert his maximum effort through the residual claim mechanism. Since the franchisee is often highly dependent on his franchise outlet (often living on it), this will be very effective. In emerging markets, and mainly for MBFs, ability and motivation tend to move in opposite directions where the more able the candidate the harder it is to motivate him. The intuition here is very simple and straightforward: think of the reservationutility in the classic microeconomic principal-agent model in which to entice an agent to exert a desired level of effort, the principal must make sure that his contract satisfies both the individual rationality and the incentive conditions. Within the same model, we assume that the higher the ability of the agent, the higher his reservation utility, and thus a higher incentive is required. Another basic intuition here is the following example. Think of a franchise outlet that produces an annual net income of $250,000 and is owned by a mom-and-pop or by two young entrepreneurs, and imagine the level of commitment and motivation that the owners will have. On the other hand, the same $250,000 would be less significant on the income statement of a large, diversified MBF enterprise and would constitute a much lower motivation. So, the basic economics of incentives suggest that motivation is directly proportional to dependence, whereas dependence is inversely proportional to ability. This provides the intuition behind the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory used in this article in which both the ability problem and motivation problem pull the franchisor away from his target efficiency point but in opposite directions. Based on the above four arguments we present our ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis (H1)as a theoretic explanation for the multi-brand franchisees phenomenon. Our conceptual framework is depicted in figure 2. P a g e  | 21 : As institutional uncertainty (socioeconomic, cultural, and regulative) increase, franchisors are more willing to trade motivation off for ability. For suggestions on how to empirically test the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis, please consult the section “suggestions for future empiricalresearch”towards the end of the article.                   Figure 2 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEORY Franchising researchers have investigated numerous governance issues: from the classic general ones such as vertical and horizontal integration to the more recent and idiosyncratic ones such as multi-unit franchising, ownership redirection, and dual distribution or plural governance. Nonetheless, scholarship has largely overlooked multi-brand franchisees. A notable exception here is Grünhagen et al. (2020) who examined the multi-brand franchisees phenomenon from a franchisee’s perspective.  Empirical assessment in progress. P a g e  | 22 They advance an evolutionary laddered-diversification explanation for the MBF phenomenon (from the franchisee perspective) where franchisees evolve over time into multi-unit franchisees and eventually into MBF as they accumulate franchising experience -- the motive is mitigating the risk of their business portfolio. This leaves a gap in our understanding of franchising governance and calls for some research attention. In this modest effort, we attempt to fill this gap and contribute to the extant, rich franchising literature by providing some novel theoretic insights into this thought-provoking phenomenon, which is rampant in emerging markets but less visible, though present, in developed markets (see table 1). This research departs from existing work on the MBF phenomenon (Grünhagen et al., 2020) by: (a) taking the franchisor’s perspective to the phenomenon -- a perspective that involves greater focus on interorganizational tensions, and (b) examining the franchisor’s strategic, conscious decision to trade off one agency problem for another when entering into a relationship with an MBF (vs. the more evolutionary and gradual diversification perspective and approach of the franchisee).  For the lay observer, multi-brand franchisees (MBF) constitute an empirical anomaly that defies the primary logic in franchising - the agency framework. Thus, he sees MBFs as the result of some circumstantial, ad hoc managerial decisions that are at best naïve or maybe irrational. For the impatient observer, MBFs are an interesting phenomenon that needs to find a theoretic house, but agency theory does not appear to be that house due to the high level of friction between the phenomenon and the theory. However, for the discerning researcher, MBFs are one of the most intriguing manifestations of agency theory that does not violate any agency assumption but requires the full capacity of the theory to address its empirical complexity. In addition to our contribution to the franchising literature, we contribute to the information economics literature by operating agency theory in a novel mode that, to the best of our knowledge, has never been applied in the literature before: the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory. It is by no means an extension of, an extrapolation of, or addition to the theory. Every aspect in the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory is present in the classic agency theory and straightforwardly falls P a g e  | 23 within its theoretic boundaries. It is just a new angle for viewing a powerful, multifaceted theory that has influenced almost every discipline in social sciences. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Despite the fact that this study is predominantly a theoretical examination of an existing phenomenon, it provides a more integrative approach to understanding franchising that could inform practitioners and guide them in their decision-making process. Franchising is not merely a motivation game as most of the literature suggests. Rather, it is a complete agency game that involves both agency components, ability and motivation. Therefore, in situations with low institutional uncertainty, the franchise manager can focus more on the motivation component when designing a franchise contract because the ability component is less severe and manageable. In situations with moderate institutional uncertainty, a franchise manager should design a contract the tackles both problems at the same time as the two problems tend to be simultaneously manageable (the integrated parallel mode). On the other hand, in situations with high institutional uncertainty (e.g., emerging markets), a prudent franchise manager should be cognizant of the demanded ability-motivation tradeoff that is sometimes unavoidable when entering turbulent institutional environments and should make his decision accordingly. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH Science philosophers have noted that science advances through an induction–deduction cyclewithin which a researcher observes some interesting empirical phenomenon, theorizes about it (the induction stage), and advances a refutable proposition. Then, another researcher(s) contemplates this proposition, derives some testable hypotheses from it, collects some meaningful data, and subjects the hypotheses to empirical testing (the deduction stage). This empirical testing leads to an affirmation or disconfirmation of the proposition, which in both cases induces extensions to the thesis or alternative P a g e  | 24 explanations (back again to the induction stage) and so on and so forth. This article is an initial attempt to scratch the surface of a complex phenomenon that at the first sight defies the basic arguments in franchising theory. Rigorous empirical testing of the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis is needed to probe further into this phenomenon and advance our knowledge through the affirmation/disconfirmation induction. Here are few suggestions on how to empirically test the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesisa)  Collecting data from one giant U.S. franchise chain such as Burger King or Dunkin Donuts (to control for cross-chain variations) and testing whether the aggregate number of brands held by all chain members in the U.S. is lower than the aggregate number of brands held by all chain members in the U.K., which is lower than the aggregate number of brands held by all chain members in India or the United Arab Emirates. The intuition here is to use the U.K or some other EU country as a control since it lies between the U.S. and emerging markets in terms of institutional uncertainty.  Conducting qualitative research using in-depth interviews with franchise managers asking about situations under which they opt for an MBF vs. a single brand franchisee. (c)  Conducting conjoint analysis, along the lines of Murry and Heide’s (1998) study, where researchers present to franchise managers a series of scenarios in which there are different (franchisee ability, franchisee motivation, institutional uncertainty) combinations, and examine their responses. By doing so, we can disentangle the tradeoff between the two concerns, ability and motivation, and the contingencies that govern this tradeoff.LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCHGerman Nobel laureate and the father of quantum physics, Max Planck, once said, “Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.” This article advances the P a g e  | 25 ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis as a theoretic explanation for the phenomenon of multi-brand franchisees. This does not rule out the existence of superior theoretic alternatives that could be more capable of explaining this phenomenon. A strong candidate is transaction cost analysis (TCA) coined by Coase (1937) and popularized by Williamson (1989, 1991). Agency theory and TCA, have much in common. Williamson himself stated that the two theories are “complementary” and help in understanding the economic organization. Under TCA, we can think of MBFs as an adaptation phenomenon in which the franchisor chooses the governance structure that provides him with the lowest adaptation costs in a highly uncertain environment where he has little asset specificity. Another strong theoretical candidate is the resource-based view of the firm coined by Wernerfelt (1984) and popularized by Barney (1991) and Makadok (2001). The main argument here is that the franchisor attempts to capitalize on the scope capability of the franchisee, which is very effective in highly turbulent markets that naturally call for such capability.CONCLUSION The case of multi-brand franchisees, who operate outlets within more than one franchise chain, is a thought-provoking one that at the first glance looks like an empirical anomaly or a rogue phenomenon that defies the predictions of the most established theories in franchising (mainly those coming from the agency theory or the power-dependence perspective). To advance our theoretical understanding of this complex phenomenon, we draw on the theory that it appears to clash with the most, agency theory, and operate this theory in a novel mode that utilizes the full capacity of the theory, a mode we call the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory, in which both components of the agency dilemma, the motivation problem and the ability problem, are present and involve a tradeoff. Drawing on this integrated, dynamic mode of agency theory, we advance the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis as the theoretic explanation for multi-brand franchisees. This hypothesis P a g e  | 26 argues that in markets with high institutional (socioeconomic, cultural, and regulative) uncertainty, such as emerging markets, franchise managers are more concerned about ability than motivation due to the high risk inherent in such volatile, complex business environments. Hence, they become more willing to trade off motivation for ability, which leads to partnering with more locally capable firms. This leads to the emergence of multi-brand franchisees. As a final thought, consider the effect of institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991) that leads to an amplification of this phenomenon where new entrants often imitate the behavior of their incumbent peers and incline more towards partnering with MBFs. This makes the phenomenon more prevalent and adds more legitimacy to its practice. P a g e  | 27 \n",

This case study is designed to facilitate an understanding of participants’ experience of the business model from different perspectives. It raises the complex problems and issues that can occur throughout the lifecycle of a business format franchise and is based on a real case.  Introduction Franchising is a dominant business strategy for the distribution of goods and services both domestically and internationally. Franchise operations are increasingly found nested within public and proprietary corporate groups. Retail Food Group (RFG) is a franchisor of 11 franchise brands (at August 2019): Brumby's Bakery, Michel's Patisserie, Donut King, Crust Gourmet Pizza, Pizza Capers, Gloria Jean's, Cafe2U, The Coffee Guy, BB's Café, Big Dad's Pies and Esquires Coffee. It is a global franchise and coffee business supported by a manufacturing and distribution division. Specialising in food and beverage the company is headquartered in Australia and has been listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) since 2006. It was trading at $7.49 per share in 2015, at 10 cents per share in January 2020 and $0.075 cents per share in March 2021. RFG requested a trading halt in November 2019, seeking funding through a $150m institutional placement. Problems for RFG range from  needing to keep diverse stakeholders (public company shareholders analysists and regulators) happy,  meeting statutory obligations to shareholders, supporting a rapidly growing network, addressing competition among competing brands and managing a high turnover of head office staff.  Changes in the corporate structure of the franchisor led to franchisees having a ‘new’ franchisor that implements different systems and provided different support than their original franchisor did.   On 14 March 2019, Australia’s Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on Corporations and Financial Services published its report ‘Fairness in Franchising’ into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct (Code). The PJC commented that \"the problems, including exploitation in certain franchise systems, are systemic\". It said that franchisors have been empowered to take advantage of franchisees under the current regulatory framework, with franchise agreements and the Code offering insufficient protection to franchisees. One sixth of the franchisee submissions made to the inquiry related to RFG. The PJC was particularly critical of RFG calling for three regulators to investigate its directors. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) regulates anti-competitive conduct, consumer protection issues under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and enforces the Franchising Code of Conduct. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulates compliance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) administers commonwealth taxation laws. The PJC was broadly critical of franchisors owned by private equity.  This case study is an opportunity to examines issues presented from three perspectives; a Gloria Jean’s franchisee, RFG as the franchisor and publicly listed company, and a junior accountant working at Retail Food Group’s head office. Both the perspective of the franchisee and junior accountant are general experience cases, created from franchisees ‘submissions to the 2018 PJC. Submissions to a PJC are made on oath and are protected by parliamentary privilege. The RFG perspective is a published information case, based on information sourced from the company’s annual reports, news articles, media release, submissions to the PJC, and the PJC’s final report.  Part I encompasses the franchisee’s perspective. The main objective is to understand the pre-contractual decision-making processes and due diligence activities undertaken by prospective franchisees. The franchisee’s perspective is also illustrative of the complex problems and issues that arise throughout the lifecycle of a business format franchise. Part II focuses on Retail Food Group in its role as franchisor. This section facilitates insights into decision-making from the perspective of both a franchisor and a publicly listed company. Finally, the experience of a junior accountant employed by the franchisor is provided. The issues facing this stakeholder centre on employment obligations, whistle-blowing activities, and organisation culture. Regulatory background The current multi-layered approach to regulation of the business model in Australia is delivered through the Competition and Consumer Act (2010) (CCA), a federal level industry-specific subordinate legislation called the Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 2014 (the Code),  and general commercial and contract  case law.The Franchise Council of Australia (FCA) is the industry body and a voluntary organisation, with membership open to any organisation or individual stakeholder. Relevant legislation  Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 20141. Gloria Jean’s franchisee  The case study is based on real events documented in submissions made by franchisees to the Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Inquiry into Franchising in 2018. A profile of a hypothetical Gloria Jean’s coffee shop franchisee has been created from the sum of these experiences. Real names of the franchisees and their store location have been changed for privacy purposes.  All details are sourced from the public record. 1.1 Specific issues The franchisees reflects on whether more due diligence at the beginning of their journey could have put them in a better decision to predict and prepare for the difficulties that could follow.   Are the current pre-contractual protections sufficient to protect franchisees from franchisors behaving opportunistically? In 2011, husband and wife, Maria Ferraro (aged 44) and Luigi Ferraro (aged 46), purchased their first business, a Gloria Jean’s franchised coffee shop. The couple had long discussed owning their own business but were worried that they did not have the business knowledge and skills required to build a successful business from scratch. Both had completed secondary education and neither had studied at a tertiary level. They each had more than 20 years’ experience working in and managing food and retail businesses. The idea of purchasing a proven business model, that came with ongoing support seemed perfect. The Ferraro’s attended a franchise trade fair and decided that they would like to become Gloria Jean’s franchisees.   Maria and Luigi entered into discussions with the Australian licensors for Gloria Jean’s, a proprietary company called Jireh International Pty Ltd (Jireh) trading as Gloria Jean’s Coffee. During the pre-contractual phase, the Ferraro’s were advised to speak with existing Gloria Jean’s franchisees about their stores and experiences. The names and contact details of the specific stores they were to speak with were provided by the sales consultant from Jireh. They also sought advice on the proposed investment from a solicitor and accountant. Having believed that they had undertaken the necessary due diligence, with no major objections or flaws pointed out by existing franchisees, or their solicitor or accountant, the Ferraro’s signed the franchise agreement in August 2011.  Their first outlet in a shopping centre opened in December 2011 and cost $450,000. This paid for the fit out, franchise fees, trademark fees and their opening stock. The franchisor negotiated a 7-year lease agreement that coincided with the 7-year franchise agreement. A further $20,000 was charged by the franchisor for Maria and Luigi to participate in a 2-week training program and $15,000 per year to the franchisor’s central advertising fund. Royalty fees were charged at 7% of gross annual turnover.  Reality began to set in for the Ferraro’s after 3 months of operating the store. According to Mr Ferraro “we discovered after only a few months of working in the store, that the profit and loss statements we were provided with were not a true reflection of the costs of running the business” adding further “it was at this point that we realised the Gloria Jean’s model we had to work with was well and truly broken.”  The problems with the business model were pervasive.  Within the first few months, the Ferraro’s began receiving additional bills from the shopping centre for opening their shop on weekends and public holidays, for centre security and cleaning costs. In the pre-contractual phase, the Gloria Jean’s head office had insisted on negotiating the lease directly with the shopping centre. The lease is in the name of the franchisor as head tenant.  This left the Ferraro’s without any power to renegotiate the terms of the lease, the costs they were paying each month and the additional expenses. When the Ferraro’s tried to approach the Gloria Jean’s head office lawyers about their concerns, they found them to be “non-reactive, inefficient and inexperienced”. Mr Ferraro recalls “many franchisees that I know of lost their stores as the head office lawyers did not negotiate lease requirements within the required timeframes, or came in after initial talks were held, and ending up have a lease that disadvantaged the franchisee.” The Ferraro’s were only allowed to purchase stock items from an approved list of suppliers provided by the Gloria Jean’s head office. The suppliers had ‘special’ prices for Gloria Jean’s franchisees, that were often higher than if an enquiry for the same product was made direct to the supplier by a franchisee posing as an “independent trader”.   Incentives from suppliers were not passed on to the franchisee. Instead, they were paid direct to the franchisor’s head office, as an additional source of revenue. The Ferraro’s found that they could buy Gloria Jean’s coffee beans cheaper at the supermarket than they could buy them through the head office. But they were not allowed to do this as it was a breach of their franchise agreement. Marketing fund fees were charged at 2% of net sales. However, Luigi and Maria struggled to see a return on their compulsory payments to this fund. Two years into operating their store, the advertising posters that had been displayed on their walls since their first day of trading remained, now faded and outdated. After approaching the head office, the couple were told that they could have new signage and artwork printed at their own expense. The selection would need to be made from a very limited number of options made available to them by the franchisor. Several times Maria and Luigi asked for the marketing fund profit and loss statement. These statements did not clearly state where any money had been spent on actual marketing campaigns. The main expenses coming out of the fund were wages, paid to a daughter of the franchisor’s director.  In 2012, a series of negative media revelations aimed at the Australian licensee, Jireh negatively affected Maria and Luigi’s customer base. It was exposed that the franchisor was a significant donor to the Australian Christian Lobby, and had affiliations with the Hillsong Church and Mercy Ministries.  An ongoing legal dispute between Jireh and its US coffee bean supplier Western Export Services (WES) in 2010 and 2011 over royalty payments put the franchisor’s financial position into serious question and further damaged the brand. With the brand’s reputation being an essential part of the customer appeal, this negative publicity was worrying for Maria and Luigi. They were also surprised to learn of the court cases with WES, as the legal proceedings had not been disclosed to them through the disclosure document.  In 2013, about two years into their franchise term, the head office advised that the brand was being sold to a Singaporean company, Global Yellow Pages (GYP). Not long after this announcement, GYP moved into the head office and commenced running operations. Over the next 18 months, Jireh’s head office staff were made redundant, and the infrastructure that had previously supported the brand was destroyed. There was little head office support now available to franchisees, no marketing campaigns were organised, and no innovation occurred. This upheaval resulted in a loss of momentum for Gloria Jean’s. Eventually, the sale to GYP fell through, leaving only a few staff to run the head office operations for the whole of Australia.  Maria and Luigi recall the moment that they found out that a subsequent buyer, Retail Food Group (RFG), had purchased the Gloria Jeans brand. They were excited, because they believed the RFG had many other successful brands operating in their portfolio. They were optimistic about the changes to come.  A couple of months into ownership by RFG, Maria and Luigi began to see the price rises in their cost of goods sold (COGS). During this period, the Ferraro’s also encountered a revolving door of new head office management staff. Each new manager who came in tried to reinvent the wheel and put in place a new plan, bigger and better than the one before. Maria and Luigi acknowledge that in the first year or two, RFG spent an enormous amount of time and internal funds trying to reinvent the brand. A new look and concept would be presented, only to have this whole process repeated when the next General Manager resigned, and their replacement started. This process damaged the brand, and ultimately the value of Maria and Luigi’s cafe. Maria and Luigi found themselves in a position where their bank would not refinance their loan, as the brand was no longer meeting adequate financial requirements because there was no brand advancement or marketing. Maria and Luigi also heard of other franchisees who could not renew their lease, because shopping centres did not want passé brands in their complexes anymore.   Once a new direction for the brand was decided, the plans for the new fit outs and refurbishments were handled by head office. The Ferraro’s recalled that RFG commissioned quotes for the work at their store and then added an additional 20% cost on top of the quote before presenting it to them. Despite raising this as unconscionable activity with the RFG, the Ferraro’s were left with no option but to go ahead with the new fit out, at a significant personal cost. They felt they had nowhere to turn. Soon after paying for their new fit out, Maria and Luigi saw work commence for a Donut King, one of RFG’s other brands, less than 30 metres from their store. Once the Donut King opened, they experienced a weekly loss in sales of approximately $2,500 due to the similarity of their product offerings and their close proximity.  When this was raised with RFG, Maria and Luigi were advised that their franchise agreement and lease did not include any provisions on zone exclusivity. The issue of misappropriation of their marketing fund continued despite the change of ownership. Maria and Luigi became suspicious that their contributions were being used to fund a RFG-brand’s racing cars that the recently retired former CEO had been racing for many years.  Maria and Luigi’s relationship with RFG progressively deteriorated due to the failure of the franchisor to perform essential duties, adequately communicate, provide assistance, honour commitments, and address disagreements. RFG was increasingly adopting what the franchisees considered to be unethical and immoral fee-driven behaviour.  In 2017, nearing the end of their 7-year lease and franchise agreement, the couple had to decide whether they wanted to continue their association with RFG and sign a new set of agreements. As the re-negotiation phase commenced, Maria and Luigi were advised that if they wanted to renew their lease on the store, they would be charged a new franchise fee and would also need to pay to redo the franchisor’s training program at a cost of $20,000, despite having already done it. The couple decided to sell their business.  According to Maria and Luigi, the termination process was unfair and long-winded. The processes and delays caused by the franchisor led to the loss of potential purchasers. At one point, Maria and Luigi received an offer of $180,000 for their store, however the franchisor made the process so difficult, the potential buyer walked away, electing to forfeit the deposit that they had paid. Another potential buyer was directed away from Maria and Luigi’s store to a company owned store in a neighbouring suburb. Many of RFG’s company-owned stores were stores which franchisees had walked away from. During the process of selling their business, RFG offered one of its own stores to Maria and Luigi’s potential purchaser for $15,000.  This practice by RFG devalued their franchisee’s stores and made it impossible for them to sell while a company-owned store was available. Eventually, Maria and Luigi sold their store in 2018 for $60,000 plus stock.  Before allowing the sale of their business to the new franchisee, RFG forced Maria and Luigi to sign a confidentiality agreement. This agreement prevented the Ferraro’s from disclosing any details of their experiences, their relationship with RFG, the business or the products, to slander or seek retribution in any way, or to proceed with any legal action. The couple were restricted from owning another coffee shop after the sale of their franchise for a period of 4 years.   Over the course of owning the franchise, the Ferraro’s re-mortgaged their home and accumulated combined bank loans (home loan, business loans, bank guarantee, personal loan and credit card, franchise fees and arrears on rent, tax and superannuation debt) exceeding $700,000. On many occasions they were forced to inject funds into the business from their personal savings just to keep the business afloat. Neither Maria nor Luigi drew a wage for the first 3 years of operating the franchise, and then drew only a partial salary. The financial stress had a significant impact on their financial health, and on their mental health and marriage.   Reflecting on their experience and naivety in the pre-contractual period, Maria and Luigi acknowledged; “We were led to believe that all Gloria Jean’s stores made a minimum 28% profit. They don’t. Very few do this, if any; it is more like a 3% profit.”  The Ferraro’s often wonder whether they conducted enough due diligence before signing up to become franchisees. They did all they could. They later found out that the stores and franchisees that they had visited during the pre-contractual phase were only the very profitable stores, and not the average store. The franchisees operating the stores they had visited were also involved with the franchisor on a number of levels. They found out the financial statements they were provided with were estimates and not accurate portrayals of earnings.  They wished that they had sought advice during the pre-contract disclosure period from a solicitor and accountant with actual expertise in business format franchising.  In April 2018, the Ferraro’s made a submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry into Franchising. They asked that the PJC:  Consider holding franchisors accountable for the systemic failures in the business model and for providing no support in turning the business into a profitable state. The Ferraro’s asked that the Franchise Code of Conduct be revised to ensure that the franchisor has ‘skin in the game’ to make its directors more responsive and responsible for the success and profitability of their business model.  For a provision to be incorporated that requires franchisors to disclosure the full history of an existing outlet to prospective franchisees. This would reduce the risk of outlets that had failed on multiple occasions from being resold to unsuspecting franchisees.  For ‘example’ financials to be prohibited from inclusion in the disclosure documentation. This ought to be replaced by actuals. 1.2 Reading Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Limited[2010] NSWSC 622 Jireh International Pty Ltd v Western Export Services Inc[2011] NSWCA 137 Mercy Ministries in 20122. Retail Food Group  Retail Food Group (Australia) Limited (RFG) is a publicly listed global food and beverage company, headquartered in Queensland and with offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Los Angeles. Established in 1989, RFG was incorporated in 2003 to act as a holding company for several fast-growing franchise systems. It became Australia’s largest multi-brand retail food franchise owner, with vertically integrated businesses that includes a wholesale coffee roasting operation and a food distribution division. As an amalgamator of franchise brand RFG owns Gloria Jean's Coffees, Brumby's Bakeries, Donut King, Michel's Patisserie, Di Bella Coffee, The Coffee Guy, Café2U, Pizza Capers and Crust. RFG grew from being a small franchise system manager with fewer than 50 franchised outlets to a national and international operation with more than 2,400 outlets in total, of which 1,000 are in Australia. The remaining 1,400 franchised outlets are located in over 80 international licensed territories, that include the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia. RFG and its franchisees employ approximately 15,000 people. In 2014, Gloria Jean’s Coffees was purchased by RFG for $163.5 million from Jireh International Pty Ltd. At the time of purchase, Gloria Jean’s had 519 coffee outlets in Australia and 183 internationally. For RFG, the purchase of Gloria Jean’s Coffees made good business sense, the activities closely mirrored and complemented the existing RFG brands, such as Michel’s Patisserie, Donut King and Esquire’s Coffee Houses. The acquisition also meant:  Through Gloria Jean’s Coffees existing international franchise and licence agreements, RFG gained immediate access to established international markets and supply chain logistics, repositioning itself as a truly global business; A significant increase in the production of coffee, leading to the proliferation of trade for its wholesale coffee roasting business; Strengthening of its supply operations, leading to increased economies of scale, which in theory would benefit the entire RFG franchise community; Diversification of its income streams and a reduction in shareholders’ reliance on any one brand to generate profits; Realisation of RFG’s aspiration to become the largest integrated coffee centric business in the Asia-Pacific, that included wholesale distribution, coffee shops and an “in-home” supermarket product.   2.1 What has happened to the Gloria Jean’s franchisees since RFG took ownership? When RFG purchased Gloria Jean’s Coffees in 2014, existing franchisees were excited by the perceived opportunities that Australia’s largest retail food franchise could offer. Many were interested in becoming multi-unit franchisees and made efforts to further invest their futures in the company. However, it didn’t take long for the franchisees to realise that this would not be the case. Reflecting on the history of RFG, it is evident that the company has a culture of acquiring new brands. As one brand starts to fail, rather than investing to reinvent the floundering brand, it buys another one. For example, in 2006 franchise BB’s Cafe and Esquires Coffee Houses began to wane. In 2007, RFG acquired both Michel’s Patisserie and Brumby’s Bakery. The popularity of Michel’s Patisserie and Brumby’s Bakery began to wane in 2012; RFG acquired Gloria Jean’s Coffees the very next year.  From a franchisee’s perspective, a fundamental flaw in RFG’s operations lies in its growth strategy. Instead of investing in the growth of its individual brands by working with existing franchisees to ensure their success, RFG would instead grow by acquiring more brands. Given the size of its franchise network, RFG’s management believed that they could rely on their long list of well-known brands to ensure that there was always another prospective franchisee ready to buy a failed outlet. This practice, known as ‘churning’, became a financially rewarding short-term arrangement for RFG, but it is not a sustainable long-term strategy.  Between 1 January 2015 and 28 March 2018 franchisees of RFG brands contacted Australia’s competition, consumer protection and franchise regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, (ACCC) at least 61 times about issues relating to their relationship with their franchisor. However, the problems with the business model were made incontestably clear and were placed on the public record during the 2018 Australian Inquiry into the franchising. This inquiry was undertaken by Australia’s Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (the 2018 Committee). The 2018 Committee received 406 submissions. One sixth of the franchisee submissions related to RFG. Through the submissions made by Gloria Jean’s franchisees, serious allegations were made against RFG, in its role as franchisor. According to Gloria Jean’s franchisees, RFG engaged in unconscionable practices including, but not limited to, price gouging through significant fee increases across all aspects of the franchisee’s operations, misappropriation of the compulsory marketing fund levy and the receipt of undisclosed kickbacks from the franchisee’s purchase of goods through approved suppliers. This was in addition to RFG’s failure to provide adequate support or dispute resolution processes.  A further 29 public submissions were made by RFG franchisees in relation to the company’s other brands. In the 2018 Committee’s final report titled ‘The operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct’, it referred to RFG’s poor corporate culture, its \"high risk\" business model that relied on buying new brands, stripping out costs and exploitative gouging of franchisees. The Committee also recommended that the Australian Taxation Office, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and ACCC investigate RFG, former and current board members and senior executives for potential insider trading, tax evasion, quality of audit, director duties and continuous disclosure.  In 2019, there are fewer than 400 Gloria Jean’s franchises still open for business.  2.2 What were RFG’s responsibilities to Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  According to Australia’s Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code), there are certain documents a franchisor must provide prospective franchisee’s before entering into a franchise agreement. These include an information statement, disclosure document and a copy of the franchise agreement in its final form. Under the Code, the parties must also act in good faith towards one another.  Relevant to RFG’s acquisition of Gloria Jan’s Coffees, section 17 of the Code states that a franchisor must inform franchisees of materially relevant changes, such as change of ownership. However, a change in ownership does not afford current franchisees with the right to end their franchise agreement. A franchisee wanting to make a material change needs to obtain the consent of the franchisor, but the franchisor needs no such consent from franchisees. So, when Gloria Jean’s Coffees was purchased by RFG, existing Gloria Jean’s Coffee franchisees were left with no option but to accept the change of ownership, despite the significant implications that this major change would have on their businesses.  In any successful franchise model, there are implicit non-legal obligations that apply to the relationship between the two parties. The franchisor is responsible for nurturing the brand and should always be working to improve all aspects of their system for both franchisees and consumers. A good franchisor also provides initial and ongoing training and support while the franchisees deliver at the coalface. The relationship is symbiotic and always evolving. 2.3 What were RFG’s responsibilities to their public shareholders?  The Friedman Doctrine, or Shareholder Theory holds that a firm's only responsibility is to its shareholders. In Australia, shareholder primacy is paramount. The Corporations Act 2001provides that a director owes a fiduciary duty to the company. Specifically, Section 181(1) requires that directors act ‘in good faith in the best interests of the corporation’. In practice, this means in the interests of the shareholders or members of the company as a whole.  Two Australian Government reviews have been commissioned into whether Australia ought to extend the obligation for directors to act in the best interests of a wider range of stakeholders (for example, shareholders, customers, creditors, the local community), as is the case in France and Germany. The outcome of both reviews was that the law in Australia should remain unchanged and that these broader interests need only be considered in relation to the shareholders’ interests.  2.4 Striking a balance What then is the position of a Gloria Jean’s franchisee within the publicly listed RFG? In its final report, titled ‘Fairness in Franchising’ the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee acknowledged that ‘it is possible that RFG and its officers acted entirely within the bounds of the Franchising Code and other relevant laws. Given the potential exploitation of franchisees through churning and burning within the RFG system, this is a highly troubling proposition because it speaks to the extent to which an outfit such as RFG is able to engage in harmful but legal behaviour’. The report also acknowledged that RFG has damaged the reputation of franchising as a business model more broadly within Australia.  In the case of RFG, the interests of the franchisees were subordinated to the interests of the shareholders. Despite not breaking any of Australia’s corporations’ laws, RFG failed to foresee that corporate goodwill and profitability were inextricably tied to the performance of their franchisee network. While the increase in fees payable by their franchisees may have provide a short-term boost to RFG’s financial bottom line, a franchisor’s, and in this case, a publicly listed franchise owning company’s, long-term profits and sustainability depend for longevity on its franchisees financial success and the strength of the franchisor’s reputation.  The 2018 Committee also recommended that appropriate enforcement action ought to occur where investigations indicate evidence of churning and burning. It further recommended that the ACCC be given powers to intervene to prevent franchisors from marketing and selling franchises during an investigation. As evidenced through the negative publicity and public shaming of RFG, franchisee dissatisfaction became an unstoppable virus that quickly spread through the RFG network. The 2018 Committee acknowledged that the share market has, somewhat belatedly, delivered a damning assessment of RFG's business model. This negative assessment is mirrored by the stringent terms and conditions imposed on RFG by its lenders and the independent auditor's assessment that identifies significant doubt regarding RFG's capacity to continue as a going ‘Fairness in Franchising’14 March 2019,Commonwealth of Australia, p 49.concern.  was trading on the ASX at $7.49 in 2015 and at 14 cents per share in November 2019.  In a general sense, there are benefits to be derived for a franchisee whose brand is purchased by a publicly listed company that were not realised by Gloria Jean’s franchisees. For example, franchisors may be skilled in coming up with a business concept but may not necessarily be equipped, financially or managerially, to continually innovate and move their brand forward as it grows beyond a critical mass. A listed company has access to public funds for development and expansion, may be in a position to acquire competitors and can attract specialist management and directors who are experienced in managing and developing large brands. Of potential benefit to prospective franchisees, public companies are also subject to higher levels of financial disclosure, have reporting requirements and are audited.  2.5 Where to now?  Since the 2018 Franchising Inquiry, RFG is under new executive management. According to the new Executive Chairman, a range of initiatives to better support, connect and benefit RFG’s franchisees have been designed and implemented to improve services to customers. RFG’s Executive Chairman also acknowledged, “The current management team and Board completely understand that RFG’s future success is directly linked to the profitability of its franchisees. We have instituted a comprehensive program of investment and improvement to materially help existing and new franchisees grow and prosper.” It is concerning to note, however, the 2018 RFG Annual Report disclosed that during the 2018 financial year, 9 new international master licenses were granted. These included the Donut King and Crust Brand Systems in the United Kingdom and Gloria Jean’s in Germany.  3. Junior Accountant at RFG  The case study is based on real events documented in submissions made by Retail Food Group employees to the Australian Parliamentary Inquiry into Franchising in 2018. A hypothetical profile of a Retail Food Group employee has been created from the sum of these experiences. Real names of the employees have been changed for privacy purposes.  Sarah Green was a junior accountant, employed by Retail Food Group (RFG) in March 2016 to work at its Sydney head offices. Sarah’s role involved daily maintenance of franchisee files under the direction of a manager; including issuance of invoices to franchisees for payment of the various fees owed to RFG, performance of reconciliations and regular communication with the franchisee who’s accounts she managed.  Within a very short period of time working for RFG, Sarah began to realise that there were serious problems with the RFG business model. Sarah found herself spending most of her working day contacting franchisees regarding outstanding debts to RFG. While understanding that it was normal for people to feel varying degrees of anger, embarrassment and denial regarding outstanding debts, the stories were disconcerting in the regularity of the content. Every franchisee she spoke to seemed to have similar stories of frustration with RFG and increasing levels of stress. Sarah acknowledged in her submission to the 2018 Parliamentary Inquiry in Franchising that ‘There was an overwhelming sense of hopelessness among a lot of the Franchisees I dealt with’.  On a daily basis, Sarah was overcome by stories from exasperated franchisees who said they were lied to in the pre-contractual period about the alleged profit of the store they had purchased and that the profit and loss statements were altered just before their purchase was finalised. Sarah also realised that many of the franchisees had undertaken adequate due diligence during the pre-contractual period, secure in their belief that such a well-known company had credibility.  On one particularly disturbing occasion, a franchisee confessed that her husband was considering committing suicide just so they would receive a life insurance payment. This payment would settle their outstanding debts with RFG. Sarah immediately took this situation to her manager, who assured her that help would be provided to the family. However, when Sarah contacted the family a week later to see how they were going and to ensure someone had contacted them regarding support, the franchisee advised her that someone from RFG had been in contact, but only to tell them that there were outstanding payments and that were due urgently. Again, Sarah took the issue to her manager and she was assured that they would deal with it. Sarah took matters into her own hands and prepared a write-off proposal for the franchisee and presented it to her manager for sign off. It was. Sarah recalls, that in her 9-months working for RFG, she prepared this type of paperwork, without direction from her manager on many occasions.  A lack of support was evidenced throughout the RFG business model. Franchisees did not have access to ongoing business development or marketing support. Sarah acknowledged that everyone in these roles was sacked soon after she started and that the roles were re-established at a lower salary level, with significantly fewer employees. RFG had a huge staff turn-around and a low staff retention rate. It became clear that the senior management believed that there would always be someone to fill the roles. This attitude demonstrated a complete lack of insight regarding the value of staff retention. According to Sarah ‘There were clearly nowhere near enough support staff on the ground to properly and adequately support the franchisees despite this being one of the things franchisees were charged for by RFG.’  Sarah routinely attended presentations made by her manager where announcements were made about new and increased fees that would be charged to franchisees. She knew that there was a team of senior accountants constantly working on new ways to gouge more money from the franchisees. The franchisees were receiving an increasing number of bills for so called ‘improved products and support services’ allegedly being provided to them by RFG. Without any channels for disputing these bills, franchisees had no choice but to pay them or add the debts to their already overdrawn accounts. The common opinion among the franchisee’s Sarah dealt with was that they were slowly, but surely, being bled dry by RFG. Stores were closing regularly.  Sarah also became aware of many instances where RFG was breaching its contractual agreements with franchisees regarding the geographic proximity of their own stores opening in direct competition with each other. There were other instances where RFG permitted its own different brands operating in the same market to open without any concern for inter-brand competition. This was particularly the case with Pizza Capers and Crust Pizza stores. This practice led to many stores becoming unprofitable and ending in closure. When stores would close, RFG was quick to take over, running the outlet as a company-owned store for a period of time and then putting it up for sale to a new franchisee.  Sarah was the only regular point of contact that the franchisees had with RFG. She became the sounding board for their grievances. Sarah put numerous proposals forward to her manager in an effort to improve the issues she saw with the business model and on many occasions acted on behalf of other employees too scared to speak out. All of Sarah’s requests and suggestions were ignored. Sarah felt that the business model could not possibly be sustainable long term. Support staff and franchisees were disgruntled, stressed, and volatile; staff retention rate was low.  As a junior employee with only a few years of experience, Sarah didn’t know who to turn to. She was scared of reporting RFG to the Australian regulators, despite suspecting that the franchisor was acting unconscionably and unethically towards its franchisees. This would have made her a whistle-blower.  The hopelessness of the situation became too much for Sarah. She resigned after 9-months in the role. According to Sarah ‘The level of trauma I witnessed by the franchisees and staff of RFG was unlike anything I have previously been part of. I left because I could no longer function in that environment.’ TEACHING NOTE  SynopsisFranchising is a dominant business strategy for the distribution of goods and services both domestically and internationally. Franchise operations are increasingly found nested within public and proprietary corporate groups. Retail Food Group (RFG) owned 11 franchise brands (at August 2019): Brumby's Bakery, Michel's Patisserie, Donut King, Crust Gourmet Pizza, Pizza Capers, Gloria Jean's, Cafe2U, The Coffee Guy, BB's Café, Big Dad's Pies and Esquires Coffee. It is a global franchise and coffee business supported by a manufacturing and distribution division. Specialising in food and beverage the company is headquartered in Australia and has been listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) since 2006. It was trading at $7.49 per share in 2015, at 10 cents per share in January 2020 and the price of a share had dropped to $0.077 by 24 March 2021. It requested a trading halt in November 2019, seeking funding through a $150m institutional placement. The RFG story exemplifies problems that arise when a franchisor acquires established brands rapidly without having the necessary financial arrangements, management expertise, support infrastructure or organisational strategy in place. Challenges included  needing to keep additional stakeholders (public company shareholders and analysists) happy,  meeting numerous statutory obligations, supporting a rapidly growing network, addressing competition among brands, managing a high turnover of head office staff and management of a series of ownership changes that led to franchisees having a ‘new’ franchisor. The new franchisor implements different, and provides worse, systems and support for franchisees than the original franchisor did.   On 14 March 2019, the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on Corporations and Financial Services handed down its report ‘Fairness in Franchising’ into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct (Code). The PJC commented that \"the problems, including exploitation in certain franchise systems, are systemic\". It said that franchisors have been empowered to take advantage of franchisees under the current regulatory framework, with franchise agreements and the Code offering insufficient protection to franchisees. One sixth of the franchisee submissions made to the inquiry related to RFG. The PJC was particularly critical of RFG calling for three regulators, ACCC, ASIC and the ATO, to investigate its directors. It was also critical of franchisors owned by private equity.  This case study is comprised of three perspectives; a Gloria Jean’s franchisee, Retail Food Group as the franchisor and publicly listed company, and a junior accountant working at Retail Food Group’s head office. Both the perspective of the franchisee and junior accountant are general experience cases, comprised from submissions made by franchisees to the 2018 Parliamentary Inquiry. The RFG perspective is a published information case, comprised of information available through the company’s annual reports, news articles, media release, submissions to the parliamentary inquiry and final report.  2. Learning objectives  Drawing on Naumes work on effective learning objectives, we expect that after reading and analysing this teaching case, students will be able to:   Apply the regulatory framework relevant to business format franchising in Australia, from the perspective of franchisees and franchisors, and the complexities involved with a franchise model that is owned by a public company; Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the business format franchise model; Recognise that a business’s success is dependent on ethical, environmental and sustainable practices and considerations; Naumes, M. J. (2013). Writing effective learning objectives. Case Research Journal(1), 65-171.Analyse legal issues from a commercial perspective in a logical and structured way (ie to identify problems, research relevant sources, conduct due diligence and identify possible challenges to the reliability of franchise system due diligence). 3. Appropriate uses The case examines issues related to the nature and operation of franchising as a business model. In particular: evolution of the franchise business model, particularly in light of increased multi-unit franchisor ownership;  the legal implications of the franchisor/ franchisee contract-based relationship;  legal issues in the context of franchising (eg: intellectual property, retail leases, insolvency);  the regulation of franchising under the Franchising Code of Conduct prescribed under the Competition and Consumer Act (Cth) 2010; and the commercial realities of the franchise relationship.  The case study also highlights how poor attention to governance and human relationships within a complex business network, and how outdated legislation can lead to greater regulatory intervention and can attract prolonged regulator attention.  The case study will enhance student learning by drawing on a current, complex situation that provides lessons in business law and management. Further themes of corporate governance, business ethics, leadership, corporate strategy and sustainability ensure that the case is relevant to a wide range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses within a business school.   4. Case analysis  The three cases can be taught together in one class or individually, depending on the level of detail the course is delving into, and the time available. Students should be allocated 15 minutes to read each individual case study in class, or should read the case beforehand.  INTRODUCTION [5 MINUTES] For the purposes of this teaching note, we will assume that each of the individual cases will be discussed in the one class.  Briefly discuss the franchise business model, the roles of franchisor, franchisee and head office staff. Ensure students are aware of the difference between a franchisor of single brand and a multi-brand franchisor, like Retail Food Group. Briefly discuss the increasing popularity of multi-brand franchise ownership.  PART 1 – FRANCHISEE’S PERSPECTIVE [30 MINUTES]  Break the class up into small groups of 6-8 students. Each group can be assigned two of the below questions to discuss amongst themselves for 10 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of small group reflection on the discussion questions and a 10-minute discussion. What due diligence should/can a franchisee do before they buy a franchised business? Considering the due diligence Maria and Luigi Ferraro undertook, what additional due diligence could they have undertaken in the pre-contractual stage? What additional information, beyond that which is already mandated through the franchise law in your jurisdiction, should prospective franchisees be provided with?  How does the franchise-specific law in your jurisdiction protect prospective franchisees? And, are these pre-contractual protections enough to protect franchisees from franchisor opportunism? What other avenues of redress exist for franchisees in the Ferraro’s position? How did the potential then actual change in ownership at a franchisor level affect Gloria Jean’s franchisee? Is the post-sale restraint of trade the Ferraro’s agreed to legally enforceable? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. PART 2 – FRANCHISOR’S PERSPECTIVE [30 MINUTES]  Break the class up into small groups of 6-8 students. Each group can be assigned two of the below questions to discuss amongst themselves for 10 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of small group reflection on the discussion questions and a 10-minute discussion. A section on recommendations has also been provided. If time permits, allow students to return to their groups for to discuss this. Conclude with a discussion of each group’s answers.  What are the obligations of RFG as new franchisor owner to Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  What are the differences between unethical and unconscionable behaviour?  Has RFG acted unethically towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. Has RFG acted unconscionably towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. Have RFG’s management team acted in accordance with their legal obligations? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. Propose strategies to balance the objectives of shareholders in a franchised company and the needs of franchisees. Recommendations: What are the most important changes that need to be made to RFG’s operations to ensure long-term success of both RFG and the franchisees of the 11 brands it controls? How can these changes be implemented to ensure long-term success? If you were thinking of global expansion where would your next move be to? PART 3 – JUNIOR ACCOUNTANT’S PERSPECTIVE [30 MINUTES]  Break the class up into small groups of 6-8 students. Each group can be assigned two of the below questions to discuss amongst themselves for 10 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of small group reflection on the discussion questions and a 10-minute discussion.  What are the responsibilities of the junior accountant to their employer, RFG?  What are the responsibilities of RFG to the junior accountant?  What are the ethical issues facing the junior accountant?  How does high staff turnover impact on the culture and viability of a franchisor? If you were the junior accountant how would you: identify and assess any risks to yourself? bring any concerns you had to the attention of third parties?  CONCLUDING REMARKS [5 MINUTES] With multi-unit franchise ownership and online purchasing on the rise, the RFG case exemplified many of the complex issues that the franchise business model has and will face. RFG, as a company, has an obligation to its shareholders to maximise dividends. The question raised through this case is how to do so, without destroying the profitability of the franchisees and the franchise business model.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  GLORIA JEAN’S FRANCHISEE 1.1 What due diligence would you recommend a franchisee do before they buy a franchised business? In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) requires franchisors to provide a disclosure document and information statement to prospective franchisees before the commencement of a 14-day waiting period. Franchisees are required to seek expert third-party advice during the 14-day waiting period.  The waiting period is followed by a 7-day cooling off period, post-signature of the franchise agreement.  Other important due diligence activities include:  Hiring a lawyer experienced in the franchise business model go through the franchise agreement and disclosure document.  Hiring an accountant experienced in the franchise business model to go through the financial documents provided by the franchisor, to give advice as needed and perform a credit check on the franchisor. Consultation with existing franchisees in the area. Ask existing franchisees about their relationship with the franchisor, the level of support, training and marketing provided and any of their concerns.   Make the time to observe other franchise businesses in the system operating under typical conditions. This will allow a prospective franchisee to get a gauge of traffic, staff attitudes, employee’s roles and marketing material etc Find out if there are any groups, social media sites or online forums where current or former franchisees talk about the franchisor. Look for customer reviews of existing franchise outlets on Google, Facebook, Zomato and Yelp.  Search court and media records to find any legal disputes involving the franchisor.  Take time to think about the decision.  Understand a franchisee’s legal rights. Be sure to read, and more importantly, understand the Franchising Code of Conduct.  1.2 What additional due diligence could the Ferraros have undertaken in the pre-contractual stage? In addition to speaking with the current franchisees whose details were provided by the franchisor, and consulting a lawyer and accountant during the pre-contractual phase, Maria and Luigi Ferraro should have: Sought out other existing franchisees in and around the area that were interested in opening their store and asked them about their relationship with the franchisor, the level of support, training and marketing provided and any of their concerns. Physically observed other franchise’s operating under typical conditions.  Checked to see if there were any groups, social media sites or online forums where current franchisees talk about the franchisor, Jireh International Pty Ltd. Ensured that the legal and accounting experts they spoke with understood the franchise business model.  Read customer reviews of existing outlets on Google, Facebook, Zomato and Yelp.  Searched court records to find any legal disputes involving the franchisor that were not included in the disclosure document.  Ensured that they understood their legal rights under the Franchising Code of Conduct.  1.3 What additional information, beyond that which is already mandated through the Franchising Code of Conduct, should prospective franchisees be provided with?  In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) includes the following provisions that are designed to protect prospective franchisees: 14-day pre-signature waiting period 7-day cooling off period  Compulsory provision of a disclosure document and information statement followed by 14-day waiting period.  An obligation for both parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith. A requirement to seek expert third-party advice.  Other information that may be useful for prospective franchisees includes:  A list of all current franchisees with their length of ownership and contact details.  A detailed breakdown of marketing levy income and expenditure. A 12-month marketing plan (local and national, if relevant). A detailed list of head office and support staff, duties and information on the number of stores that they look after.  A list of training opportunities made available to existing franchisees in the past 12-months and future 12-months.  The franchisor’s strategic business plans for next 12-36 months. Including new products, prices, growth etc.   1.4 How does franchise-specific law protect prospective franchisees? Are pre-contractual protections sufficient to protect franchisees from franchisor abuse? In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) includes the following provisions that are designed to protect prospective franchisees: 14-day pre-signature waiting period 7-day cooling off period  Compulsory provision of a disclosure document and information statement followed by 14-day waiting period.  An obligation to act in good faith, fair dealing and best and honest practices. A requirement to seek expert third-party advice.  The prevailing regulatory response to protection of franchisees focuses on information provision. Often, the regulator assumes that if the prospective franchisee has been provided with information necessary to inform themselves about the business model, then the prospective franchisee will be suitably equipped to look after their own interests. This is not the case, as the franchise agreement is often one-sided, providing the franchisor with the balance of power throughout the relationship. Further, as identified in final report published by the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on the Franchising Code of Conduct, it is possible for franchisors to engage in harmful but legal behaviour, such as churning and burning.  Instead of further regulatory intervention into the business model, there needs to be a greater focus on improving prospective franchisee’s education and awareness of the harsh realities of franchising and greater transparency into the franchisor’s operations and their experiences and relationships with current and past franchisees.  1.5 What other avenues of redress exist for franchisees in the Ferraro’s position? The Code requires the Ferraro’s to first attempt mediation with their franchisor, RFG. If this fails, the Ferraro’s have the following options:  initiate legal proceedings. initiate a class action, if they know that other franchisees are in the same position.  report breaches to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC has the power to investigate alleged breaches of the Franchising Code and take enforcement action, where appropriate. 1.6 How did the change in ownership at a franchisor level affect Gloria Jean’s franchisee? In many cases, prospective franchisees are drawn to a particular franchise brand by the enthusiasm and vision of the founder. The founder is often passionate and exceptionally knowledgeable about their brand and may even take a hands-on role in the day to day operations. However, when there is a change in ownership, from a founder, or family owned franchisor, to a company or investor-owned franchisor, this can have a significant impact on the culture of the franchise system. Often, the new owner will be concerned with ensuring a return on their investment and will seek to introduce their own ideas on how the system can be improved or perform more profitably. These ideas and changes may be considered good or bad by existing franchisees Whilst most franchise agreements, and specific legislation, restricts the ability of franchisors to unilaterally vary the terms of the franchise agreement, the franchisor is usually able to implement their new changes via the operations manual. This may involve upgrading the look and feel of the brand, new marketing initiatives and product lines which have a significant impact on, and cost to franchisees. In the 18-month period during which Jireh negotiated the sale of Gloria Jean’s to Global Yellow Pages (GYP) the franchisees were without head office support, a marketing strategy, strategic direction or momentum. The sale to GYP did not proceed and instead the brand was sold to Retail Food Group (RFG). Once the actual change of ownership to RFG occurred, there was an increased cost of goods sold to franchisees, increased turnover in support staff, the continual reinvention of the brand and strategy with every new CEO and compulsory fit out costs for updates to the franchisee’s stores.  1.7 Is the post-sale restraint of trade the Ferraro’s agreed to legally enforceable?  The Ferraro’s entered into their original franchise agreement with Jireh International Pty Ltd in 2011. The new Franchising Code of Conduct came into force on 1 January 2015. It altered the enforceability of restraint clauses in franchise agreements entered into, renewed, extended or varied after 1 January 2015. The Ferraro’s franchise agreement was entered into prior to this date, therefore they are subject to the Franchising Code of Conduct 1998.  In the context of franchise agreements, a restraint of trade clause is designed to prevent a franchisee going into direct competition with the franchisor at the conclusion or termination of their franchise agreement. These clauses are typically only enforceable if interpreted to be a reasonable means of protecting the franchisor’s goodwill at the time when the franchise agreement is made. Several factors influence the reasonableness of a restraint of trade clause. The interests and unique circumstances of both parties are considered. In order to be enforced, the restraint must afford no more than adequate protection to the franchisor and must not be injurious to the public. Some jurisdictions have restraint of trade legislation. For example, Restraints of Trade Act 1976Typically, courts recognise that franchisors have an interest in protecting their goodwill, which may be lost or diminished if the franchisee is permitted to compete following the conclusion of their agreement without restriction. In some circumstances, if there are adequate alternative contractual mechanisms within the franchise agreement, other than the restraint of trade clause, that are also designed to protect the interests of the franchisor, their goodwill and confidentiality of information, then the restraint of trade clause may be considered unreasonable. RETAIL FOOD GROUP  2.1 What are the obligations of RFG to Gloria Jean’s franchiseesWhen a change of ownership occurs, RFG, as the new franchisor, took on the rights of Jireh International Pty Ltd and also its obligations. However, the Franchising Code of Conduct (Code) does not outline a clear process to follow when there is a change in franchisor ownership.  Instead, it has been left to the parties to agree on the process that will be adhered to and is in compliance with the existing franchise agreement. The Code imposes an obligation on the existing franchisor to give notice of a change in materially relevant facts to franchisees and any prospective franchisee within a reasonable time (not exceeding 14 days) after becoming aware of that change (see clause 17 of the Code). A change in majority ownership or control is a materially relevant fact and therefore must be communicated to franchisees, as well as a change in the ownership or control of the intellectual property that is material to the franchise system.  2.2 What are the differences between unethical and unconscionable behaviour?  According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) ‘Unconscionable conduct does not have a precise legal definition as it is a concept that has been developed on a case-by-case basis by courts over time. Conduct may be unconscionable if it is particularly harsh or oppressive. To be considered unconscionable, conduct it must be more than simply unfair—it must be against conscience as judged against the norms of society.’ Further, the ACCC advises that ‘Business behaviour may be deemed unconscionable if it is particularly harsh or oppressive and is beyond hard commercial bargaining. There are a number of factors a court will consider when assessing whether conduct in relation to the selling or supplying of goods and services to a customer, or to the supplying or acquiring of goods or services to or from a business, is unconscionable.’ Factors that the courts may take into account when determining unconscionable behaviour include: the relative bargaining strength of the parties whether any conditions were imposed on the weaker party that were not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the stronger party whether the weaker party could understand the documentation used the use of undue influence, pressure or unfair tactics by the stronger party the requirements of applicable industry codes the willingness of the stronger party to negotiate the extent to which the parties acted in good faith. On the other hand, unethical behaviour refers to actions that don't conform to the acceptable standards of business operations.  It is important to understand that what is unethical may not always be illegal (though sometimes it is both). There are many instances where businesses may act within the law, but their actions hurt society and are generally considered to be unethical. This was pointed out by the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee’s final report in reference to the behaviour of the Retail Food Group executive management team. Other examples include exploiting workers and tax loopholes.  2.3 Has RFG acted unethically towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  The 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee’s final report was scathing in its assessment of the “unethical” and “incompetent” practices of RFG executive management. Their final report urged that RFG be investigated by the ACCC and the Australian Taxation Office for several potential breaches. According to the report, RFG seemed to knowingly mistreat franchisees and had “serious problems with the sustainability of the franchise model” and has “… damaged the reputation of franchising more broadly within Australia.” Other examples of unethical behaviour displayed by RFG in the lead up to and during the inquiry included repeatedly refused requests from the Parliamentary Inquiry Committee for documents that could demonstrate whether they knowingly sold failing franchise businesses to unwitting operators, allegations of churning and burning franchisees, overinflating the real costs of fit-outs and refurbishments to franchisee’s stores and misuse of marketing funds.  2.4 Has RFG acted unconscionably towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  While unconscionable conduct has not been proven, the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee’s final report recommended that regulators look into RFG broadly, but also those former executives in relation to possible legal breaches, insider trading, short selling, market disclosure obligations, compliance with directors’ duties, audit quality, valuation of assets, and tax avoidance. 2.5 Have RFG’s management team breached their legal obligations?  The Friedman Doctrine, or Shareholder Theory holds that a firm's only responsibility is to its shareholders. In Australia, shareholder primacy is paramount. Australia’s Corporations Act 2001 provides that a director owes a fiduciary duty to the company. Specifically, Section 181(1) requires that directors act ‘in good faith in the best interests of the corporation’. In practice, this means in the interests of the shareholders or members of the company as a whole. RFG’s management team have acted within the law, despite acting unethically towards their franchisees and without foresight in the context of ensuring that their business model would have long-term success. 2.6 Propose strategies to balance the objectives of shareholders in a franchised company and the needs of franchisees. In Australia, there have been multiple reviews into the statutory duties of directors and whether these should be changed to include a wider social responsibility.  ‘Corporate social responsibility’ and the concept that directors’ duties are owed to other key stakeholders such as franchisees, employees and creditors have been considered by CAMAC, the Australian government’s corporate advisory body. However, their recommendation is that no change be made to the existing legislation. Despite the fact that they do not have a legal obligation to act in the franchisee’s best interests, the executive management team of RFG should consider the interests and needs of franchisees when making all decisions for the brand.  Corporate goodwill and profitability are directly and inextricably related to the performance of a franchisee network and the franchisor’s profit (and therefore the shareholder profit) is directly derived from the turnover and success of the franchisees. Further, a franchisor’s reputation depends on the public perception and popularity of their system which is largely determined by the performance of its franchisees.  Franchisee dissatisfaction quickly becomes an infectious virus that can decimate a network. For sustained franchisor profitability and shareholder returns, the focus has to be directed to franchisee satisfaction and performance.  2.7 RECOMMENDATIONS: What are the most important changes that need to be made to RFG’s operations to ensure long-term success of both RFG and the franchisees of the 11 brands it controls? How can these changes be implemented to ensure long-term success? If you were thinking of global expansion where would your next move be to? RFG must shift its focus from short term return on investments to the success of franchisees and their brands. The needs of franchisees and the markets in which they operate need to be carefully considered and understood, then a plan to support the development and prosperity of the franchisees needs to be designed and implemented. The franchisees should be involved in this.  In its 2018 Annual Report, RFG acknowledged ‘FY18 has been a challenging year for RFG, however the Company is beginning to realise opportunities to better capitalise on the breadth of its operations to support a more sustainable business model for the Group and its franchisees.’ The company has identified a number of initiatives to transform the Group’s franchise business. These include:  rolling out additional revenue drivers for the Group and each Brand System, a relevant example being recent commencement of the rollout of Gloria Jean’s “Good Cup” initiative, which introduces new products, techniques and equipment to revolutionize the brand’s coffee offer and shopper experience, whilst driving additional earnings for franchisees;  a reinvigorated franchise and field support model which builds on the in-field support capability recently added to the network;  a revised distribution model which consolidates 16 current providers to better leverage the Group’s buying power;  a simplified product portfolio that enhances the quality and value of products provided to franchisee customers; and  enhanced digital and analytical capability, so that RFG has a more detailed understanding of the tastes and consumption patterns of consumers who shop with its franchisees.  RFG might want to consider putting any overseas expansion plans on hold until it is in a stronger position in the domestic market.  JUNIOR ACCOUNTANT  3.1 What are the responsibilities of a junior accountant to their employer, RFG?  The main responsibilities of an employee include: do the work that they were hired to do. In this case, Sarah’s role involved daily maintenance of franchisee files under the direction of a manager; including issuance of invoices to franchisees for payment of the various fees owed to RFG, performance of reconciliations and regular communication with the franchisee who’s accounts she managed.  do their work carefully and seriously.  avoiding putting themselves or others in danger.  following their employer's instructions, with the exception of undertaking dangerous or illegal activity. 3.2 What are the responsibilities of RFG to its junior accountant?  In NSW, and all states and territories in Australia, the law requires an employer to provide a high standard of safety and health at the workplace to ensure that employees are not injured or harmed because of their work The employer's 'duty of care' includes protecting the junior accountant from both physical hazards and 'psychosocial' workplace hazards (for example, workplace bullying, illegal activity and aggression). 3.3. What are the ethical issues facing the junior accountant?  Ethically, she has an obligation to:  avoid conflicts of interest; maintain her client's confidentiality; avoid contributing to the perpetration of unlawful acts; ensure her clients are well informed through the provision of comprehensive and accurate advice; ensure her clients understand the advice, and have the capacity to act; be respectful.  As she is a member of CPA Australia, she is subject to the APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants. This Code of Ethics provides guidance on the appropriate response for professional accountants who come across suspected unlawful activity on the part of their client or employer. Where illegal activity is suspected, under the Code of Ethics the accountant is advised to: explain to the client or employer the potential illegality of the arrangement and get them to stop that activity; suggest alternative, legal ways in which the client’s needs might be met; disclose the activity if there is a legal obligation to do so; if the client or employer does not change the suspect behaviour, then resign from the engagement or employment; if disclosure is not mandatory, the accountant should consider whether, in their professional assessment, disclosure is warranted in the public interest. If their professional assessment is that disclosure is in the public interest, they are strongly advised to seek legal advice before proceeding. Sarah must let her supervisor know that an unlawful act may have been committed and advise them of their rights. Sarah should advise her supervisor on potential responses to the situation, satisfy herself that her supervisor understands their rights and the advice, and then seek instructions, confirmed in writing. An ethical dilemma Sarah faces is whether or not to blow the whistle on RFG’s unethical conduct. On the one hand, Sarah’s information could cause RFG to fail or lose much of its stock value and goodwill overnight. That could hurt the already suffering franchisees and/ put her co-workers out of work and into financial jeopardy. Sarah could also face backlash from her manager and threats to her reputation, that have the potential to affect her career. 3.4 How does high staff turnover impact on the culture and viability of a franchisor?High staff turnover impacts the culture and viability of the franchise organisation in number of ways:  Impact on revenue:Employee turnover has a direct impact on company revenue and profitability. For example, the estimated cost of every lost employee is between $5,000 to $40,000, with the amount varying depending on hiring expenses, training costs, lost sales and productivity. If a severance payout is applicable, there is no return on investment. There are also labour costs for human resources staff in placing new recruitment ads, reviewing applications, interviewing and training.  Low employee morale: Low employee morale may stem from overworked employees who have had to take on increased workloads and responsibilities to cover for staff shortages. Deteriorating service quality: Lower productivity and sub-par service quality provided through low overall numbers of service staff or inexperienced staff, to franchisees can cause a disruption to their daily operations.  3.5 If you were the junior accountant how would you: identify and assess any risks to yourself? Here are some common signs that a workplace is not a positive work environment: employee sickness,employee burnout, fatigue, and illness resulting from high levels of stress;narcissistic leadership, managers whodo not take feedback on board or endeavour to ensure that their employees are supported and heard;low levels of enthusiasm among staff;lack of communication or negative communication between managers and their staff;high staff turnover.  To manage the risks to herself, Sarah should:  document everything she does bysaving emails and recording in a diary, dated, comments and decisions from meetings, phone calls, and managers that she interacts with. plan her exit strategy. It is possible that things could improve at the RFG head office, in which case it might make sense to stay. However, in the meantime, Sarah should begin her search for a new job.  3.6 Reporting to third parties?  There are situations that can occur that cause accountants to consider making a report to regulators. Whilst there is not always a legal obligation to bring a concern to the attention of a third party, it should be considered if there is a \"public interest\" in doing so.  Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Act 2019 (Cth)1317AAA defines ‘eligible whistleblowers’ and provides some protection to them: A CPA certified accountant can also look to the CPA Australia Whistleblower Policy that supports the reporting of allegations of serious wrongdoing (“Reportable Conduct”) by CPA Australia, CPA Australia personnel or CPA Australia’s independent auditors. The Whistleblower Policy provides information on an accountant’s rights and obligations throughout any investigation process. The policy seeks to provide clarity on what constitutes Reportable Conduct, as well as the framework CPA Australia has established to manage and support the whistleblowing process.  Examples of serious wrongdoing (“Reportable Conduct”) includes the following:  dishonest, corrupt or illegal activities;  theft, fraud, money laundering or misappropriation;  a serious breach of the Group’s policies and procedures;  offering or accepting a bribe;  use of Group funds or Group resources in a manner that falls within the scope of Reportable Conduct;  damage/sabotage, violence, drug & alcohol sale/use;  risks to the health and safety of workers;  unethical conduct;  bullying, discrimination, harassment or abuse;  victimising someone for reporting Reportable Conduct;  recrimination against someone because they participated in an investigation or review;  any instruction to cover up or attempt to cover up serious wrongdoing. \n",

The research is based on the theories of the New Institutional Economy, the Signals and the Resources and Capabilities. Data were collected from 6,141 survivors and bankrupt franchisor companies the commerce and service sectors reported by Entrepreneur 500 Magazine titled 500 franquicias of year 2006 to 2015, as well as from official reports of the Ministry of Economy (ME), also contemplating the edges of the institutional environment, franchise associations, consultants and government rules including a specific business promotion program for this sector, a multivariate economic model for prediction of failure was constructed based on a longitudinal analysis, using a multiple discriminant model. The main findings made it possible to determine among thirteen variables that the membership to an association, the accreditation of a consultant, the age of the company before franchising, the number of units before franchising, the percentage of royalties and the size of the network better discriminated between the two study groups. This work adds three stages and seven new variables to the model of franchise success proposed by Nijmeijer, Fabbricotti and Huijsman (2014), which have scarcely been empirically or jointly studied in national or international research. Key words: The New Institutional Economy theory, the Signals theory, the Resources and Capabilities theory, failure, franchise models, México. Introduction Mexico is considered one of the most developed markets in Latin America (Fadairo and Lachimba, 2017) thanks to stability and steady growth (AMF, cited by D.C., USA, 2018).  During the period 2006 – 2016 Mexican franchisor companies and outlets experienced a growth rate of more than 200% (Cortes, 2019). This contributed between 6% and 10 % to the GDP (Guerrero, Armenteros and Medina, 2014, D.C., USA., 2016). However, the failure rate was of more than 10% in Mexican franchises in the commerce and services sectors during the period 2006-2014. This situation affected more than 10,326 outlets, but there aren’t any studies that have determined the causes of the failure of Mexican franchisors, representing a gap in the information about the factors that caused such failure. Most of the impact falls on the franchisees, since many took out loans in order to obtain the franchises. Some invested in companies that were not ready to franchise (Jalife, 2016). Franchisor failure also affects the suppliers, creditors, employees, among others. This situation also enveloped franchise consultants, who were part of the Mexican Franchise Association (MFA).  Representatives of the public and private sectors, consultants and the MFA together developed the basis for the National Program of Franchises (NPF) (SE, 2012; Feher, 2015). The program was considered ineffective in achieving the its objectives (only 40% in the new Mexican franchisors the franchisees units and jobs generated were under 1%) in spite of having offered financial loans with a 0% interest rate during a six-year period (Cortes, 2019). In addition, the MFA was ranked last out of 46 countries as far as ethical content is concerned (Gámez, Díez de Castro, Navarro and Rondán, 2008), and has room for improvement in its administrative Management. Franchisor membership rates were under 30%. Furthermore, the MFA had internal disagreements which paved the way for the appearance of new franchise associations, fragmenting the information of the sector (Cortés, 2019). There also exist glaring conflicts of interests among franchise representatives (Abell, 2013). Further, failed franchisee data have been hidden or minimized by the franchisors themselves (Díez and Rondán, 2004), or have been manipulated to exclude inefficient enterprises that have changed owners multiple times (Jalife, 2013). Even though Mexico has laws for the franchise sector. The legislation, regulation and guidelines is weak, such as insufficient contract registration at the National Institute of Industrial Property (NIIP)   (only 21% in a ten-year period) (Cortes, 2019). Varying degrees of MFA obstruction of regulations have been detected in the chamber of deputies and senators: a lack of measures obliging franchisors to declare bankruptcy or lawsuit by franchisees; lack of validation in the content of franchise disclosure documents (Dodge, 2014), and difficulty during conciliation processes due to various improvements needed in contracts, manuals and franchisor supervision (Cortes, 2019). As a result, new companies appear which, after calling themselves franchises, develop new ways to commit fraud (Senado de la República, 2017). This makes it easy to gain access to inexperienced companies (Jalife, 2013). Besides, In México the small and medium-sized enterprises were characterized by low productivity (OECD, 2013), with inefficiencies in: a) management capabilities, b) training, c) use of performance indicators and human resources, and d) technological lag, among others (Enaproce, 2015). Mexico’s commerce and services sector registered the highest company birth and death rates (INEGI, 2018), and were also last place in productivity levels (OECD, 2017a) compared to 26 other OECD countries. Franchise model failure has received little attention in Mexico (Young and McIntyre, 2011, Buchan and Frazer, 2013). In the international context, literature related to the failure of franchisor companies has been focused on several internal factors, with insufficient integration of contextual factors such as institutional pressures (Combs Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2009), the economy, society (Perrigot, Cliquet and Mesbah, 2004), governmental impact (Beere, 2017), financial support from the Federal Government (Ayup and Cavazos, 2015) or external certifications (Bordonaba et al., 2009). In spite of the fact that these factors can affect franchisor results (Frazer, Merrilees and Wright, 2007; Grewal, Iyer, Rajshekhar and Radulovich, 2011), the meager empirical research conducted to date has not yet shown clarity when integrating them. All of the above leads us to doubt the feasibility of these factors being put together in a success model for franchises (Nijmeijer et  In Spanish, Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrialal., 2014). Hence, it is necessary to combine several theories and disciplines to address the challenge (Barthelemy, 2011; Samsudim et al., 2018; Gillis and Castrogiovanni, 2012; Dant, 2008; Combs, Ketchen, Shook and Short, 2011). The aim of this study is to determine the internal and external factors influencing the failure of the Mexican franchisors. In the external factors we use levels 1, 2 and 3 of the theory of the New Institutional Economy (NIE) (Williamson, 2000) with a group of nine hypotheses that refer to the customs and traditions of informal institutions (affiliation to an association, accreditation of a franchise consultant), the institutional environment (laws in Mexico and regulation of the Disclosure Document), the governance structure (franchisor accredited by a government program, age and units before franchising). Also, we use level four of the NEI (NIEt) and the Signalss theories (St) (Gallini y Lutz, 1992) in two hypotheses about the data that Mexican franchisors use to market their franchise model (franchise fee and royalty rate).  Finally, we employed of the Resources and Capabilities (RCt) (Barney, 1991) and level 4 of the NIE (Williamson, 2000) theories in four hypotheses. Its involve the management of the franchise network (growth, network size, professionalized staff , training of the franchisor's staff and managerial capabilities of the Mexican franchisor). Our research baseline is to propose a multivariate econometric model of failure prediction, providing variables for the conceptual franchise success and failure model proposed by the Nijmeijer et al. (2014) to identify, analyze and correlate the factors causing the downfall of Mexican franchisors. In light of the above, a quantitative explanatory, longitudinal study was performed, encompassing 6,141 failed and survivors’ Mexican franchisors in the commerce and services sector from 2006 to 2014. Section two provides the analytical framework, the conceptual background and hypotheses, the hypothetical analysis model, and the variables used. Section three describes the methodology, treatment of data and statistic design. Section four presents results, conclusions, the proposal for a conceptual model of the success and failure of franchisors in Mexico, and finally, an examination of future implications. Section II. Analytic framework Franchisor’s failure has been minimized by the defenders of the sector, resulting in scarce academic (Macías, 2015), scientific (Morris, 2006), professional and governmental attention (Buchan, 2013). Buchan et al. (2015) affirm that franchisor failure is continuous, international; making it necessary to conduct research in different markets in The United States (Dant, Perrigot and Cliquet, 2008). In this sense, Buchan et al. (2015) agreed to identified a need for do more empirical work concerning franchisor failure using multidisciplinary, inter-jurisdictional, intercultural and longitudinal focuses on the entire sector.  This led to the need for a more profound and complete understanding of the complexities and nuances of such, as well as why other franchisors do prosper (Combs, Ketchen, Shook and Short, 2011). Also, Barthelemy (2011) and Varotto and Aureliano-Silva (2017) detected insufficient studies on the institutional perspective (sector regulation), Pfister, Deffains, Doriat-Duban and Saussier (2006) discovered in their earlier study how institutions do affect the growth rate of franchises in nine countries. Facanha et al. (2013) suggested exploration of the New Institutional Economy Theory (NIET) (Williamson, 2000) in failure studies, since it analyzes the importance of institutions in the economic changes of people and companies resulting from economic policies present in four levels. Moreover, Fernández and Gutiérrez (2011) agreed upon the absence of an academically accepted theory explaining the empirical study of business failure due to the objectives, research design, an elevated dispersion by the diversity of variables selected to integrate a model (De Andrés, 2000). Several works also confirmed the absence of a perfect model of failure prevention, since most of them possess both positive and negative aspects (Macías, 2015). Buchan (2013) declared that there is a great range of causes of franchisor failure Macías (2015) grouped them by analysis levels: 1) the businessperson’s profile and that of his/her company, 2) the selected strategy for the new company, and 3) the influence of the environment on the new company. Meanwhile, Rodriguez-Rad and Navarro-García (2007) classified the causes according to a) moral risk, b) activity risk, c) political and economic risk, and d) risk of failure. Nevertheless, our research will be based in the stages that spur franchisor failure have been classified 1) pre-franchising, 2) franchisor model development and marketing 4) franchisor network development as proposed by Cortes (2019). Conceptual background and hypotheses Membership by the Mexican Association of Franchises The NIE theory in level 1, states the truth about how a sector must be conducted by the institutions (Willianson, 2000), generating connections and measures with complementary institutions in order to protect themselves and to influence the decisions made by entrepeneurs (Barthelemy, 2011., Doherty et al. 2014). Therefore, institutional isomorphism has become a established and spreaded between organizations (Zucker, 1988). Combs et al. (2009) agreed that associations and consultants produce mimetic pressure on the Mipymes (Combs et al., 2009). Furthermore, Shane and Spell (1998) sustained that the belinging to an association of franchises provides a quality guarantee, and reduces the probability of failure for the franchisor. Hence, : The membership of The Mexican Association of Franchises is positively related to the Mexican franchisor’s success. Lincense of a certified consultant by the National Program of Franchises The institucionalization of the franchising sector is greater when third parties interfere, such as commercial editors and consultant companies (Lounsbury quoted by Combs et al., 2009). The franchising consultants support is the clue to improve the franchisors performance (Samsudin et al.2018) in order to have a sustainable industry through professional solid and vital assistance during the first stages of the franchisor. The NPF favored the increasement (350%) of franchises consultants (Cortes, 2019). Only 11 consultants could license more than 4 million Micro, Small and Medium business (MSMEs) during the period of 2006 to 2012. The license by the franchisor allowed the Access to loans for their franchisees. Therefore, : Having a license provided by a PNF certified consultant is positively related to the Mexican franchisor business success. Regulation in the Mexican franchising sector The NIE theory in level 2, involves the definition and execution of the formal norms (rules, regulation, executive, legislative, juridical and bureaucratic functions,of the government) needed for the economic productivity of a country (Willianson, 2000). The misapplied laws ease the deceivement to the franchised (Purvin, 2008), just as the wrong management of a conflict (Wang, Grünhagen, Ji, & Zheng, 2020). An excess of the sector regulation is not desireable for the franchisors (Hoffman et al., 2016), due to the positive impacto f a low regulation and propitious over them (Samsudin et al., 2018). Thus, : The regulation of the Franchising sector in Mexico (LPI) is positively related to the Mexican franchisors net expansion and success.  Disclosure Document regulation (DD regulation) The franchisee makes uncertain decisions about the frachisor’s solvency (Buchan and Frazer, 2011), since the previous information in the DD does not anticipate, nor does it address the consequencies of the franchisor’s administration (Buchan, 2013). Quality is more important than quantity when providing information during the initial stage and before the contract of the franchise (Atwell, 2015). Therefore, : The regulation of the Disclosure Document is positively related to the franchisor’s net expansion and business success. Franchisor licensed by the National Progran of Franchises (NPF) The NIE theory in level 3, contemplates the rules of the governing game through the government institutions, in order to mitigate conflicts and obtain mutual profits (Willianson, 2000). The sociopolitical legitimity acknowledges the enterprises (Aldrich y Fiol citado por Rodríguez-Rad y Navarro-García, 2007) and eases the access to resources (Aldrich y Auster, 1986) from outer media that favor the franchisor’s survival (Shane y Foo, 1999) through business growth programs. Hence, : Being part of the licensed franchisors by the NPF, has a positive relation with net expansion and business success. Age and number of sales items of the franchisor before franchising The NPF asked the candidate enterprises for two requirements before franchising: a) having at least 2 years of antiquity before franchising and b) operating with two or more own units with excellent results (SE, 2012). Since the experience “is a sustainability and validation test of the business concept” \"(Jeremías 2016, p. 46), turning the model of business into a proved and solved concept (Buchan et al., 2015), steady and lasting (Weaven et al., 2018; Buchan y Frazer, 2013), besides the belonging to a known trademark. : A minor age before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net expansion and business success. : A low number of units before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net expansión and business success. Franchise fee and franchisor´s royalties during the commercialization stage. The NIE theory in level 4 depicts how the first three levels in enterprises influence, since these have a productive fuction with a purpose and economic effect (Willianson, 2000). On the other hand, the benefits or the success of a business model are sent through messages (Signals theory) to the potential franchisee people, through the opening of own units, and a high royalty rate or franchise fee (Gallini y Lutz, 1992). However, the franchisors offer initial fees and costs in order to get a greater growth (Shane, Shankar y Aravindakshan, 2006) The policy of free prices should allow the incipient franchisors to accelerate the recruitment of the franchisees (Tsang y Finnegan, 2013). Ergo, we proceed: : A low franchise fee in chain stores with a minor age before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net expansion during the model commercialization and business success. A low royalty rate in enterprises with a minor age before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net growth during the commercialization of the franchise model and business success. Franchise net growth The RC theory (Barney, 1991) explains the competitive advantage and growth by assuming that enterprises are heterogeneous, given that they possess unique resources and capacities. In this way, the expansion of the franchise net facilitates the franchisor’s survival (Shane y Foo, 1999). There exists a close relation between growth and size or the net (Polo-Redondo, Bordonaba-Juste y Palacios, 2011); however, the quick expansion in younger franchise chains with higher rates of franchised units has high mortality rates as well (Dobbs, et al, 2012) because they grow under the limit of efficiency (Martin, 1988) due to an inadequate growth or the lack of a constant growth rate. Therefore, : A greater growth of the net related to the low franchise fee, the low royalty rate, the low number of units and the low age before franchising, has a positive relation with the franchisor’s business success. :  A greater size of the net related to the low franchise fee, the low royalty rate, the low number of units and the low age before franchising, has a positive relation with the franchisor’s business success. Franchisor’s professional and competent staff The franchisor’s Manpower is important (Meng-Yh, Jer-Yan, Tzy-Yih y Tomas, 2010), because they provide support and technical assistance to the franchisees. Besides, they design and administrate the supply chain of the net (Navarro y Puig, 2017), and take active intangible part (Perdreau, Nadant y Cliquet, 2015), due to the adjustment between them (the franchisoer’s staff) and the way they deal and lend the service (to the franchisee), is what determines the survival of the franchisor (Weaven et al., 2018). Therefore, : The franchisor’s professionalized and competent staff has a positive relation with the management of a big-sized net and business success. Franchisor’s staff training The correct manner in which Manpower is used is the one that creates competitive advantages (Gillis y Combs, 2009), since a correct execution (Hoffman y Preble, 2003) is linked to success and net growth (Unger et al, 2011), influencing potential decisions taken by new franchisors and generated by the investment in resources and capabilities on the franchisor’s part (Gillis, 2007), therefore we predict, : The training of franchisor personnel is positively related to the management of a big network and the success of the Mexican franchisor Manager capabilities of the franchisor entrepreneur The franchisor is an entrepeneur who built the business model. This person has the experience of having started a business (Jeremiah, 2016) by showing sustainability and validation of its concept (Macías, 2015). Therefore, he/she is someone one can learn from (Grünhagen , González-Díaz , Hussain & Monteiro da Silva Filho, 2020): is assumed that he has abilities, as a manager too (WEF, 2014); as the efficient use of performance indicators and the ability of solution by implementing improvement actions (Enaproce, 2015), to provide sustainability to the net and to the business itself (Frazer et al., 2014; Croonen and Broekhuizen, 2017). Therefore, The manager capabilities of the entrepreneur has a positive relation with the management of a big-sized net (total units) and franchisor’s success. Internal and external factors in the determination of the franchisor’s failure Several studies have suggested to broaden investigations about the importance of the context in determining the failure of the franchisor; such as: a) institutional pressures institucionales (Combs et al., 2009), b) the society (Samsudin et al., 2018), c) the legal situation of a country (Perrigot et al., 2004), d) the government impact (Beere, 2017), and e) the financial supports from the government and the external certifications (Bordonaba et al., 2009). The latter allows to infere that literatura has not clearly demonstrated to include context factors inside a model of success factors in the franchises. (Nijmeijer et al., 2014). Thus, There is a preponderant difference between the context factors and the own factors of the Enterprise, determining the failure of the Mexican franchisor during the period of 2005-2014. Hypothetical model and hypotheses In this paper, we propose the following correlation of theories for the analysis of The Mexican franchisor failure suggested by Hoffman, Munemo and Watson (2016) (see figure (see Figure 1).

This lack of legal harmonization amongst the different jurisdictions is exacerbated by the absence of an international regime governing mandatory disclosure of information to would-be franchisees before the franchise agreement is concluded, meaning that enterprising franchisors may seek out jurisdictions with little to no protective regulation, engaging in sharp practices, whilst prospective franchisees have no means of securing key information and legal redress.  This paper asks whether the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has a role to play in filling this regulatory void, by developing a regime obliging franchisors to provide key information to prospective franchisees in the period leading-up to the conclusion of a franchise agreement? This paper looks at the current system in light of literature on mandatory disclosure in the field of regulation, to show that this system is inadequate. In light of these gaps, this paper advocates the position that the UNCITRAL should work alongside UN member states to design and develop a mandatory disclosure regime. After looking at the current regulatory framework (part 1), exploring the concerns associated with absence of an international mandatory disclosure regime (part 2) and considering the value of introducing an international regime of mandatory disclosure (part 3), I ask whether this is the type of project the UNCITRAL should consider (part 4). In the concluding segment of this paper, I explore the framework the UNCITRAL should consider introducing to protect prospective franchisees and optimise their investment decision-making process. Key Words/Phrases:Regulation, regulatory justifications, private international law, global franchising, franchisee protection, UN law, UNCITRAL Introduction Notwithstanding its longstanding usage as a domestic business model, franchising started to be used as a cross-border business strategy primarily in the 1930s growing in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.  Between 1975 and 1985, the number of US firms with overseas outlets doubled from 175 (in 1972) to 342 (in 1985) and the number of overseas outlets grew from 6153 (in 1972) to 30188 (in 1985). Most of the domestic growth in the US happened between 1960-4 (halving in the period 1965-9) with international growth picking up the relay in 1970-5  Some suggest that the concept of a franchise as a commercial arrangement can be traced back to the Norenkai system in the 1600s in Japan, whilst others suggest the tied house system used in Germany and the United Kingdom, in the 1700s. (Hackett 1976)  Hackett 1976: 66-7; Mendelsohn 2004: 16. Domestic growth data on a country-by-country basis is provided by UNIDROIT. (UNDROIT Guide 2007: 256-262) Nowadays, franchising contributes significantly to the GDP of many nations - United Kingdom (£15.1 billion), Germany (€48 billion) and France (€47.6 billion) (Abell 2013: 1, citing French Franchise Federation Report 2010) According to recent data, there are now in excess of 12,000 franchised brands in Europe with over 500,000 franchised units which employ roughly 3 million employees.(Boulay 2020: 49 citing European Franchise Federation, 2019)  Kostecka 1987; Brickley, Dark and Weisbach 1991: 27. - a decade on from the period of domestic boom. Fast food is the leading sector in terms of domestic and international growth; accounting for highest number of new units opened over the period 1970-5 (22.4% domestically and internationally), with both the soft drinks and business services sectors exhibiting substantially growth over the same period (accounting for 12.9% and 10.6% of the international and domestic growth respectively).The reasons why franchisors seek to expand using franchising are diverse. Diversification, customer-retention, access to new markets, financing and new know-how are amongst the leading factors in this move to expand internationally. Such expansion affords established franchisors an opportunity to reduce their reliance on domestic markets, to diversify their revenue streams and to help guarantee new revenue streams during periods of economic downturn. According to recent data, the vast majority of US franchisors (63 percent) seek out international franchisees due to domestic market saturation and the attractiveness of untapped markets. International franchising exists in over sixteen industries, but the main industries in which franchisors are seeking international franchisees are the food retail, hotels and motels, and recreation. With the help of enterprising and invested national entrepreneurs familiar with the target market, franchisors are able to gain a established foothold in new untapped markets. This strategy yields financial benefits (royalties, ongoing payments for stock and services, lump sums) providing access to human capital, manpower, know-how, investment and funding opportunities, and helping build up brand recognition and market share. Whilst also, ensuring existing clientele have access to their outlets whilst they are travelling, guaranteeing them a consistent experience and familiar level of comfort rather than running the risk of losing them to competitors.Part one – Current regulatory framework (structure and justifications)  Hackett 1976: 66; Brickley, Dark and Weisbach 1991: 27.

The regulation of franchising is a fairly recent phenomenon with California State reported to be the first jurisdiction to introduce regulation governing franchises.  Currently, regulation is purely domestic in origin, though there is growing recognition of the importance of regulating cross-border franchise activity. Over the past 50 years, three regulatory regimes have emerged governing the offer and roll-out of franchises: Disclosure, registration and relationship. In jurisdictions with registration regulation typically franchisors are obliged to register and file documents before advertising for franchisees, with a public body entrusted with the power to oversee registration. Regimes with relationship statute guarantee franchisees certain key protections, protecting them against certain contingencies that may arise during the term of the franchise relationship and at the end of the relationship. In this paper, I focus on mandatory disclosure and look at the merits of this regulatory regime and how it can be used to enhance cross-border franchise activity. Some jurisdictions use mandatory disclosure regulation alone. Others – such as Californiause such regulation alongside other regulatory regimes; most commonly registration regimes which require franchisors to register before offering franchises for sale. Typically coupled with a pre-contractual ‘cooling off’ period, mandatory disclosure regulation is used in jurisdictions worldwide, including the United States (at the federal level – FTC Rule and in a number of states), France, Italy, and Canada (in a number of provinces including Alberta, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and more recently British Columbia). Generally, in these jurisdictions, disclosure takes place within a defined period before the date on which the prospective franchisee is due to sign the franchise agreement or to pay money towards the franchise providing the prospective franchisees with the time to withdraw from negotiations. These periods vary in length ranging from fourteen to thirty days. In 1971, California State introduced a disclosure and registration statute. Shortly after California, federal legislation introduced a disclosure statute. The legislation in California influenced other states in the US to introduce similar legislation and inspired Ontario, to introduce disclosure statute.  Non-legislative instruments have been developed by UNIDROIT and a number of franchise associations.   A pioneer in the field of franchise regulation, the legislature in California introduced the California Franchise Investment Law (CFIL),a registration and disclosure statute [C § 31000 (West 1977)]. Inspired by US securities legislation, in the State of California, legislatures have introduced legislation which provides for disclosure and registration, obliging franchisor to register their documentation governing the sale and operation of a franchise with a governing body with oversight powers. In addition, the California Franchise Relations Act (CFRA) governs the relationship between the franchisee and franchisor throughout the contract lifecycle [C § 20000 (West1981)].  Doubin law no 89-1008 of 31 December 1989 now Article L330-3 of the Commercial Code.  Italian Franchising Law (n.129/2004) Each province in Canada has jurisdiction to regulate franchising. Six provinces have adopted franchise legislation (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island). See also, RONALD ARDNERRANCHISINGEALITIES AND EMEDIES 84 (Law Journal Press ed. 2003) [hereinafter GARDNER Fourteen days in Ontario (A5(1), Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, SO 2000, c 3) and Alberta (A4(2), Franchises Act, RSA 2000, c F-23). Twenty days in France (Article L330-3). Thirty days in Italy (Article 4, Italian Franchising Law n.129/2004) Mandatory disclosure regimes typically oblige franchisors to provide would-be franchisees with a written pre-contractual disclosure covering a number of stipulated items. This bird’s-eye view of the franchise covers three fields of information: The franchisor (its obligations and business credentials), the franchisee (its obligations and financial commitments) and the franchise. Such disclosure covers strategic information regarding the franchisor, including current and past litigation and bankruptcies, addressing the franchisee’s financial commitments (initially and on an ongoing basis) and obligations, alongside the franchisor’s obligations. Other items covered include financing, intellectual propertyand other items pertinent to a potential franchisee’s decision to purchase. A failure to provide such a disclosure, will typically be deemed an unfair or deceptive act or practice.Such a disclosure is typically made using a template Disclosure Document accompanied by the draft franchise agreement and any other relevant contractual documentation. Similar regimes are used in United States since the 1970s in California State and at the federal level. The first State in the United States to introduce disclosure and registration regulation, California has inspired many other jurisdictions in their regulatory journey. Pursuant to rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission in 1979 (amended in 2007), a franchisor must furnish would-be franchisees with a FDD (franchise disclosure document), at least 14 calendar days before a  The obligations and business credentials of the franchisor (items 1-4, 19-21), the obligations and financial commitments of the franchisee and the franchise itself (items 5-18), including details about the competitive nature of the market where the franchisee will be operating.  16 C.F.R. § 436.5(a) (2018). For a discussion on the items, see Uri Benoliel, Are Disclosures Really Standardized?, 62 VILL. L. REV. 1 (2017).    In the US, this is capable of amounting to a violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act - 16 C.F.R. § 436.2 (2007).  In France, for example, Loi Doubin, proposed by Minister Doubin in 1989, requires frank disclosure at least 20 days before the date assigned for signing the contract - Such disclosure must be made in a Disclosure Document accompanied by the draft agreement. (Emerson 2021) The disclosure statutes in Alberta and Ontario oblige franchisors to disclose set information and key documents to would-be franchisees 14 days before the signing of the agreement or the payment of consideration (whichever is the earlier). Failure to do so will result in a right to rescind. Misrepresentation will permit a claim for damages. Though Quebec has no dedicated franchise regulation, the Civil Code of Quebec obliges franchisors to bring external contractual clauses contained in documents outside the franchise agreement (such as the operational manual) to the attention of the would-be franchisee during the bargaining phase. (9150-0595 Québec inc. v. Franchises Cora inc., 2013 QCCA 531)  The legislature in California introduced two bodies of regulation protecting the interests of potential and actual franchisees: A registration and disclosure statute, The California Franchise Investment Law (CFIL) - C § 31000 (West 1977) – and relationship statute, the California Franchise Relations Act (CFRA) - C § 20000 (West1981). Several years after the introduction of the CFIL, a disclosure statute was introduced at the federal level, promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and commonly referred to as the FTC Rule - 16 C.F.R. § 436.1 (2007) – this regulation applies in each one of the fifty states, the District of Columbia and all US territories in line with the Supremacy Clause in the US Constitution (Babette Marzheuser-Wood & Brian Baggott, Franchise Law in the US, Dentons p2 (2015). U.S.ONST. art. VI, cl. 2.) binding agreement is signed, addressing 23 key fields of information (known as ‘disclosure items’). The information that must be included in the FDD is comprehensive in nature and is intended to give the prospective franchisee a panoramic view of the franchise, thus ensuring that the would-be franchisee has an all-encompassing prospective of the franchise and its infrastructure.  Part two – Concerns associated with the current international mandatory disclosure regime  Due to the lack of harmonisation amongst the different jurisdictions, where regulation does exist the levels of protection afforded to prospective franchisees differ from one jurisdiction to another. Even varying from one province to another within the same country. In those jurisdictions with no legal framework such as the United Kingdom, would-be franchisees have no dedicated system of rights and remedies tailored to the franchise relationship, leaving aggrieved parties to look to general law for solutions, and franchisors have no obligation to furnish would-be franchisees with information and documentation regarding the franchise. In such situations, the parties will often have no specific rights and obligations during the period leading-up to the signing of the franchise agreement and throughout the relationship. As such, an aggrieved prospective franchisee who suffers a loss during the pre-contractual phase will need to look to general law for protection and redress. Depending on the act or omission that has caused the loss and the laws of the jurisdiction involved, she may be able to look to for example to contract law (misrepresentations), criminal law (fraud), tort and if available, the laws obliging the parties to exercise good faith. What is more, in cases involving cross-border negotiations of franchises, where the franchisee and franchisor are based in different  FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, FRANCHISE RULE 16 C.F.R. PART 436 COMPLIANCE GUIDE (May 2008), https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/bus70-franchise-rule-compliance-guide.pdf.  Unless a transaction is exempted under the FTC Rule, where there is an offer or sale of a franchise situated in the United States or its territories, the prospective franchisee must be furnished with an FDD 'at least 14 calendar-days before the prospective franchisee signs a binding agreement with, or makes any payment to, the franchisor or an affiliate in connection with the proposed franchise sale.’  § 436.2(a).  This 14 (calendar) day period starts on the day after the delivery of the FDD; in other words, the signing of the agreement or the receipt of payment can only take place on or after the 15th calendar day following delivery. (FRADE OMPLIANCE UIDE20).  Item 23 is merely procedural and is a requirement that franchisors obtain a signed receipt from each prospective franchisee confirming receipt of the FDD and accompanying exhibits.  In Canada, Ontario, Alberta and Prince Edward Island are amongst the only provinces to have introduced law governing the rights of franchisees to disclosure of information.   The contractual relationship between the parties in jurisdictions without dedicated laws governing franchises will be governed by private law (the terms of the franchise agreement and any associated agreements) and general law (common law if applicable, code, and/or statute). Such agreements are typically drafted by the franchisor and offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis to prospective franchisees.  jurisdictions, it is not always clear which body of law governs the negotiation process and the contract itself (in the absence of a choice by the parties themselves), as such the rights of the prospective franchisee during the negotiation phase will be unclear which may open her up to potential abuse.The absence of a harmonised system of international regulation coupled with the variations in domestic regulation and the lack of international regulatory bodies in this field result in a number of problems. Firstly, A high degree of legal divergence creates technical barriers with a potential of discouraging expansion into new markets impeding cross-border commerce and synergies, limiting consumer choice, undermining effective competition and hindering domestic growth and job creation.313233 The technical barriers created by these divergences in regulation have the potential of discouraging franchisees and franchisors from expanding their respective operations across borders, adversely affecting cross-border activity, impeding integration of markets, and limiting consumer choice.Secondly, the present system of self-regulation used in many jurisdictions lacks clarity and consistent enforcement, and is heavily weighted in favour of franchisors, which coupled with the lack of uniformity amongst the national franchise laws, has a dampening effect on the efforts of franchisors looking to roll out across different markets creating barriers to cross-border activity and synergies. Thirdly, the lack of uniformity acts as a potential impediment to cross-border synergies, impeding the flow of commerce and trade from one jurisdiction to another. Franchises often involve not only a provision of service and the licensing of IP but also the sale of goods by the franchisor or their approved suppliers to the franchisees. Fourthly, this situation  National law is applied to an international franchise agreement by virtue of the parties’ election or by virtue of the law applicable in the absence of such an agreement between the parties on governing law. (Stetsiuk et al 2018: 334)  Wai 2002: 251.  These are enumerated in a study prepared in 2016 for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, and in the Resolution of the European Parliament released in 2017. In a union of twenty-seven Member States (post withdrawal by the UK), only six Member States have mandatory disclosure regulation intended to reduce the risks that franchisees are exposed to, by guaranteeing that key information relating to the franchise operation is disclosed to the prospective franchisee prior to the signing of the franchise contract. (IMCO 2016: 14. Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, supra note 11 at 14)  As of 2016, the EU is under-performing with franchising only being 1.89% of GDP in the EU, but it is 5.95% in the United States (EP Motion for a European Parliament Resolution on the functioning of franchising in the retail sector 2016/2244 (INI): para. C). supra note 7 at para E.  Other key inhibitors are the differences in the national treatment of unfair trading practices by the various Member States. Para 2) with much of the franchise legislation introduced on a national level protects the interests of prospective franchisees by focusing on the pre-contractual disclosure by the franchisor, without the enactment of enforcement provisions ensuring the continuation of the franchise relationship, . Para 5) , E) , para. E.  at 6, 21. leaves room for potential abuse and opportunistic behaviour by enterprising franchisors. These gaps encourage opportunistic franchisors to engage in regulatory arbitrage in a bid to monopolise jurisdictions that offer relatively little to no regulation. Enterprising franchisors may be tempted to engage in a type of forum shopping in order to find jurisdictions with little to no protection, creating a type of ‘post-code lottery’. Fifthly, this lack of protection, coupled with the sizeable and ongoing investment involved, is likely to encourages prospective investors may decide to create their own businesses, rather than taking the costly and risky step of investing in a franchise. When investing in a franchise, the prospective franchisee is obliged not only to pay an advance to the franchisor, she is also obliged to make ongoing financial contributions to the franchisor -including royalty payments and advertising fees - and to purchase goods and equipment off the franchisor and their approved suppliers. Accordingly, rather than investing the advance in the franchise, a reluctant investor may decide to invest the funds in establishing her own business, especially when one bears in mind the fact that the average investment for franchisees is nearly double that for independent businesses.Sixthly, the lack of a disclosure regime during the negotiation of the contract, or the lack of a regime that stipulates the infrastructure and parameters of such disclosure, is likely to lead to misunderstanding and disagreements between the parties later on and may ultimately result in litigation and termination. Pre-contractual disclosure is likely to be beneficial to both parties by helping reconcile the expectations of the parties from the relationship. By providing the prospective investor with a comprehensive idea of her obligations as a franchisee, and the franchisor’s commitments, there is likely to be an alignment of expectations between the parties, reducing the scope for friction and litigation. Such an exchange of information is likely to result in a sustainable relationship, benefiting both parties.  Part three – Value of introducing an international regime governing mandatory disclosure  The average capital investment for franchisees is 110,000 USD. (Knight 1984: 57) This figure corresponds with figures in later research by Tuunanen & Hyrsky, which notes that In 60% of cases, the initial franchise fee is £8990 (GBP) or less and the average fee is £5850 (Tuunanen & Hyrsky 2001: 53-4)   The average royalty fee is 4.8% of sales for franchisees and the average advertising fee is 2.2% of sales for franchisees. (Knight 1984: 57) The royalty rate (as a percentage of sales) varies between none to over 9%. (Knight 1986: 9-10)  The average capital investment for franchisees is nearly double that for independent businesses, suggests Knight, with franchisees investing 110,000 USD compared to 57,000 USD which is the average investment made by independents. (Knight 1984: 57) In 60% of cases, the initial franchise fee is £8990 (GBP) or less and the average fee is £5850 (Tuunanen & Hyrsky 2001: 53-4)  ‘Markets work best when buyers are informed, disclosures inform them.’ The provision of information during the pre-contractual phase serves several goals, addressing the private interests of would-be franchisees, whilst also preserving and advancing wider market interestsAlso, such measures offer a win-win solution by balancing the often-competing needs of would-be franchisees and franchisors.  Mandatory disclosure resonates with the free market and autonomy principles; guaranteeing the freedom of would-be franchisees and franchisors to make decisions, preserving their freedom to choose, buy and contract. By securing the provision of pertinent, accurate and current information to the prior, whilst at the same time preserving the needs of the latter by helping preserve their ability to innovate, advertise and conclude deals which respond to market demands, without controlling the substance of the agreement itself which may curtail the franchisor’s ability to compete effectively on the marketplace.Protection of would-be franchisees Protection of would-be franchisees negotiating with out-of-state franchisors is achieved in a number of ways.Firstly, by obliging franchisors to provide pertinent, comprehensive, accurate and up to date information, such a regime aims to provide the would-be franchisee with the means to make a rational purchasing decision. To this end, information-based measures provide her with the opportunity and means to shop around, enabling her to compare the different offers available in the marketplace, as well as the contract terms proposed by each prospective franchisor, before extending her the time needed to go away and decide whether to buy a franchise, from whom and on what terms. Secondly, the provision of such information arguably elevates the would-be franchisee so that she is on par with the franchisor. One of the key aims of regulatory harmonization in the EU context is the desire to boost the confidence of the weaker contracting party, by guaranteeing her a uniform procedural and substantive infrastructure during the  Ben-Shahar 2014: 5.  Ben-Shahar 2014: 5; Howells 2005: 350  A full review of the value of mandatory disclosure can be found in Emerson and Meiselles 2021.  Howells 2018: 99; Purnhagen et al 2018: 158; Busch 2016: 221; Ben-Shahar 2014: 4-5; Weatherhill 2013: 93. C.f. Information facilitates rational wealth-maximising decision-making in turn facilitating the functioning of markets. (Grundmann 2002: 279; Busch 2016: 226)  Ben-Shahar 2014: 5; Busch 2016 : 223; Haupt 2003: 1139; Helberger 2011: 337, 345; Howells 2018: 97; Seizov 2017: 149. bargaining phase. Mandatory disclosure and the right of withdrawal are the main regulatory strategies used by the EUin this context. The right of withdrawal permits the weaker contracting party to exit the contract post formation, whilst mandatory disclosure obliges the stronger of the contracting parties to provide the weaker party with mandated information about the proposed deal no later than a stipulated number of days before the deal is concluded. Such information must be provided using a standardized form which highlights key fields of information thus ensuring easier comparison of such data. This procedure enables the disclosee to consider and compare the offer and the proposed terms with others on the marketplace. In addition, providing her with the means to seek professional advice. By way of analogue, the introduction of a harmonized body of regulation governing cross-border franchise deals will ensure that would-be franchisees have access to a defined and structured disclosure within a set period of time before the deal is concluded, in spite of the fact that the would-be franchisee’s place of business is in a state different to the state where the franchisor is operating.  Protection of would-be franchisors The protection of would-be franchisors negotiating with an out-of-state franchisee is achieved in a number of ways. Firstly, by regulating technical barriers and reducing market entry barriers, the costs of engaging in cross-border franchising are reduced, decreasing the overheads borne by those franchisors seeking international franchisees. By harmonizing the procedure and substance during the pre-contractual phase, predictability and transactional security are ensured. Secondly, in contrast with substance-based measures, information-based measures are viewed as a far more effective way of preserving the autonomy of parties to contract. Rather than regulation targeting economic behavior and controlling the substance of the contract, prices, advertising, the availability and infrastructure of franchises, mandatory disclosure offers an effective regulatory regime defining the time, place and manner of disclosure in a way that is far less onerous, clumsy and costly than the alternative.Market-based justifications  Purnhagen et al 2018: 158; Busch 2016: 221; Ben-Shahar 2014: 4-5; Weatherhill 2013: 93; Lusak 2021 : 243.  Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7.  Easterbrook 1984: 680, 685. See also Howells 2018: 97; Busch 2016: 222; Ben-Shahar 2014: 5. Beyond the benefits associated with having one ‘common’ code of rules – accessibility, clarity, the grouping together of different branches of law linked by common concepts, the ability to spot weaknesses in existing law enabling modernisation and a saving of the time, effort and money previously spent in ascertaining the state of the law, advising on I and complying with it – harmonisation of the rules of the various jurisdictions greatly facilitates interstate trade without which the burden of conducting business internationally would be intolerable.Mandatory disclosure preserves and advances public interests in a number of ways.  Firstly, such a regime goes a long way towards ensuring a variety of franchises are available on the marketplace, rather than reducing variety to either one possibility or a limited range of possibilities. Effectively, protecting the stream of franchises entering the market thus guaranteeing choice and bolstering effective competition. Franchising provides independent traders with the means to compete more effectively with large distribution undertakings, as the franchise set-up allows such traders to establish their outlets more rapidly and to operate with relative ease due to the infrastructure and support offered by the franchisor. Franchises also allow consumers and other end users a fair share of the benefit resulting from the association, providing them with access to a uniform network run by individuals who are personally invested in the operation of the outlet and personally interested in its efficient operation. The homogeneity of the network and the ongoing cooperation between the parties ensures a constant flow of products and services boosting interbrand and intrabrand competition.Secondly, by allowing would-be franchisees to protect themselves in line with their own individual choices, information-based remedies resolve the problem for a regulator of having to undermine the diverse preferences by imposing a common standard. By balancing the often competing interests of franchisors and would-be franchisees, mandatory disclosure is seen as a desirable cost reduction strategy by means of which society can underwrite the costs associated with searching for relevant information; mandatory disclosure helps ensure not only a larger quantity of information, but a better testing of its accuracy, improving allocative efficiency and  Goode 1988 : 137-8.  Grundmann 2002: 280; Nicolini 2006: 80.  This is the case with food labelling law which aims to ensure disclosure of all key ingredients in the food, allowing consumers to make informed decisions about the food they purchase and consume.  Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7; UNIDROIT Guide 2007: Ch 5, 11; Meiselles and Wharton 2018: 249-250.   Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7.   Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7.   Haupt 2003: 1140 ; Busch 2016: 222. implying a more productive economy by steering would-be franchisees to make better decisions. In a similar vein, Coffee asserts that greater inefficiency would exist without mandatory disclosure due to the excess public costs associated with searching and collating information, adding that ‘collectivization helps minimize the social waste that would otherwise result from the misallocation of economic resources to this pursuit.’ Informed would-be franchisees are not only better able to protect their own interests by making decisions that are autonomous and well-informed; they are also able to boost competition and to make socially responsible choices thus serving the general interest alongside their own. By providing would-be franchisees with information about the key features of a franchise, they are able to make fair and advantageous bargains, encouraging price and quality competition on the part of franchisors. At the same time, the rules on information ensure an interaction between offer and demand, promoting and facilitating functioning competition, whilst ensuring a choice for would-be franchisees reflecting their needs and interests. Beyond its ability to enhance competition in the marketplace, a mandatory disclosure regime arguably helps steer users towards purchasing choices which are more advantageous to them, this is achieved by providing would-be franchisees with information about the benefits of the franchise (the support and training offered by the franchisor) and its risks (the initial and ongoing costs).Information-based measures address information asymmetry without distorting markets; guarding against market failure whilst also removing barriers to market entry and introducing commercial know-how into countries - notably those with developing economies and with economies in transition. International franchising plays a key role in guaranteeing fruitful transfer of know-how and technology which may be bilateral as well as unilateral, benefiting both parties as well as their respective economies. Enhancing levels of inward investment, generating economic growth, creating jobs, enhancing infrastructures, and generating tax revenues. This strategy has the added benefit of indirectly raising standards on the marketplace and promoting transparency and honesty in the way that the contract is made and executed. Also, in contrast with measures that regulate market behavior, information-based  Lusak 2021: 243.  Coffee 1984: 722; Lusak 2021: 243.  Helberger 2011: 337, 343.  Helberger 2011: 342.

Howells 2018: 99-100. measures protect the ability of commerce to innovate and compete by allowing commerce to develop products that offer attractive features, as franchisors compete with each other to attract would-be franchisees. Disclosures protect buyers who ‘fear sellers’ rapacity and the perils of caveat emptor’ without distorting markets by setting prices, quality and terms.While earlier analysis regards informational asymmetry as a brute inequality in the information available to buyers and sellers, restoring the balance and eliminating the bargaining disadvantage, modern theory acknowledges the subtle and complex ways in which information affects market dynamics, recognizing the cost implications of this regime. A number of benefits are associated with the introduction of a mandatory disclosure regime. Such a regime not only helps address a number of concerns associated with the current regulatory structure - key amongst them regulatory disparity and the ensuing regulatory gap – it also helps streamline commerce by offering a consistent and unvarying framework applicable to identical transactions. Accordingly, ensuring substantive and procedural uniformity, whilst guaranteeing higher levels of transparency and transactional certainty, and helping lower transactional costs. Such a programme would go a long way towards encouraging higher levels of contracting as franchisors and franchisees are aware of their rights and obligations.  Howells 2005: 350, 355-6.  Ben-Shahar 2014/5.  Hadfield et al 1998: 141. Part four – Stepping up? Is this the type of project the UNCITRAL should be looking at? How can the UNCITRAL achieve this aim? Currently, the process of pre-contractual disclosure is addressed by disparate bodies of national law and non-legislative instruments, which means that often in cross-border negotiations of franchises there is no guarantee that prospective franchisees have access to key information needed in order to make an informed decision about the merits and risks of investing in the franchise. This lack of legal harmonization amongst the different jurisdictions is exacerbated by the absence of an international regime governing mandatory disclosure of information to would-be franchisees before the franchise agreement is concluded, meaning that enterprising franchisors may seek out jurisdictions with little to no protective regulation, engaging in sharp practices, whilst prospective franchisees have no means of securing key information and legal redress. The value of introducing an international regime is multifaceted. Benefiting the parties themselves, whilst also furthering public interests. In this final segment of my paper, I will look at whether the UNCITRAL can help formulate an information-based regulatory framework that helps protect the interests of prospective franchisees by optimising their investment decision-making process and the interests of the wider market by helping enhance cross-trade in franchises, before considering the ways in which this can be achieved.  The move to formulate a single body of ‘common’ law at an international level and in turn harmonise the rules of the different nations is almost as old as the modern idea of codifying law. Systems of non-state rules have co-existed for centuries with state laws in the field of cross-border relations, in some cases pre-dating these. As the different European nations were developing their respective codes, there was a recognition of the need for the development of a body of ‘common’ law amongst the nations, due to the ‘community of commercial relations’ between these nations. Bolstered by three distinct policy objectives supportive of an international system: an economic drive to facilitate international commerce, a political goal of increasing interstate cooperation and order, and a moral aim of avoiding parochialism and  Bonell 1978: 413.  Wai 2002: 215. Wai adds that legal historians have shown how the system of state law is a late arrival in this context; many types of business relations remain governed by non-legal rules such as custom and trade and by non-legal enforcement mechanism such as retention of security, and reputational damage. (Wai 2002: 215-6)  Bonell 1978: 413. promoting non-discrimination, the vision of such an international order, rooted in the traditions of international liberalism, promotes the development of rules, institutions and norms intended to convince individual nations to forfeit policies geared to short-term self-interest in a bid to achieve potential long-term cooperative benefits.Whilst this campaign was delayed during the world wars, after world war two there was a renewed interest in such projects. A number of efforts towards unification or at the very least harmonization of the laws of the various nations took place during this period, though these efforts focused on specific topics, such as the sale of goods, trade terms, agency, arbitration.Alongside the work of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), which has been instrumental in creating a non-legislative framework to govern franchise agreements, the United Nations – under the auspices of the UNCITRAL - has been at the vanguard of the campaign to formulate regimes governing key commercial transactions.Established by the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) in 1966, UNCITRAL is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly of the UN entrusted with the role of facilitating international trade and investment through a process of progressive harmonisation and unification of the law governing cross-border commerce. Acknowledging the fact that divergencies amongst the laws of different nations in matters relating to cross-border commerce are one of the key impediments to the development of world trade and ‘the flow of international trade’ and recognising the need for a coordinated approach coupled with broader participation, the UNCITRAL has formulated legislative and non-legislative texts governing many aspects of commercial law, amongst them the law governing the sale of goods which addresses the bargaining phase and controls the substance of the contract (subject to the right  Wai 2002: 224.  Attempts to realise this project failed when the Projet de code des obligations et des contrats drafted by a group of leading Italian and French lawyers and intended as a first step towards the formulation of a new jus commune of Europe, was dismissed by the Italian and French Governments. This draft included 739 articles subdivided into 20 sections addressing the law of obligations in general and specific contracts in detail including agency, employment, loans and sales.

Originally composed of 29 members, membership was expanded in 1973 (to 36 States) and in 2004 (to 60 States). (UNCITRAL website https://uncitral.un.org/en/about/faq/mandate_composition/history accessed 16/6/2020)   During the drafting process, participants include the Member States of the Commission, observer States alongside interested organisations (IGOs and NGOs) (UNCITRAL website https://uncitral.un.org/en/about/faq/mandate_composition/history (accessed 16/6/2020))  Acknowledging the need to ensure ‘adequate representation of the principal economic and legal systems of the world, and of developed and developing countries’, the UNCITRAL is structured to ensure the different geographic regions and key economic and legal systems are represented. (Article 1, Resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966) The five regional groups represented within the Commission are African States, Asian States, Eastern European States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States - UNCITRAL website https://uncitral.un.org/en/about/faq/mandate_composition/history (accessed 16/6/2020)   UNCITRAL’s work is performed at three different levels. (para 10, Factsheet) At the first level is the UNCITRAL itself, oftentimes referred to as the Commission, which carries out its work at the annual plenary sessions. At the second level are the Working Groups which undertake a large portion of the developmental work, working on the topics on the UNCITRAL’s work programme. (para 10, Factsheet) At the third level is the secretariat which supports the Commission and Working Groups. (para 10, Factsheet) At the Commission’s sessions, the Commission is tasked with finalising and adopting the draft texts referred to it by the working groups, for reviewing the working groups’ progress reports, for setting topics for future work or further research.

The bureau of the Commission which is elected at the start of each annual session by the member States and serves until the start of the next annual session, represents each of the 5 regions from which the members of the Commission are drawn. (para 10, Factsheet and Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Supplement No. 16 (A/7216) (1968), para. 14.) Conclusion Since the 1930s, firms have been using franchising as their preferred business model for expansion, first domestically and then internationally. The importance of cross-border franchises in the growth of international markets is acknowledged by the European Parliament, which also recognized the significance of harmonisation in this growth.The regulatory gap, resulting from a lack of an international regime governing mandatory disclosure during the bargaining phase, and the regulatory disparity, resulting from the disparities in the regulation available in different jurisdictions, is exacerbated by a number of other factors. Namely the concern of national regulators with domestic interests (rather than protecting interests abroad) and the lack of agreement amongst nations about standards and obligations, and the mechanisms for the effective enforcement of international rules.Enterprising franchisors and other international business actors are often adept at seeking out jurisdictions with little to no protective regulation. Effectively leaving weaker parties, such as would-be franchisees exposed. By engaging in, what Robert Wai calls, lift-off, such actors effectively remove the international business transaction from national regulatory oversight whilst freeing it from the regulation of domestic private law.Whilst contract law is often considered to the be the key to international transactions, capturing the ideal of promoting mutual promises in order to facilitate mutually beneficial transactions, regulation is often also motivated by considerations as to fairness between the parties; imposing limits on private ordering to ensure that basic conditions of voluntariness and adequate information are fulfilled. The motives for such regulation are varied, and encompass concerns about informational asymmetry, redressing the imbalance of power, paternalism and distributive fairness. Such regulation - governs the content of the contract – by imposing compulsory terms (governing for example jurisdiction and choice of law) and limiting the enforceability of exclusion clauses – as well as the pre-contractual phase. These protective measures are particularly poignant in the cross-border context, where as a result of lack of information, expertise and/or advice, many parties especially consumers or similar parties in a  EP Motion, para. 4.  Wai 2002 : 252.  Wai 2002: 212, 215.  Wai 2002: 237.  Wai 2002: 237.  Wai 2002: 237.. weaker position may not fully understand the full impact of clauses governing choice of law, choice of forum and arbitration clauses, when they appear in the a contract.To guarantee harmonization of the measures protecting would-be franchisees in international sales of franchises, I suggest UNCITRAL develop a body of regulation governing such sales.Inspired by the mandatory statutes used in the US, Canada, Australia and France and the model law developed by UNIDROIT - Model Franchise Disclosure Law (2002), such a regime should address the substance and procedure associated with pre-contractual disclosure. Firstly, the regime should oblige franchisors to provide would-be franchisees with a standard information pack in line with a defined procedural framework. Without information, choice becomes a torment. 95  Such information helps mitigate the sense of mental paralysis experienced or the tyranny of choice that is said to emerge from the sense of alienation and ineptness associated with choosing. 96 The imposition of a standard format and time of disclosure, thus goes a long way towards facilitating the comparative use of the information disclosed, helping create ‘an efficient disclosure language’.97 Accordingly, the UNCITRAL should give consider development of a standard information pack, facilitating such a comparative use of the information. Consisting of a standardised template document with defined fields of information - designed by the UNCITRAL for use in such transactions – and requiring the disclosure of supporting documentation by the franchisor audited accounts and predicted earnings for the outlet, alongside the draft franchise agreement and other key contracts. Such a pack should be accompanied by a statement of truth and should include the details of past and present franchisees, providing the would-be franchisee with the means to source references and to seek advice. Modelled on the Franchise Disclosure Document used in  Wai 2002: 237-8. This concern is recognized in international texts. The preliminary draft of the Hague Conference convention on jurisdiction and recognition of judgements illustrates this concern by excluding consumer and employment contracts from the general provision supporting forum-selection clauses. (Article 8, The Preliminary Draft Convention on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters was adopted by the Special Commission of the Hague Conference on October 30, 1999. Available at http://www.hcch.net/e/conventions/draft36e.html) Similarly, protective measures have been included in the Brussel Regulation (Recast) and Rome I which exclude consumers, employees and policy-holders from the general provisions that support forum selection and choice of law clauses (respectively).  Such a regime would govern the sale of franchises by a franchisor whose place of business is in a state different to that of the prospective franchisee, thus ensuring its applicability to cross-border transactions rather than domestic ones.   Hilton, Consumerism in 20-century Britain (2003), 268.  Hilton, Consumerism in 20-century Britain (2003), 268.  For this reason, a disclosure policy should also ban disclosure written disclosure of other information or oral variances, in order to root out novel methods of disclosure; such novelty may erode the utility of the disclosures in comparison, since ‘a firm could deny to investors in other firms the reciprocal advantages of disclosure by choosing to disclose things that were sufficiently unusual that the ordinary standards of comparison could not be employed.’ (Easterbrook 1984: 703) In securities regulation, for example, the standardisation of disclosure is achieved using the schedules which must be completed by each firm at defined times (Easterbrook 1984: 700-1). the United States, such a disclosure document would provide prospective franchisees with information about the obligations of the franchisor and its business credentials, the obligations and likely costs that a franchisee will incur alongside material information pertaining to the franchise itself, including details of the competitive nature of the market where the franchisee will be operating. Ultimately, such a disclosure would permit the prospective franchisee to make an informed decision about whether or not to enter into the franchise arrangement proposed, by enabling her to weigh-up the potential risks and benefits, so she is able to make a meaningful comparison with other investments.Secondly, the UNCITRAL should consider introducing of a procedural framework to accompany this disclosure obligation, with clear steps and stipulated deadlines. Amongst these, there should be an obligation on franchisors to furnish prospective franchisees with the information pack within a set period of time before execution of any binding franchise or the payment of consideration to the franchisor (whichever takes place first). By providing disclosure in advance of the date set for signing the agreement, prospective franchisees not only have the option of consulting with accountants, bankers and past as well as current franchisees, they also have an opportunity to seek specialised professional and legal advice on the investment, so they can seek guidance on the commercial and strategic information provided in the disclosure document, the terms of proposed franchise agreement and the precise benefits and risks associated with this arrangement. What is more this period acts as a cooling-off period, akin to the statutory periods provided in the context of consumer credit regulation. Such a move helps guarantee a level-playing field for franchisors and would-be franchisees by bringing some certainty to investors (franchisees), whilst instituting a framework which is similar to those used in other jurisdictions where the franchisor is operating thus ensuring consistency and reduced costs from the franchisor’s point of view. EP Motion, para. 20; GAO Report, 6.  §31119, California Corp. Code.  Franchisees often consult with others before signing the franchise agreement, though franchisees do not consult as many external sources as the franchisors claimed to recommend before the signing of the franchise agreement. (Knight 1986: 10) The key sources of information franchisees note are lawyers, existing franchisees, accountants and bankers. (Knight 1986: 10) This finding corresponds with later research by Morrison (1996) and Guillox et al (2004) which shows that a majority of respondents consult with current franchisees (77% for franchisees of the same network and 43% for franchisees of another network). (Guillox et al 2004: 219)  An important factor contributing to the satisfaction of franchisees is the range and quality of advice from external sources. (Hing 1995: 19) Hing found significant positive correlations between franchisee satisfaction and the helpfulness of advice received from legal counsel, accountants, bank managers, business consultants and other franchisees in the same network. (Hing 1995: 19) He also found a significant positive correlation between franchisee satisfaction and the number of helpful external advisors consulted. (Hing 1995: 19) Hing accordingly suggests that consulting a range of helpful external advisors before buying the franchise appears ‘to promote accurate pre-purchase expectations, which then increase post-purchase franchisee satisfaction.’ (Hing 1995: 19)  https://www.retailcouncil.org/advocacy/finance/british-columbia-uniform-franchise-legislation/ (accessed 25/6/2020) The leading concerns for franchisors expanding overseas are franchise management and staffing, by providing full information about the merits and risks associated with the franchise, franchisors can ensure that franchisees recruited are properly informed, ensuring the long-term retention of qualified personnel and the sustainability of the franchise. Whilst at the same time, reducing the potential for conflict Staffing, compatibility of interests and expectations and good communication are all important factors in the success of a franchise operation, benefiting the contracting parties and by extension the economy as a whole, whilst boosting cross-border commerce and trade.\n",

While the long battle for better regulations to protect new car dealers continues, the AAI is also witnessing major disruptions of its distribution model. In 2020, Holden abruptly left the Australian market and Honda along with Mercedes-Benz announced a switch to a new marketing channel-the agency model. In 2021, Renault has closed its Australian headquarters leaving its distribution in the hands of an independent distributor. All of which is calling for franchising scholars to pay closer attention to this important yet under-researched industry. To date, research has not yet offered a holistic perspective and industry-specific understanding of franchising based on social, contractual and institutional approaches altogether.  Based on a systematic literature review, we examine the dynamics of power and control in marketing channels, drawing on current evidence from franchising in the automotive industry worldwide. Subsequently, we highlight the importance of taking a three-dimensional approach (i.e. social, contractual, and institutional) when conducting empirical and industry-focused research in marketing channels. Moreover, we discuss franchising issues in the AAI and some of the aspects of the disruptive agency model recently adopted by Honda and Mercedes-Benz. Finally, we close with a reflection on the future of marketing channels in the automotive industry, promising an exciting research agenda in franchising and the yet under-researched agency model. Keywords: franchising; power and control; automotive industry; systematic review; regulationsINTRODUCTIONThe distribution channels of the automotive industry are witnessing a historical shift from franchising to an agency model in manycountries, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden. The agency model consists of transitioning a dealer principal from a franchisee to an agent acting on behalf of the car manufacturer – the latter will be able to sell through any direct marketing channel (i.e. online sales) and through the agents, who will receive a percentage of the profit. In Australia, Honda and Mercedes-Benz are advancingthe move to an agency model in 2021 and 2022 respectively (Newton, 2020). This significant transformation has occurred as a reaction to the technological disruption from online retail, requiring the traditional dealership franchised model to offer more flexibility and accessibility to customers. This shift to an agency model in Australia is motivated partly by regulatory pressure, considerable decreases in profitability and a global trend for disintermediation (Inampudi et al., 2019).  A country that will not be witnessing this change is the United States of America (USA).State laws for many years in the U.S. have prohibited company-owned automotive distribution channels in favour of product-tradename franchising (Stolze, 2014).  Recently, however, after a successful win to challenge the law in a number of state courts and legislatures, Tesla have been exclusively allowed to own and operate its own dealerships some U.S. states, with some states posing strong limitation to the number of stores that Tesla can own and operate (Young et al., 2020).  Even with this development, all other automotive manufacturer selling in the U.S, with the exception of Tesla, must sell via franchisees throughout the country, therefore hindering a car manufacturer’s ability to switch to the agency model (Lafontaine & Morton, 2010). The AAI, however, does not benefit from this degree of protection. In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) regulates the franchising sector for most industries, and, in recent years, this Code has been subject to large criticism by key players in the AAI, voicing concerns that the Code is not fit-for-purpose (DIIS, 2018; PJCCFS, 2019). For almost a century, franchising has been the most efficient and commonly used distribution model for the automotive industry worldwide. This model is administered via franchising contractual arrangements between car manufacturers (franchisors) and car dealers (franchisees) and is subject to legal frameworks that regulate the relationship between the two members. Today, about 30 countries have adopted specific state and federal laws to regulate franchising, including Australia, Canada, the USA, Spain and Italy (Milenkovic, 2010; UNIDROIT, 2013).  The automotive industry represents an important percentage of retail revenues in many countries and contributes to the economy by generating profits, establishing small businesses such as dealerships and creating a large number of jobs (Almohri et al., 2019; Beer, 2018). Since the winding up of car manufacturing operations in Australia, automotive industryrevenue is now heavily reliant on its domestic retail activities. The AAI is dominated by foreign manufacturers, using a typical franchising distribution system comprising dealers. The latter are running either single-brand dealerships, by trading exclusively with one car manufacturer, or multi-brand dealerships, by trading with more than one car manufacturer.  In Australia, the automotive industry is an important market with 53,104 businesses operating, providing 284,000 jobs – 20 per cent of which are working in dealerships – and generating A$13 billion to Australia’s economy (AADA, 2020; Yin Huey, 2020). However, recent issues governing the relationship between channel members keep arising, generating concerns in this industry. In fact, commercial arrangements in the AAI are causing a number of franchising issues governing the relationship between car manufacturers and their authorised dealers. Interestingly, relatively little is known about the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer networks in Australia (Clibborn et al., 2016; Parment, 2008). In a report investigating the automotive industry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC, 2017) shared that many challenges faced by dealers are a result of the use of power by car manufacturers. Furthermore, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (PJCCFS) raised concerns around these challenges, which led to an ongoing questioning of the suitability of the Code in protecting new car dealers from the apparent abuse of power and control of some car manufacturers (PJCCFS, 2019).  While this historical shift towards the agency model in the AAI is now occurring, there is little understanding of the relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer networks. Specifically, little is documented on how power and control manifest in the automotive industry and how it can affect the relationship between car dealers and their franchisors. There is also a limited understanding around the world about how laws designated to regulate franchising can affect the operational relationship between franchisors and franchisees in general or within a specific industry (Lafontaine & Morton, 2010; Spencer, 2010; Stolze, 2014).  This conceptual paper focuses on power and control in automotive franchising, drawing upon evidence in the broader marketing channels literature. A systematic search analysis is conducted to collect and review the available research on the subject. Following this, available information from the AAI and the issues related to power and control in this franchising distribution model is presented and compared with other countries such as Spain, Italy, Canada, the USA and Turkey. Finally, directions for future research in marketing channels is provided, including the franchising model administered in the automotive industry and its disruptor – the agency model. Research Background  A great deal of attention has been paid to the aspects of power and control prevalent in marketing channel relationships. The literature is rich with evidence regarding the dark side of intra-channel relationships in which the abuse of power and control are exerted by a ‘channel captain’ to maximise the potential of this distribution channel (Parment, 2008). Hunt and Nevin (1974) were the first to establish a conceptual framework for the study of power in marketing channels. In this sense, non-coercive sources of power refer to channel member A employing either reward, legitimate, referent and/or expert powers (French & Raven, 1959) to provide support and assistance to channel member B. The latter is cooperating and complying with the actions undertaken by channel member A, assuming a co-operative process is established. Coercive power exists when channels A and B are interdependently functioning, and channel member A retains the ability to punish channel member B (Hunt & Nevin, 1974). The phenomenon of power is clearly represented in the franchise system, a contractual mode in which franchisors are favoured with a power permitted by the franchise contract (Atwell & Buchan, 2014).  Understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the franchisor and franchisee is crucial for achieving positive outcomes for both parties. This has been a core focus of franchising scholarship. Certainly, there is a traditional power and control imbalance embedded in the franchising relationship which often leads to major issues between the franchisor and franchisee (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Frazer et al., 2007; Lafontaine & Shaw, 2005; Lusch, 1976; Maloni & Benton, 2000). In fact, this power and control imbalance in favour of the franchisor has become a generally accepted view. In this regard, Coughlan et al. (2006, p. 560) confirmed that “franchising is inherently asymmetric, with the franchisee being highly dependent on the franchisor”.  Since franchising relies on both positive economic and social interactions to succeed (El-Ansary, 1992; Stern & Reve, 1980), it involves a mutual interdependence to co-create value                                                              Throughout this research paper, channel member A refers to the franchisor.   Throughout this research paper, channel member B refers to the franchisee. with complex and individual needs expressed by both parties. While the franchisees manifest a constant desire for entrepreneurial independence, franchisors pursue a continuous control of the system to protect the uniformity of the brand (Kidwell et al., 2007). Such divergence in goals, along with actions displaying the franchisor’s abuse of power and control over franchisees, can trigger frustration for both channel members (El-Ansary, 1992; Stern & Reve, 1980). Consequently, issues between channel members are inevitable and, in some cases, neither pre-determined contract clauses nor mediation can repair them, leaving channel members facing possible legal action.  Given the potential for franchise contracts to work in favour of the franchisor and if franchising relationships are unbalanced (Hoy et al., 2017; Parment, 2008), it is often the role of the country’s regulators to mediate conflicts that arise from the unstable relationship between franchisors and their franchisees. Beyond being a popular form of economic organisation, franchising is also an instrument of the law. The main purpose of franchising regulation is to monitor the relationship between channel members under a franchise agreement (Lim & Frazer, 2002). In Australia, the Code is the only legal framework for franchising among all industries, with the exception of the petroleum industry (Spencer, 2010). Although the Code has been regulating the franchising sector since 1998 and has been subject to several reviews to improve it, complications between franchisors and franchisees persist. In fact, in Australia, 25 per cent of business format franchisors were involved in a dispute with their franchisees during 2016, with 7 per cent of these cases subject to litigation and 8 percent under investigation by the Fair Work Commission (Frazer et al., 2016). Thus, concerns regarding the suitability of the Code and the way it impacts the franchise relationship and industry’s performance as a whole, have raised the attention of both scholars and practitioners (Terry & Lernia, 2009).It is noticeable that researchers, when investigating the dynamics of power and control in the franchising relationship, often fail to identify which franchising model is being studied between the two most common ‘product and trade name’ and ‘business format’ franchising models (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Perrigot et al., 2019; Rosenbloom, 2013; Shaikh et al., 2018). This remains an important distinction to make since the difference between these types lies in the business system provided to the franchisees and therefore changes the nature of the relationship and the perceived power and control dynamics between both parties (Rosenbloom, 2013). While product and trade name franchising only authorises franchisees to resell the franchisor’s product/service, business format franchising grants the franchisee a business system, which includes the know-how to successfully conduct the business (Mendelsohn, 2005). Product and trade name franchising was the first distribution model to expand worldwide in the 20 century, with the arrival of the automotive industry. Yet, recent studies mostly focus on business format franchising, the commonly used model for most industries, such as clothing, fast food and hospitality, with limited studies conducted on the product and trade name franchising model – few of which have focused on the automotive industry and those that do focus mainly on the USA, Canada, and Europe (Aboyoun, 2016; Arruñada et al., 2001; Davey-Rafer, 1998; Ennew et al., 1993; Zanarone, 2008).  However, to our knowledge, no study to date has drawn a connection between the specific regulatory framework for franchising, its effect on the contractual agreement and consequently the influence both will have on franchising relationships within the automotive industry. To this end, a systematic review of marketing channel scholarship on power and control is conducted, focusing on the franchising model and drawing on evidence from the findings available on the automotive industry. This systematic literature review (SLR) offers scholars a timeline, tracing the evolution of the role and impact that power and control have on marketing channel relationships. Moreover, it identifies the need to delve deeply into the franchising triangle – legal, contractual and relational – with industry-specific research on franchising. Finally, this work provides a starting point for further research to enrich and progress the understanding of franchising relationships. METHODOLOGYUsing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, this study assembles key scientific contributions on the topic of power and control in the marketing channels and franchising scholarship. Initially adopted from the medical science discipline (Parris & Peachey, 2013), the SLR methodology is used to search, collect and select scientific contributions on a given topic by following a methodical and reliable process and offering greater research quality (Jahan et al., 2016). In fact, when compared to a traditional literature review, the search and selection stages of the SLR are based on objective inclusion criteria, hence decreasing the researcher’s bias and increasing the reliability and quality of the SLR.  Moreover, the SLR process is not only predominantly free of researcher bias but is also replicable given its transparent and thoroughly descriptive process (Dada, 2018; Tranfield et al., 2003; Weed, 2005). Such a methodology has already been used in marketing channels and franchising research (Dada, 2018; Mani et al., 2019; Nijmeijer et al., 2014). For this SLR, the authors followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to guide the methodological design. While PRISMA was initially developed for systematic reviews in health sciences, this checklist is also applicable to different disciplines and research foci, such as business and management (Easterby-Smith et al., 2018). Using PRISMA enables the researcher to achieve quality and transparency in terms of both the design and the reporting of the systematic review process (Tricco et al., 2018). Literature Search Process A systematic search of key databases was performed in May 2020. This paper focuses on the aspect of power and control in franchising, given that franchising is the dominant marketing channel used in the automotive industry worldwide. While the authors’ discussion is mainly drawn from the literature on the topic of power and control in the broader marketing channel literature, a particular focus during this systematic search is directed towards franchising scholarship. Hence, a preliminary search using the words ‘power and/or control’, ‘marketing channels’, and ‘franchising’ in ProQuest was conducted to determine a list of key terms that would best align with the research topic. The literature results were screened, and the authors concluded that since this initial search query was yielding a large set of available literature on the topic, the list of keywords would need to be expanded but limited to the use of Boolean operators only. This search strategy is deemed to sufficiently cover the research subject (Nijmeijer et al., 2014; Tranfield et al., 2003). Accordingly, the entry (power AND/OR control) remained unchanged, and the keywords (“marketing channel” OR “distribution channel”) and (franchising OR franchise) were used to collect the available literature on the research topic. The ProQuest systematic search was scripted as (franchise AND (control OR power)) AND (franchising AND (control OR power)) AND (“marketing channel” AND (control AND power)) AND (“marketing channels” AND (control AND power)) AND (“distribution channel” AND (control and power)) AND (“distribution channels” AND (control and power)) AND (franchising AND (control and power)) AND (franchise AND (control and power)). The above search queries were run in ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science databases, with only minor adjustments to the entry query due to the databases’ different coding systems. No publication date was delimited during this search query, and the results for each database were exported to a formatted Excel file with a total of 638 references. Following the removal of duplicates, the database was reduced to 408 references.  Selection Process To reduce the number of errors and the risk of bias,the study selection was conducted in a systematic manner based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria sheet. The latter was established prior to the systematic literature database search. Both the inclusion and exclusion criteria sheet and the study selection were reviewed and approved by two academic experts in the field. This process contributed to limiting the search, duplication, exclusion, inclusion and selection bias,therefore contributing to the quality of the systematic search and the selection outcome (Jahan et al., 2016). Table 1 outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria with specific examples of studies found within the database search results. Table 1. List of inclusion and exclusion criteria After the identification process was completed, two cross-checks of the literature were conducted. The first was a reference cross-check of a sample of the identified articles which were selected based on the most recent publication dates. The second cross-check was with a database within the reference manager software Zotero. This database of references contained literature on the same research topic and was managed by one of the researchers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to this database prior to cross-checking. The outcome of these cross-checks contributed to adding 17 more articles to screen for further eligibility. Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flow diagram from the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies. It illustrates the reporting of the literature selected for the SLR. Figure 1. The PRISMA flow diagramThe selection process was initially conducted following a comprehensive understanding of the articles’ titles and abstracts, along with a screening of journal publications. When this was not conclusive, the full text of the article was read to confirm the inclusion or exclusion decision. Papers which focused on other inter-organisational arrangements and unrelated topics within the marketing channel scope were discarded.  Selected Literature The final outcome of this search strategy resulted in 31 journal articles on power and control from the marketing channel or franchising literature. Table 2 shows that a majority of the studies were on franchising (=19) with the remaining focusing on other forms of marketing channels. Moreover, 22 studies involve empirical research methodologies: eight using qualitative methods, 13 studies involving quantitative methods, and one study based on mixed methods. The majority of studies focus on power only (=12). A further 11 studies focus on both power and control, and eight studies discuss the concept of control only. Furthermore, out of the 31 studies, only four focus on the automotive industry, with the most recent published in 2008, while the other two remaining articles were published in 1976, 1986, and 1993 respectively. A preliminary synthesis of the articles selected from the systematic search is conducted, focusing on findings related to power and control in marketing channels and franchising. The 31 articles are classified based on the industry focus- retail and food are the most dominant industries and an important gap on power and control in automotive-industry-specific research can be observed. Details of the 31 articles including key findings is available on request. DATA ANALYSIS Marketing channels as a research field strongly interacts with diverse intellectual disciplines such as management, economics, finance and law. Franchising specifically has a high degree of interaction with these disciplines as researchers often use this distribution model to contextualise their studies and empirically test their research questions (Barthélemy, 2011; Combs et al., 2009; Gabrielsen & Roth, 2009; Michael, 2000). In such instances, researchers use a qualitative content analysis in the systematic review of academic studies (Cetindamar et al., 2009; Tranfield et al., 2003). Similarly, this present study employs the content analysis technique to systematically review the scientific contributions on power and control in marketing channels.  The purpose of content analysis is to categorise the information from the selected literature in key themes along with sub-categories and quantify the instances when each key theme is linked to an individual sub-category (Dada, 2018; Silverman, 2013, p. 443).  For instance, a key theme in this research is the concept of ‘power’, the sub-categories for this key theme being ‘non-coercive power’, ‘coercive power’, ‘countervailing power’ and ‘legitimate power’. Another example is the key theme ‘control’, with the sub-categories of ‘control mechanism’ and ‘perceived control’. In some instances, sub-categories were also divided. For example, the sub-category ‘control mechanism’ was separated into ‘authoritative mechanism’ and ‘contractual mechanism’. Finally, the quantification of this categorisation was undertaken following the number of times the key themes were evoked, the key themes and individual sub-themes were discussed and, where relevant, the key themes, the sub-themes and the further categorisation in the sub-theme were analysed. The categorisation and quantification of the literature are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. Structure of codingThe coding process described above was undertaken using the qualitative analysis software CAQDAS NVivo 12 Plus. This software facilitated the formulation of the content analysis thematic by providing quantification of recurrent topics, which formed the codes, creating links between the codes and the article in the database. This process contributed to forming a preliminary list of sub-themes and, finally, narrowing down the analysis to research streams predominantly occurring in the topic of power and control in marketing channels. RESULTS A significant portion of the literature on power in marketing channels focuses on comparing the effect of coercive and non-coercive sources of power when exerted by a channel member on the overall channel relationship, including satisfaction, performance and the commitment of channel members (Benton & Maloni, 2005; Frazer et al., 2007; Lusch, 1976). A dominant research stream on control in marketing channels focuses on two main sources of control – outcome and behaviour control (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Lafontaine & Shaw, 2005; Mellewigt et al., 2011) – with an emphasis on the relationship between perceived control and power (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Dant, 2008; Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Perrigot et al., 2019). In this section, the concepts of power and control in marketing channels will be reviewed, with a particular focus on examining these concepts in vertically integrated channels (i.e. franchising), drawing on some examples from the automotive industry worldwide.  Power in Marketing Channels Empirical and conceptual research has contributed to a great understanding of the inherent presence of power in channel relationships (Frazer et al., 2007; Hingley, 2005b; Maloni & Benton, 2000; Sheu & Hu, 2009b). Hunt and Nevin (1974) developed a conceptual framework for the sources of power in channel distribution. The sources of power accessible by channel members consist of coercive and non-coercive (i.e. legitimate, expert, reward and referent) sources of power. Both sources of power were empirically tested within a vertically integrated channel (i.e. franchising) in the context of the food industry in the USA. Hunt and Nevin (1974) concluded that the franchisor held predominantly coercive sources of power, with its use negatively correlated with the satisfaction levels of franchisees operating within the franchise system.  This finding was reiterated in the context of the US automotive industry. In fact, Lush (1976) found that coercive sources of power not only decreases satisfaction for new car dealers in the distribution system but also contributes to conflict, as the car manufacturer who possesses and exerts this source of power retains the ability to punish the new car dealers. Conversely, non-coercive sources of power provide support and assistance and therefore contribute to an increase in satisfaction levels for new car dealers. When referring to non-coercive sources of power and their benefit to channel relationships, legitimate power is one that surfaces often.  In the context of franchising, Frazer et al. (2007) found that when the franchisee realises and accepts the legitimate power held by the franchisor, the relationship has a better chance of succeeding. In fact, Sheu and Hu (2009b) reinforce the same statement based on their findings that legitimate power positively correlates with the commitment between channel members to succeed collectively. More recently, Shaikh et al. (2018) concluded that legitimate power contributes to creating perceived fairness in franchising relationships, an essential value to a productive partnership in marketing channels.  An early empirical study demonstrated a relationship between sources of power and performance within a channel system. Sibley and Michie (1981) found that non-coercive sources of power exerted by channel member A contributed positively to the perceived performance of channel member B. The latter conceives such use of power, specifically expert sources of power, as a form of support. However, the use of power alone is not sufficient to achieve a higher level of performance. In this sense, Sheu and Hu (2009b) discovered that if channel member A needs resources from channel member B, a collaboration of both parties will be primordial, regardless of whether channel member A has power in their favour. Similarly, Ranfagni and Guercini (2014), in their case study, conclude that when mutual benefit exists, the collaboration, commitment, and communication (3Cs) is a favourable mechanism to adopt. In effect, the 3Cs not only takes over sources of power but also contributes to decreasing conflict between channel members. Finally, the effect of power on levels of performance was also dismissed by other researchers. In fact, Shaikh et al. (2018) found that perceived fairness is the one relational aspect contributing to channel performance. This was particularly elaborated in the franchise channel, with Shaikh et al. (2018) finding that the use of coercive power by franchisors reduces franchisees’ perceptions of fairness, which then decreases the channel performance. Such findings have greatly contributed to academic knowledge by offering a greater understanding of power and its effect on satisfaction, conflict and performance in marketing channels.  However, Gaski (1984) detected conceptual and methodological issues related to some of the findings described above (Hunt & Nevin, 1974; Lusch, 1976; Sibley & Michie, 1981). His key point is that researchers did not differentiate clearly between the existence of sources of power and the application of these sources of power when investigating their effect on channel relationships (Gaski, 1984). The assumption that one does not equal the other needs to be acknowledged (Benton & Maloni, 2005; Frazer et al., 2007; Hunt & Nevin, 1974). Gaski (1984) also suggests that researchers should obtain a much deeper understanding of the sources of power when applied by a channel member. In any event, if channel member A exerts a coercive source of power to request channel member B to undertake costly staff training, channel member B may either abide by or deviate in some ways from the request; both options depend on the levels of countervailing power that channel member B possesses.  In the last two decades, countervailing power disappeared from the empirical and conceptual research in marketing channels, leaving the attention limited to coercive and non-coercive sources of power. However, interesting work was conducted by Ketilson (1991) and Mallen (1978) on the role of countervailing power in marketing channels. Ketilson (1991) describes countervailing power as a mix between legitimate power and legal power. In fact, in a retailing–wholesaling system, countervailing power enables both retailers and wholesalers to maintain harmony in their marketing channel by managing conflict at different levels of the channel. Such a finding is unique to the retailing–wholesaling system where small and large businesses co-operate with a high level of control, where they are required to maintain similar standards for both retailers and wholesalers (Ketilson, 1991).  A different yet equally important perspective was offered by Mallen (1978). He considers the marketing channel as an institutional system with societal issues, which result from the presence and application of channel power. Mallen believes that in any institutional system, countervailing power plays the role of a regulatory framework and adjusts the impact of those societal issues. Mallen (1978) particularly elaborated the institutional perspective in the context of franchising. He concluded that societal issues in the franchising institution could be reduced if the sources of power leading to information dissemination and unilateral contract termination were regulated through countervailing powerThe presence of any source of power may arise from different situations occurring within a marketing channel. Lederhaus (1984) was the first to explain that interdependence, an inherent part of channel relationships, traces the first form of power. In the same fashion of Mallen (1978), Lederhaus (1984) considers sources of power within the institutional system (i.e. marketing channels), where channel member A and channel member B work inter-dependently, occupy different functions and have common and distinct objectives. She suggests that in an institution where the number of channel members B is large, channel member A will possess less power than an institution in which the number of channel members B is reduced. Lederhaus’ (1984) conceptual paper is the first to discuss bargain power in marketing channels.  There is still debate about which power (i.e. coercive and non-coercive) is most beneficial to reduce the consequences of conflict and create a better control system in marketing channels. However, Frazier and Summers (1986) explain that within the franchise channel administered in the US automotive industry, car manufacturers tend to see positive results when they use coercive sources of power in a critical situation (i.e. economic crisis), and where the initial application of non-coercive sources of power did not lead new car dealers to respond accordingly. In fact, empirical results in this research found that the sources of power in franchising relationships within the automotive industry emanate from the dependence of new car dealers on that relationship; that is, a higher dependence of new car dealers results in higher sources of power for car manufacturers.  Similarly, Ennew et al. (1993) found that in the Turkish automotive industry, the franchise channel automatically gives power to car manufacturers through the formal contractual agreement and the commercial nature of the industry. In their study, they focus on the effect of sources of power on control, which will be further developed in the next section on control in marketing channels. Likewise, Doherty and Alexander (2006) emphasise the importance of consistency in using sources of power. They believe that in franchising relationships, if power is in favour of the franchisor, it is important to stay consistent by using either coercive or non-coercive sources of power and to ensure that coercive sources of power are not abandoned in addressing critical situations as they arise.  The relationship between power and dependence of channel members was also a subject of research for Hingley (2005a, 2005b). In his first attempt, Hingley conceptually explains why power asymmetry is not a threat to performance. Rather, he believes that power asymmetry can be profitable for both parties if self-interest is sought in a co-operative manner, therefore leading to a successful relationship. Hence, Hingley (2005a) encourages the tolerance of power in asymmetric channel relationships and questions the pre-established ingredients of a successful channel relationship (i.e. trust and mutuality) which are in their essence conditional due to the commercial nature of the channel relationship.  The above statements were further reinforced in Hingley’s (2005b) empirical testing, which showed positive outcomes in relation to the use of power when cooperativeness is prevalent in the relationship, whereas excessive use of power is destructive. Such findings are further supported in a number of studies (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Frazer et al., 2007). Furthermore, Quinn (1999) found that the use of power by a channel member is not the main source of conflict in channel relationships. Rather, channel members’ expectations, particularly the franchisees’ unmet expectations in terms of support received from their franchisors, is the main contributor to conflictFrom a franchisor’s perspective, at the beginning of the relationship, some offers of support to a franchisee have a lifecycle and this level of support will be reduced when the franchisee acquires the knowledge transfer and experience. Whether franchisees realise such support will be reduced (or in some cases terminated) when the relationship matures depends on the due diligence they conduct prior to entering the franchise agreement. (Weaven et al., 2010).  A co-dependant franchisee may perceive the decline of support as alarming and will therefore request more assistance from the franchisor. Alternatively, a franchisee with higher entrepreneurial needs may perceive an abundance of support as too controlling and thereby may welcome a decline in support from the franchisor. The next section aims to explain how control is perceived differently by franchisees and how its mechanisms evolved into variant forms and for different purposes. Control in Marketing Channels Control in marketing channels has been of great interest to academics who study channel relationships (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Ennew et al., 1993; Quinn, 1999). In fact, the way channel members perceive control has enabled researchers to detect the various control mechanisms exerted by the channel captain. Control over the distribution channel is a natural response from the channel captain looking to protect their distribution system. However, participants’ perceptions of control may affect their level of satisfaction with the distribution system (Frazer et al., 2007). This is of particular relevance in franchising as the franchisor may engage in controlling behaviours to ensure that the franchise network complies with the marketing plan and that the franchise system is delivering consistent levels of quality and value through different franchisees (Boulay, 2010).  In fact, similar to expert sources of power, a form of expert control was noted by Anand (1987) when he analysed the process by which franchisees evaluate their own performance. In his study, Anand (1987) found that franchisees attribute their performance based on the performance of their franchisor and accredit their success to the franchisor’s leadership. Such findings suggest that a franchisor with a successful franchise model holds a range of controls to exert, which could also be perceived positively by channel members (Anand, 1987). This finding was confirmed later in other empirical research conducted by Mohr et al. (1996) whoobserved that control used by the franchisor had a positive effect on the relationship. In this case, the franchisor possessed a high expert source of power in the industry and exerted control, which was positively perceived by the franchise network. However, in some instances, higher levels of control decreased the authority and autonomy of channel members who desired more freedom to exercise their commercial activities, which resulted in a decrease in satisfaction (Mohr et al., 1996). The result of this research posits an important reflection- Is the aftermath of control exercised by the franchisor is determined only based on the levels of dependence and cooperation of the franchisee, which may ultimately affect differently the satisfaction of the latter?  In the Canadian automotive industry, Levy Mangin et al. (2008) found that a car dealer with high level of dependence on a car manufacturer cooperates more than a car dealer with lower level of dependence. To increase dependence and cooperation, communication is deemed a critical attribute. This finding was challenged in another research on franchising leading to further importance given to nurturing dependence in a channel system (Frazer et al., 2007).  In fact, the more dependant the franchisee is on the franchise system, the more control the franchisor has, and the more support the franchisee expects from the franchisor (Frazer et al., 2007). While dependence may be seen as beneficial to a controlling channel member, it can also bring its troubled dynamics to the system- Particularly when less support is offered to a franchisee who has become too dependent on the franchisor’s support (Quinn, 1999; Sheu & Hu, 2009a). In this sense, transitioning from an initially highly dependent to a more interdependent franchising relationship can create dissatisfaction in franchisees, who may in some instances exit the franchise system (Frazer et al., 2007). These findings show that communication and dependence can become a double-edged sword if mishandled. In fact, while they can be a good combination to increase the franchisor’s control, careful consideration should be taken to ensure franchisee’s satisfaction (therefore commitment and performance) is still achieved. In the Turkish automotive industry, the commercial nature of this relationship, based on franchising, and the contractual clauses between car manufacturers and their dealers suggest that close control is demonstrated by the car manufacturer (Ennew et al., 1993). The outcome of the control dynamics in this franchise relationship suggests that dealers perceive control as detrimental when the car manufacturer uses coercive sources of power but as beneficial when control is exerted through non-coercive sources of power (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Ennew et al., 1993).  Franchising remains an interesting marketing channel to explore the concept of control. In a recent research article, different levels of control were observed within different forms of governance in franchising (i.e. master development franchising and joint venture franchising) with comparison to a wholly-owned marketing channel (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017). The levels of control tend to fluctuate depending on the levels of environmental uncertainty, and will, therefore, influence what distribution channel the franchisor will use to expand activities (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017). These environmental uncertainties include economic, institutional and behavioural factors.  Behavioural uncertainty raises agency issues unique to channel relationships. When expanding in heterogeneous host countries, franchisors are faced with differing degrees of work ethic, labour laws, professional qualifications and capacity of local staff. Therefore, a wholly-owned marketing channel is the least efficient distribution mode with consideration to the costs it incurs. Rather, joint venture franchising and master development franchising, which offer lower control over the channel, are the preferred mode for the franchisor (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017; Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011). Moreover, if institutional uncertainty is high and the franchise activities are based on product and trade name franchising rather than business format franchising, master development franchising is a less appropriate arrangement (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017; Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011). Undoubtedly, current governmental investigation into the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and dealers create an important level of institutional uncertainty. However, it remains unclear whether some overseas car manufacturers are acting on it with the exit of Holden, the move to the agency model by Honda and Mercedes-Benz, and most recently Renault choosing to outsource its retail activities to a local distributor.  Control can either contribute or prevent opportunistic behaviour in marketing channel relationships (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Mellewigt et al., 2011). To understand this statement, it is important to look at the numerous control mechanisms exercised in marketing channels.  The first framework of control mechanism in the organisational system was developed by management scholars in the 1970s (Ouchi, 1979). This framework comprised three control mechanisms observed in an organisational setting: market mechanismsbureaucratic mechanisms and clan mechanisms. Invariably, these control mechanisms were introduced as tools utilised by the organisation for the management and supervision of employees and complex tasks within and between organisations (Ouchi, 1979). In 1995, Weitz and Jap were the first to borrow this management framework and apply it to marketing channels. Market, bureaucratic and clan mechanisms were renamed as authoritativecontractual and normative control mechanisms (Weitz & Jap, 1995). This set of control mechanisms is used by channel members – generally the channel captain – to harmonise or dictate the norms of their relationship with their distribution network. The differentiation between each type of control mechanism relies on the importance of ensuring adequate control mechanisms are employed for the appropriate distribution channel (Weitz & Jap, 1995). In essence, any control mechanism also requires the participation of one (unilateral) member or both (bilateral) members to be exercised within the marketing channel (Heide, 1994). Therefore, control takes multiple effects depending on who exercised it and whether the subject took part of it.   authoritative control mechanism is observed when the status of channel members gives them the power to control another channel member (Weitz & Jap, 1995). Authoritative control is applied through non-coercive sources of power. A channel member with less expertise in the market or resources to operate efficiently will be more dependent on the channel captain, giving the latter a range of opportunities to control the activities of the less experienced party (expert power) (Gaski, 1984; Weitz & Jap, 1995). The authoritative control mechanism is unilateral as control shifts in favour of one party only, while the weakest party must abide by the rules imposed on them. The unilateral nature of this control mechanism was partially supported in the Canadian automotive industry, as non-coercive sources of power exercised by car manufacturers appear to increase dealers’ cooperation (Lévy Mangin et al., 2008)- However, no link between the perception of authoritative control and cooperation is to be found.  normative control mechanism is an implicit principle, a lesson learnt through past experience with the channel captain, the nature of organisational culture adopted by the channel captain, their reputation or any other shared beliefs within the channel system (Weitz & Jap, 1995). All of these factors consequently alter the relational norms between the parties involved (Deshpande, & Webster, 1992; Weitz & Jap, 1995). To exemplify the normative control mechanism, consider the following hypothetical situation: a car dealer requires training and support for a technical repair of a vehicle. However, the car dealer knows that they cannot be straightforward in their request to receive more training and support from the car manufacturer. Instead, the car dealer needs to approach the request by showing how beneficial this support was when and if they received it in the past without asking for it. In fact, the dealer’s experience with the car manufacturer has shown this is the best strategy to communicate and receive positive outcomes from the car manufacturer regarding requests for more support. Because of the implicit nature of the normative control mechanism, the relationship dynamic in the channel system can become critical (Weitz & Jap, 1995). For instance, because of the company’s organisational culture, channel member A does not welcome the input of channel member B when it comes to strategic organisational plans. Hence, channel member B is expected to know and accept that they will not be consulted on the decision to adopt a new sales strategy, even though they are directly impacted by such a strategy. Because it is expected of channel member B to understand and accept these implicit principles, this form of control mechanism is bilateral. The normative control mechanism is by far the least researched form of control mechanism in marketing channels. This is possibly due to its tacit and case-by-case display in marketing channels (Deshpande, & Webster, 1992; Heide & John, 1992; Weitz & Jap, 1995). In marketing channels, control can become a legal right prescribed through the contractual agreement between channel members. This is particularly observed in the contractual channel structure, such as franchising. In effect, a franchise is a legal contractual agreement between the franchisor and its franchisees. In some cases, the country’s legal framework may stipulate the control ownership in the franchising relationship (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). In Australia, the Code instructs that a franchise agreement is an agreement in which: …a person (the franchisor) grants to another person (the franchisee) the right to carry on the business of offering, supplying or distributing goods or services in Australia under a system or marketing plan substantially determined, controlled or suggested by the franchisor or an associate of the franchisor… (Franchising Code of Conduct, 2014, Clause 5[1b], emphasis added).  contractual controlmechanism consists of utilising the written agreement between the channel members to incorporate clauses which aim to control one party and dictate specific actions the latter must undertake to fulfil their responsibilities towards the channel captain (Weitz & Jap, 1995). Unlike the authoritative control mechanism, the contractual control mechanism is an explicit and formal form of control found in the contractual terms giving the controlled party an opportunity to negotiate the control term or reward in exchange for abiding by the contractual terms (Marie et al., 2014).   Undoubtedly, in the automotive industry, a dealer’s efficiency and effectiveness are key factors for car manufacturers to gain and maintain leverage and compete in the market (Almohri et al., 2019). Two studies conducted in Italy and Spain provide evidence of car manufacturers engaging in contractual control to ensure the dealer’s activities are aligned with what the company wants to achieve (Aboyoun, 2016; Almohri et al., 2019)In this sense, dealer agreements were deemed imbalanced as information regarding the responsibilities of the dealer are exhaustively detailed, whereas the obligations of car manufacturers toward the dealer network seem to be only vaguely detailed, leaving the opportunity for the car manufacturer to unilaterally change its responsibilities towards its dealer network (Arruñada et al., 2001; Zanarone, 2008).  In franchising, any precautionary attempt to control the marketing channel network is defined as a feed-forward control mechanism (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Langfield-Smith, 1997). A feed-forward control mechanism is any action undertaken by the franchisor to minimise opportunism and free-riding of the franchisees by identifying possible flaws in the system (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). This control mechanism can be administered at any stage of the channel system – from the selection criteria, the interview process of the potential franchisee to the contractual agreement and operational manuals used to dictate the day-to-day activities of channel members (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). The feed-forward control mechanismmay contribute to building an efficient distribution channel system, but how do franchisors track the compliance of each channel member in their franchise network?  Concurrent control mechanisms come into play when there is a need to ensure the conformity of channel members with the distribution system established by the franchisor (Simons, 1990). Concurrent control mechanisms are expressed in the form of checkpoints to monitor a channel member’s progress (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Simons, 1990). For instance, a car manufacturer may send a dealer representative on a monthly basis to check-in with the dealer principal if they have indeed committed to getting the latest showroom upgrade. Moreover, although the franchise contract between a car manufacturer and a dealer stipulates the latter is responsible for training new staff members at their expense, concurrent control mechanisms can still be exercised (Arruñada et al., 2001). For instance, the car manufacturer may send a dealer representative to audit the servicing department of the car dealership and ensure newly recruited staff are compliant with the franchisor’s servicing and warranty processes.  In rare cases, channel members may retain a form of control mechanism to exercise over their channel captain. This may be peculiar to franchising in which efficient knowledge transfer and information asymmetry represent important assets for the prosperity of the distribution system (Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011; Windsperger & Dant, 2006). In effect, if a franchisee retains crucial data from the franchisor, such as idiosyncrasies on the consumer and the local market within which he operates, the franchisee can exercise feedback control mechanisms (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Otley & Berry, 1980) This form of control mechanism can be used when the franchising contract is nearing completion, through withholding or sharing at varying levels of accuracy the information the franchisee retains (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). To reduce this exercise of control, franchisors, operating locally, must implement their highest contractual control mechanisms to increase the commitment and information sharing of channel members (Luo et al., 2011). However, franchisors operating internationally may be institutionally constrained in their ability to exercise contractual control mechanismsTherefore, a preventive action to reduce the feedback control mechanism of franchisees is to adopt careful recruiting processes of franchisees and invest in building franchising relationships based on trust and communication (Doherty & Alexander, 2006). Much like coercive sources of power and non-coercive sources of power in marketing channels, behavioural control mechanisms and outcome control mechanisms exercised by a franchisor may affect the levels of satisfaction and performance of the franchisee differently.  outcome controlmechanism is when the franchisor offers incentives to the franchisee in order to increase their willingness to achieve specific targets (Mellewigt et al., 2011). Because of the non-constraining nature of this form of control mechanism, the franchisee does not feel obligated to achieve a goal set by the franchisor. Instead, the franchisee is motivated to excel in their activities and gain the incentive. Therefore, outcome control mechanisms contribute to increasing franchisees’ satisfaction and performance levels (Bergen et al., 1992; Mellewigt et al., 2011). The positive effect of the outcome control mechanism is unique to franchising and cannot be generalised. In fact, Mellewigt et al. (2011) found conflicting results when investigating the effect of outcome control mechanisms on the employee–manager relationship. In this study, satisfaction levels decreased (Mellewigt et al., 2011).  The behaviour control mechanism is an elaborated form of contractual control mechanism. While the latter consists of‘you must do the task’, the behaviour control mechanism is ‘this is how you must do the task’. This form of control mechanism restrains the autonomy of the channel member subject to it considerably (Luo et al., 2011; Mellewigt et al., 2011). While the channel captain dictates the behaviours expected to achieve a similar quality standard of delivery and prevent the free-riding of opportunistic channel members, those with highly entrepreneurial needs will fail to see the benefit and may experience frustration from having to adopt the dictated routines. Therefore, their satisfaction may decrease, along with their motivation to perform (Mellewigt et al., 2011).  A number of tools have been implemented in recent years to allow channel captains more control over their marketing channel system. In fact, information system (IS) tools have been widely used in franchising to allow franchisors a degree of control over their franchise system. In a highly competitive market, IS tools have enabled franchisors to monitor the commercial activities of franchisees and ensure the desired level of compliance is achieved (Boulay, 2010). IS tools may also contribute to minimising any control exercised by the franchisees. For instance, if the franchisor has access to important data through the implementation of IS tools throughout the channel structure, it is expected that the levels of the feedback control mechanism will decrease (Boulay, 2010).  Researchers have strongly encouraged nurturing relational norms rather than administering procedures to control channel members. To address issues related to the exercise of control in marketing channels, promoting collaborative communication towards shared values and aligned interests contributes to a better acceptance of the received control by the franchisees. In fact, collaborative communication seems to decrease the need for control and achieve higher performance creating a healthy and profitable distribution system. In some cases, the channel captain who invests in collaborative communication rather than control mechanisms notices an increase in satisfaction and coordination among their channel members (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Mohr et al., 1996). There is certainly no perfect recipe to create a flawless yet profitable marketing channels, however implementing strong values rather than dictating procedures can effectively balance healthy and beneficial interaction between both channel parties. DISCUSSIONResearchers in the field of marketing channels have investigated sources of power and control in the franchise system and have shown that this vertically integrated system is conflictual by nature. In fact, research reveals that the main causes of franchising disputes are a result of control and power imbalances prevalent in the relationship between channel members, and are generally stronger on the side of the franchisor. Further, conflict in franchising relationships is inevitable and may result in positive outcomes, enabling parties to align their respective goals. In recent years, while the departure of car manufacturing impacted both the AAI and the country’s economy, other issues governing the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and their dealers have arisen and these issues have continued to be a concern in the Australian franchise sector. Undoubtedly, commercial arrangements between car manufacturers and their authorised dealers are raising important issues concerning the franchising relationship between both parties. Since the 2015 review of the Code, a market study conducted by the ACCC in 2017 reports that the relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer network is conflictual, noting that many challenges faced by dealers are a consequence of the use of power by car manufacturers. As such, unfair treatment of franchisees undermines not only dealers’ businesses but also the Australian consumers’ best interest (ACCC, 2017). The Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (DIIS) released a Regulation Impact Statement in December 2018 in which they discuss further the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer networks within the scope of the regulatory framework (DIIS, 2018). It is relevant to note that the Code has introduced, in its latest review, the good faith obligation to ensure that powerful franchise members behave reasonably when seeking a legitimate interest. In the DIIS report, the good faith of car manufacturers is seriously questioned. In fact, the DIIS believes that car manufacturers retain crucial information related to the operation of the franchise system and in choosing not to disclose this information, they may considerably affect the future of dealers’ operations.  This was further reinforced in the 2019 PJCCFS inquiry ‘Fairness in Franchising’. In fact, while the Code contains a number of provisions to request capital expenditure from a franchisee, none of these provisions considers the possibility of non-renewal (PJCCFS, 2008).  For instance, if the franchisee invests a considerable capital expenditure close to the end of the agreement, but the franchise contract is then not renewed by the car manufacturer. This is particularly alarming as dealers do not have any tenure attached to the capital expenditure, which they undertake at the request of the car manufacturer. Hence, dealers who are subject to non-renewal may be placed in an extremely vulnerable situation, especially considering that dispute resolution and litigation are expensive recourses for most dealers in this industry (PJCCFS, 2019). A long-standing contentious issue of the current franchising regulatory framework for the AAI is the allegation that dealers fear recrimination by franchisors when attempting to negotiate or resolve disputes legally (PJCCFS, 2019). Hence, in their attempt to search for fairer contractual terms and other franchising matters, dealers may be left powerless and at the mercy of overseas car manufacturers. Unquestionably, 2020 was quite eventful for the AAI. After 160 years in the Australian market, GM Holden withdrew, announcing the end of its car retail in Australia (Thomson, 2020). This sudden decision lit up a franchise dispute over the compensation package offered by Holden following the termination of its 200 Holden Australian dealers (Thomson, 2020). While the Detroit-based giant refused to negotiate fairer compensation terms requested by its franchised dealers and their advocate bodies, Honda and Mercedes-Benz both announced the transition from franchising to a new distribution model, the agency model (Jemeric, 2020) and Renault followed in January 2021 with its unilateral decision to outsource its retailing activities to an independent distributor (Gardini & Bryant, 2021).  The agency model consists of transitioning a dealer principal from a franchisee to an agent acting on behalf of the car manufacturer. The latter model enables the sale of products through any direct marketing channel (i.e. online sales) and via agents, who will receive a percentage of the profits. These profits are calculated based on the sales and customer satisfaction scores the agent has achieved. Honda estimates profits will be between 4 per cent and 7 per cent of the total sales (Dowling, 2020). The unique feature of this model is that new vehicles will now be sold at a fixed price, leaving no room for competitive advantages for the new agents. However, the operational costs will be reduced for dealers. This is largely due to the floorplan costs, including the stock of vehicles, initially bought and maintained at the franchisee’s costs, whichwill be owned by the franchisors. While this model may seem advantageous for dealers who are currently incurring millions of dollars in expenses, entrepreneurial freedom is at risk (Accenture, 2019). This strategic decision to move to an agency model has brought further franchise disputes as Honda terminated between 30 and 40 of its franchised dealerships – most of which were offered compensation lower than what they had lost (Tillett, 2020). Moreover, both Mercedes-Benz and Honda have been subject to serious allegations for intimidation during negotiation with their dealers along with other allegations regarding data ownership under the agency model and transparency of information to ensure the safe transition of dealers (Regulation of the Relationship between Car Manufacturers and Car Dealers in Australia (Formerly General Motors Holden Operations in Australia), 2020). The recent issues of franchising in the AAI highlighted a need to investigate the nature of the relational, legal and contractual franchising model within which car manufacturers and dealers operate. In fact, by the end of 2020, the Education and Employment References Committee extended the initial Senate inquiry into General Motors Holden Operations in Australia to one that covered the franchising relationship between all car manufacturers and car dealers operating in Australia. In this hearing, both sides of the franchise argument were heard. The Senate hearings included witnesses from four Australian car manufacturers and their industry association, three governmental organisations, four Australian new car dealers’ associations along with one dealer principal and the American-based National Automotive Dealers Association (NADA).  The inquiry has also attracted more than 20 confidential submissions from dealers, which the committee has considered as a strong indication of dealers fearing retaliation by their car manufacturer. The Senate hearing outlined further issues surrounding franchising and agency models in the automotive industry, with recurrent concerns as to whether stronger regulations will push other car manufacturers to leave the Australian market. An important concern followed by a recent exit of Renault as a player in the market  In brief, the literature reveals the complexities of franchising relationships in general and highlights some of the issues related to the franchising model in the AAI. To date, only limited research has investigated the role of the franchising regulatory environment in Australia and its impact on the franchising sector (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Lim & Frazer, 2002; Terry, 1996). None of these studies dives into the complexities of a particular retail industry – especially one that has proven to be highly conflictual.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH Marketing channels remain a captivating inter-organisational form, inviting researchers from various scholarships, including marketing, management, law and economics, particularly for franchising-related queries. In what follows, suggestions for future research in marketing channels are offered. Most of these focus on franchising and the agency model, the latter still unknown to the academic literature and providing further opportunities to delve into the model disrupting the standard of distribution forms. Economic theorists provide an in-depth understanding of franchising. First, resource-scarcity theorists have offered a thorough analysis of the motives of selecting franchising as a distribution model, including the risks when tangible and intangible assets are transferred. Second, property rights theorists further stress the need to protect intangible assets in franchising. Third, agency theorists have delved into the nature of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee and how the franchisor is called to monitor the relationship in order to maximise profits and minimise shirking and free riding costs. Fourth, upper-echelon theorists opened a debate surrounding the entrepreneurial characteristics of franchisees, and, more recently, stewardship theorists have offered a fresher perspective to the old principal–agent franchising relationship. Finally, institutional theorists have evoked the importance of the franchise system offered by two types of governance structures: the firm and the country’s regulatory framework.   Since the rapid growth of franchising across the globe, there is certainly an advantage to this distribution model, allowing corporations rapid expansion, both nationally and internationally. However, with the expansion of hospitality industries, including hotels and restaurants, research has focused on business format franchising, leaving only limited empirical findings on product and trade name franchising.This franchise typeis used only in the petroleum, automotive and beverage industries Today, there is an important call for a better understanding ofthis franchise model, how it operates in the automotive industry and what has triggered a move to the new model.   Currently, the disruption of retail in the automotive industry is rapidly evolving with the introduction of the agency model in New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and, most recently, Australia. This is a strong call for marketing academics and practitioners, including policymakers, to delve into the how, why and what of this transition. To do that, it will be important to understand what has happened in the automotive industry to date. Researchers may endeavour to approach this matter by considering:  How well understood is the social, legal and contractual franchising relationship between car manufacturers and dealers? What are the strategic difficulties leading to the end of product and trade name franchising through a transition to the agency modelWhat are the strategic differences between a franchise model, an agency model, and the outsourcing model (Renault)? What is the agency model? What does it have to offer as a new marketing channel? How does it benefit (or disadvantage) the consumer, the agent, and the car manufacturer?   How power, control, commitment, performance, and communication is perceived in the agency model? And in comparison, to franchising model and/ or company-owned channel (i.e. corporate channel)?  What are the motivating factors causing a transition to the agency model rather than a move to business format franchising in the same form administered in the fast-food industry or a hybrid between a buy-back of strategic dealerships (i.e. corporate channel) and business format franchisingWhat has become the nature of the legal and contractual relationship in the automotive industry under the agency modelWhat are the legal challenges for AAI regulators in terms of data transfer and ownership?  What theoretical constructs does the agency model offer to the franchising literature under managerial, economic, marketing, and legal lenses? Research in franchising issues has already offered great knowledge, with an emphasis on its strategic, economic and managerial importance. Admittedly, there is still much to learn and further opportunities exist to deepen the future academic work in this field of research. The research opportunities above are by no means an exhaustive list of the future of research in marketing channels in general and franchising in particular.  Turning to Australia as the disruption of the franchising model in the automotive industry continues simultaneously with the legal battle for better regulation in the AAI, practical research into the effect of marketing channels on relational, contractual, and legal aspects can provide greater benefit to all channel members and end-users. As sources of power, and control mechanisms have already received a lot of attention in marketing channel literature, there is little known on the exercise power and control in the AAI and much less on how it will transform as the agency model is settling in.   Undoubtedly, it will be important for all stakeholders in the industry (particularly new car dealers moving from their role of franchisees to agents) to understand the changes in their relationship not only with car manufacturers but also with their customers. It is believed that this new model will offer a better customer experience (Accenture, 2019). However, strong reserves have been expressed by new car dealers, their representants and public servants regarding the allocation of ownership in regard to customer data. Who own the customer data and/or should the customer data be considered part of the compensation package for dealers transitioning to the agency model or those being terminated in the process?  Certainly, the agency model offers higher sources of power and control to car manufacturers over their business model, the operation of their agents and therefore the customer experience. While communication between car manufacturers and agents will be essential for this transition to succeed, it often constitutes a coded reflection of the levels of power and control in inter-organisational relationships. Diving into the past, present, and future of the marketing channels in the automotive industry will offer a fresh understanding of the constructs of cooperation, conflict, dependence and satisfaction with a portfolio for stakeholders to improve relations, service, and regulations in the industry.  \n",

We argue that exchange between the franchisor and franchisee influences relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. The higher the franchisor and franchisee’s exchange of relational resources, the higher is the franchisee satisfaction, due to their mediating effect via higher relationship quality. Since economic transactions between the franchisor and franchisee are embedded in social exchange characterized by a certain level of trust, trust influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and hence satisfaction. Our findings based on franchisee data from the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) highlight that exchange positively influences franchisee satisfaction via higher relationship quality but trust negatively moderates the impact of exchange on relationship quality. In a high-trust situation, the effect of exchange on relationship quality is weaker because high embeddedness may inhibit the recognition of the importance of exchange for a high-quality franchise relationship. This study contributes to the social exchange theory perspective of franchise relationships by showing in addition to the previous literature that trust is not only beneficial for relationship quality but may also increase relationship blindness as hidden costs of trust. Therefore, from a managerial perspective, it is important to nurture business relationships by exchange of valued resources between the franchisor and franchisee before resting on the laurels of trust.Key words: franchising, leader-member exchange, social exchange theory, relationship quality, trust, franchisee satisfaction INTRODUCTION Satisfaction of personnel (employees and network partners) becomes an increasingly important issue in management. Franchising is not different in this sense but represents a specific setting. The nature of the specificity lies in the fact that franchisees take on multiple roles – customers, employees, investors, or business partners (Raha & Hajdini, 2020). Moreover, the relationship between franchisor and franchisee is characterized by asymmetry regarding control and mutuality (Davies, Lassar, Manolis, Prince & Winsor, 2011). Nevertheless, franchising is a highly interdependent relationship with both parties striving for and contributing to the profitability of their businesses (Elango & Fried, 1997; Harmon & Griffiths, 2008). Thus, the quality of the relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee is critical for the success of a franchise (McDonnell, Beatson & Huang, 2011; Watson & Johnson, 2010).  Relational characteristics such as satisfaction play a critical role in the franchisee’s willingness to continue the contractual relationship with the franchisor (Beatson, Lings & Gudergan, 2008; Jang & Park, 2019). Franchisee satisfaction is crucial in this regard because it is a predictor for the franchisee’s intention to remain in the contractual relationship and therefore influences the ongoing continuity of the franchise, especially when considering temporary contracts (Gauzente, 2003; McDonnell, Beatson & Huang, 2011; Morrison, 1997). Satisfaction is not only important for the intention to renew an existing contract, but also in terms of advocacy of the franchise system (Lee, Hsu & Huang, 2008). The overall importance of satisfaction is highlighted by its influence on franchise performance. Results from the Franchise Business Review 2018 (Coley, 2018) compare performance of top and bottom quartiles of franchises in terms of franchisee satisfaction. Top quartile franchises recorded 10-times higher unit growth, 40% higher collected royalties, 54% lower turnover of franchisees and their franchisees had 90% higher income. In the spotlight of the above, we see that franchisee satisfaction represents an important factor for the continuity and success of franchise systems. Franchisee satisfaction is strongly related to the quality of the relationship, which is not merely based on economic considerations but also on relational aspects. Exchange is the base for establishing and maintaining a relationship, it is a give (commitment) and take (support) as reciprocation of valued resources of the exchange partners, as outlined in social exchange theory (e.g. Gouldner, 1960; Eisenberger, Armeli, Rexwinkel, Lynch & Rhoades, 2001; Wilson, Sin & Colon , 2010; Foa & Foa, 2012) and applied in leader-member exchange (LMX) theory (Graen, Cashman & Dansereau, 1978; Erdogan & Bauer, 2015; Law-Penrose, Wilson & Taylor, 2015). Based on that, exchange influences the quality of a business relationship, but apart from (relational and economic) satisfaction, trust plays a critical role in the franchisee’s willingness to continue the contractual relationship (Beatson, Lings & Gudergan, 2008; Jang & Park, 2019). Especially trust affects the impact of exchange on relationship quality because it provides a frame of reference by embedding economic transactions in social relations (Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1997,1999), which is especially important in franchise business networks to reduce exchange hazards and to facilitate knowledge sharing and joint problem solving (Minarikova, Mumdziev, Griessmair & Windsperger, 2019). Consequently, the impact of exchange on relationship quality has to consider trust, which embeds the economic transactions between franchisor and franchisee in a larger relationship context.  This paper seeks to contribute to better understand the relationship between the franchise partners and highlights the importance of relational exchange and trust as a basis for relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. We argue that exchange between franchisor and franchisee is embedded in a certain level of trust, which influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. Specifically, our results highlight that trust as element of embeddedness negatively moderates the relationship between exchange and relationship quality. High-trust relationships do not nurture exchange of valued resources between the franchisor and franchisee because of creating a certain level of blindness about the importance of exchange for relationship quality and satisfaction. Hence, this study contributes to the social exchange theory perspective of franchise relationships by showing that, contrary to the previous literature (e.g. Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Gulati & Sythch, 2008; Altinay, Brookes, Madanoglu & Aktas 2014b), trust is not only beneficial for relationship quality but may also increase relationship blindness as hidden costs of trust (Selnes & Sallis, 2003). CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK & HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT While there is a great variety of theories in franchising research that explain the franchise relationship from a franchisor perspective (e.g., Blair & Lafontaine, 2005; Combs, Ketchen, Shook & Short, 2011; Dant, Grünhagen & Windsperger, 2011), less attention has been paid to the franchisor-franchisee relationship from the franchisee perspective (e.g., Grace & Weaven, 2011). One of the theories that sheds some light on this topic is the social exchange theory and its subsequent extensions (Altinay, Brookes, Yeung & Aktas 2014a; Altinay et al., 2014b; Chiou & Droge, 2015; Mignognac, Vandenberghe, Perrigot, El Akremi & Herrbach, 2015). Due to their focus on reciprocal exchange (Gouldner, 1960; Blau, 1964; Copranzano & Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell, Cropanzano & Quisenberry, 2012), social exchange theories acknowledge imperfect social structures such as unequal distribution of power, as present in franchise relationships (Davies, Lassar, Manolis, Prince & Winsor, 2011).  Although there are some similarities between social and economic exchange, Blau (1964) also asserted some differences. While economic exchange is characterized by contractual and therefore specified obligations, such as the franchisee paying royalty and initial fees while the franchisor provides the trade name and system know-how, social exchange do not have the same level of formality and is characterized by embeddedness involving a certain level of trust Andersen, Buch, & Kuvaas, 2020; Kuvaas, Buch, Dysvik, & Haerem, 2012).  Based on research results from social exchange and leader-member exchange (LMX) theory, in the following, we examine the relationship between exchange (franchisee commitment and franchisor support), relationship quality and trust on franchisee satisfaction. Figure 1 provides an overview of our theoretical framework. Exchange between the franchisor and franchisee influences relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. The higher the franchisor and franchisee’s exchange of relational resources through commitment and support, the higher is franchisee satisfaction, due to their mediating effect via higher relationship quality. Since exchange between the franchisor and franchisee is embedded in a certain level of trust, trust influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and hence satisfaction. Figure 1. Theoretical framework Leader-Member Exchange Theory As indicated by the importance the social exchange theory attributes to social ties and relational reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960; Blau 1964; Homans 1974), franchisor-franchisee relationships extend beyond contractual obligations and are characterized by relational exchange between both partners (Macneil, 1983; Dywer, Schurr & Oh, 1987). Both, franchisor and franchisee are bound by a relatively high level of interdependence in terms of their success (Hadfield, 1990). Comparable to other forms of social relations described by Blau (1964), we assert that franchise partners also “exchange advice, help [and] (...) support” (pp. 314-315). The franchisor-franchisee relationship is therefore assumed to represent a hybrid between social and economic exchange as described by Blau (1964) and Macneil (1980). Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX), which originates from Vertical Dyad Linkage theory (Dansereau, Grean & Haga, 1975; Liden & Grean, 1980), represents a theoretical framework that better fits the need for understanding and explaining the formation and development of such dyadic relationships. Erdogan and Bauer (2015) state that LMX theory focuses on relationships between interdependent leaders and members and can be described as “a relationship-based, dyadic theory of leadership” (p. 641). Originally used as a theory of effective leadership, it is also applicable to identify components and their interrelations that affect the franchisor-franchisee relationship (e.g., Aung & Ousawat, 2019; Huong, 2011). When it comes to building high-quality relationships, certain factors can be seen as particularly critical according to the theories of leader-member exchange (Breukelen, Schyns & Le Blanc, 2006). Specifically, LMX theory states that job relationships in which the individual nearly adheres to the requirements of the contract are worse than those in which the individual goes beyond the demands made in the contract (Liden & Graen, 1980). According to LMX theory, both job behavior and job attitude can be positively influenced by the exchange of both parties valued resources (Erdogan and Bauer, 2015, 641) – providing information and support on the part of the leader and increased engagement in challenging tasks on the part of the member. The quintessence of LMX theory is that work attitude and behavior is decisively influenced by both the leader and the member. This influence is exerted by providing relational resources, on the one hand by the leader by providing information and support and on the other hand by the member by getting involved through increased engagement and commitment (Liden et al., 1997). Although LMX is based on the concept of reciprocity of resources (Foe & Foe, 2012; Wilson et al. 2010; Law-Penrose et al., 2015), most LMX measures do not directly capture this very aspect of exchange. In many cases, the quality of the relationship between Leader and Member is measured instead (Liden, Sparrowe & Wayne, 1997; Liden, Wu, Cao, & Wayne, 2015). According to LMX theory, dyadic exchange processes can vary from high-to low-quality relationships (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015; Graen & Schiemann, 1978). In high-quality relationships valued resources are exchanged, such as development opportunities, support activities and mentoring. In return, members will be more motivated and demonstrate more loyalty and voluntary behavior towards their leader (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015).  Different studies found that subordinates’ behavior (whether merely fulfilling or exceeding contractual obligations) is associated with the quality of the relationship with their superior, increasing the subordinates’ performance (Settoon, Bennett & Liden, 1996; Erdogan & Bauer, 2015). The quality of their relationship is in turn linked to productivity and satisfaction (Huong, 2011; Scandura & Graen, 1984). Based on these explanations, it can be assumed that the exchange of relational resources such as advice, support (Blau, 1964) as well as loyalty and voluntary behavior (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015) contribute to establishing and maintaining a high-quality relationship. Contributing factors to relationships are “effort, material resources, information, and/ or emotional support exchanged between the two parties“ (Liden et al. 1997, p. 48). Such types of exchange between franchisor and franchisee form the basis for the development and maintenance of the relationship. The Impact of Exchange on Relationship Quality and Satisfaction A high-quality relationship between the franchisor and franchisee is characterized by reciprocal exchange of valued resources. The first element of exchange is the commitment of the franchisee to the relationship with the franchisor. Among other factors, commitment is important in contributing to overall relationship quality (Altinay & Brookes, 2012; Altinay, Brookes, Yeung & Aktas, 2014; Huong, 2011; Morgan & Hunt, 1994). Contrary to toxic relationships, which are based on coercion due to power, “healthy” relationships are characterized by the feeling of being voluntarily committed to the exchange partner (Morgan & Hunt, 1994). According to Morgan and Hunt (1994), commitment can be understood as the belief that the importance of a relationship justifies “maximum efforts” (p. 23) in order to maintain it. Commitment is essential to ensure its lasting effect by influencing attitudes and behaviors of both the franchisor and the franchisee (Harmon & Griffiths, 2008). The second element of exchange is the support of the franchisor to the franchisee, so that the franchisee can be successful. The commitment provided by the franchisee corresponds with matching support from the franchisor, forming a reciprocal exchange. Support provided by the franchisor through ongoing support activities (such as trainings, manuals etc.) is an important factor for creating a cooperative relationship and contributing to franchisee satisfaction (Davies et al., 2011; Morrison, 1996). The possible reason for this is hypothesized to be that support activities facilitate knowledge transfer to the franchisee (Minguela-Rata, Lopez-Sanchez & Rodriguez-Benavides, 2010). It can hence be seen as a “bridging mechanism” between exchange partners that helps establishing a high-quality relationship (Huong, 2011). As mentioned above, the franchise relationship is characterized by the dyadic exchange of valued resources (Mitchell et al., 2012; Erdogan & Bauer, 2015) and can thus be understood as an interdependent relational process. While support activities can mainly be attributed to the franchisor, the franchisee responds with increased commitment in this exchange process. This means commitment is adjusted accordingly. Therefore, exchange from the franchisee’s perspective represents the relational give (franchisee’s commitment) and take (franchisor’s support) as reciprocal resource contributions of the franchise partners (Gouldner, 1960; Eisenberger et al., 2001). This in turn influences the relationship between both franchise partners and its quality, as it is built through exchange (Dansereau, Graen & Haga, 1975). Thus, we postulate the following hypothesis (see Figure 1).  The impact of exchange on franchisee satisfaction is mediated by relationship quality. Exchange, Relationship Quality and the Moderating Role of Trust Based on the principle of reciprocity, people conduct social exchanges in order to receive something of value in return. By exchanging favors or other acts and receiving rewards on both sides, the parties involved form a social bond between them which evolves to a social relation (Harmon & Griffiths, 2008; Liden, Sparrowe & Wayne, 1997). The stability of this relation is directly influenced by the exchange partner’s support and commitment as resource contributions. However, since there is no guarantee for receiving reciprocal contributions of relational resources, social exchange requires trust.Based on the perceived level of openness and support provided by the franchisor, embeddedness through trust (Granovetter, 1985) acts as reinforcing effect to align interests of both parties and helps improving relationship quality by creating a nourishing environment (Davies, et al. 2011; Liu, Luo & Liu, 2009). This applies to franchise relationships which are a form of dyadic exchange (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015) where both business partner’s give and take is especially crucial at the onset of the relationship. Developing through actions of both parties, franchisor-franchisee relationship is characterized by trust generated through social exchange as well as by the interdependence between the parties.  Thus, trust is an important building block in social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) which has been applied as one of the core components in empirical research using the theory (Lambe, Wittman and Spekman, 2001). Specifically, trust has been defined as a willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence (Moorman, Zaltman & Deshpande, 1992, p. 315). By this definition, trust as element of embeddedness (Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1999) – temporarily – substitutes exchange of valued resources (such as franchisor support through knowledge sharing and franchisee commitment), or better to say, compensates for momentary deficiencies in the exchange. Consequently, since exchange between the franchisor and franchisee is embedded in trust, it influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. In low-trust contexts, the effect of exchange of valued resources on relationship quality is pronounced. In this low-embeddedness setting, the relationship between the partners depends on the dyadic exchange (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015). From the beginning the relationship between franchisee and franchisor quickly evolves away from discrete, small-risk transactions to continuous, high-risk and high-stake transactions typical for franchise setting (which is further pronounced by the need to establish franchisee’s business at the start). For this reason, gradual build-up of the relationship, which is assumed in the social exchange theory (Lambe, Wittman and Spekman, 2001), is not possible. Furthermore, a low level of trust means by its definition (Moorman, Zaltman & Deshpande, 1992) a low level of willingness to rely on the partner – in this setting, high-quality relationship thus requires a constant reciprocal exchange to keep uncertainty at bay. In contrast, in high-trust contexts, the role of exchange becomes less important for a high-quality relationship as the franchisee is willing to rely on the franchisor (Moorman, Zaltman & Deshpande, 1992). In this high embeddedness situation, exchange moves to the background and its effect on relationship quality is weaker. Furthermore, in this high-trust setting, high embeddedness (Uzzi, 1997) may endanger the exchange of relational resources by creating a certain level of blindness inhibiting the recognition of the importance of exchange for relationship quality (McEvily et al., 2003). We, therefore, formulate the following hypothesis (see Figure 1):  Trust negatively moderates the effect of Exchange on Relationship Quality. METHODOLOGY Data Collection & Sample The data were collected in two rounds in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). First, between April 2018 and March 2019 and in a second between March 2019 and May 2019 through both online and printed versions of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was accompanied with a cover letter promising that information will be aggregated and treated anonymously. The target group for the questionnaire were respondents who own and manageat least one franchise outlet. For this reason, we excluded answers by outlet managers. The response rate for the questionnaire was 8%. The final sample consisted of 105 observations. The outlets are doing business in fitness (27%), education services (26%) and gastronomy (19%). Measurement The scales were adopted or adapted from existing literature and exhibited good internal consistency (see Table 1 for the descriptive statistics of the variables). The dependent variable, franchisee satisfaction, is measured by six items from Chiou et al. (2004). While exchange has been operationalized by various dimensions in previous LMX research (e.g., Gottfredson, Wright, Heaphy, 2020; Gooty, Servan, Thomas, Gavin & Yammarino, 2012), the most important aspect is exchange of relational resources through commitment and support (Wilson et al. 2010, Foa and Foe 2012 and Law-Penrose et al. 2015). Based on the conceptualizations by Kumar, Hibbard and Stern (1994), Bishop, Scott, Goldsby and Cropanzano (2005) and Erdogan and Bauer (2015), we measure Exchange with support and commitment by using items representing franchisor support and items for representing franchisee commitment. The moderator variable, Trust (three items), is adapted from Wu (2015) and the mediator variable, Relationship Quality, is adapted as well (Jap, Manolis and Weitz, 1999; Weaven, Baker and Dant, 2017). Finally, two control variables have been included: Financial performance is measured by five items from Chiou and Droge (2015) and Delgado-García, Rodríguez-Escudero & Martín-Cruz (2015). These five items were compared to two performance benchmarks (in line with Cyert & March, 1963) – own historical and performance of peers, in this case other shops in the area. Finally, we asked franchisees for the year when they started their business. The correlation matrix (Table A.1) as well as the item list (Table A.2) are presented in the Appendix. Table 1. Descriptive Statistics Variable Mean (Standard Deviation) Exchange (6 items, α = 0.76) 4.00 (0.66) Trust (3 items, α = 0.86) 3.82 (1.03) Relationship Quality (7 items, α = 0.96) 3.86 (1.03) Franchisee Satisfaction (6 items, α = 0.94) 4.02 (1.07) Financial Performance (10 items, α = 0.93) 3.39 (0.77) Business Age 10.11 (6.84) Results We specified and estimated a moderated mediation model in PROCESS (Hayes 2018) to test the hypotheses, see Table 2 for the individual regression results. During the analysis structural multicollinearity (VIF > 10) was detected, likely due to model specification (interaction term) in the regression on relationship quality. As a remedy, we used the mean-centered variables in the regression models and as a result variance inflation factors remained at low levels (VIF < 3), indicating no issues of multicollinearity. The testing of the moderated mediation was conducted in one step but is presented in two parts to follow the order of the hypotheses. We tested the hypotheses by examining 1) the effect of exchange on franchisee satisfaction mediated by relationship quality (H1), and 2) the moderation of the effect of exchange by trust on relationship quality (H2).

The results revealed that the mediation of exchange by relationship quality on franchisee satisfaction was significant at three selected levels of the moderator because the bootstrapped confidence interval does not include zero, see Table 3, providing support for H1.

Regarding the moderation of exchange by trust on relationship quality, we can see in Table 2 that the moderation (Trust*Exchange) is negative and significant at p < 0.01, providing support for H2. This means that the effect of exchange on relationship quality becomes attenuated as trust increases which is also indicated by the decrease of the indirect effect as the level of trust increases (see Table 3). In addition, the index of moderated mediation (Hayes 2015) provides further support for the two hypotheses, because the bootstrapped 95% CI of the index does not include zero; index = - 0.112 [- 0.229; - 0.030]. Thus, we find support for a moderated mediation (H1 and H2) of exchange by trust via relationship quality on satisfaction. The key effects of the model are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Overview of Effects. Note: *** p < 0.001; * p < 0.05; 95% Confidence intervals (CI) are displayed in squared brackets.  As follow-up, we probed the moderation with the Johnson-Neyman technique in PROCESS to check the moderation effect on a more fine-grained level. We did not find any significant transition points within the range of the moderator even upon inspection of more values between the selected percentiles; the moderator was significant over the whole value range (p < 0.05). In order to visualize the moderation effect, we used a pick-a-point approach, and plotted the results in Figure 3. Figure 3.

It should be noted that the benefit of trust is reduced, as exchange of relational resources increases. The probing of the interaction showed that even for high levels of exchange, trust is beneficial, but the impact of exchange on relationship quality is reduced. An increase in exchange is most beneficial when levels of trust are low, which is most likely the case when a business relationship has just started. Increasing contributions of relational resources provides a viable tool to improve relationship quality quickly, whereas trust might need more time to be built up. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Franchisee satisfaction is a key factor that marks successful franchises (Coley, 2018). Further, when we acknowledge that franchisee satisfaction influences the decision to remain in the franchise system (Beatson, Lings & Gudergan, 2008; Jang & Park, 2019), dissatisfied franchisees are harmful for both parties of the franchise relationship. The importance of this topic is pronounced by the fact that the turnover rate in franchise systems is around 10% (e.g., Franchising USA, 2017; Tuunanen & Torikka, 2008). Relationship quality is then in turn important for the franchisee satisfaction (e.g., Morrison, 1996). Our research sheds further light on the complex nature of linkages between these factors, supporting a moderated mediation of exchange by trust via relationship quality on franchisee satisfaction. We found that trust is not only beneficial for relationship quality (as in, e.g., Morgan & Hunt, 1994) but its role is even more pronounced in low exchange settings. Unfortunately, the benefits of trust cannot be reaped immediately as trust has to be built-up gradually in the franchise relationship (e.g., Davies et al., 2011). In order to understand what happens on a basic social exchange level and in terms of relational development in a franchise context, we applied social exchange and LMX theory to franchise systems and tried to capture the give-and-take of social ties beyond basic economic considerations (Blau, 1964) which would then affect relationship quality. Exchange from both sides of the relationship can have a strong impact on relationship quality without necessitating ingrained trust which needs to be built-up over time (this can be extended from our findings because we controlled for age of the business relationship in the model). As a result, exchange can substitute in the absence of trust. This can be conceptualized in the following way: Familiarity with another party can be built by frequent committed exchange of relational resources and can therefore substitute and establish mutual commitment. This result is complementary to previous research, where relational exchanges are likely to lead to higher trust in the long term because familiarity with the other party breeds trust (Macneil, 1983; Gulati & Sytch, 2008; Altinay et al. 2014b). We also add to previous literature that has discussed the importance of social aspects in franchise relationships (e.g., Huong, 2011) by illustrating the importance of exchange on relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. Moreover, the results also reveal that when trust is established, there might be less incentive for relational exchange to improve relationship quality because the marginal value of investing in a higher-trust relationship diminishes (the slope becomes flatter as trust levels increase, see Figure 3). Thus, this might show that high-trust relationships are more easily maintained once a certain level of trust is reached but, in this high embeddedness setting, it may increase the risk and appeal of opportunistic behavior (Selnes & Sallis, 2003). Hence, from a utility maximizing viewpoint, the incentive to increase commitment or support decreases as trust is built-up. Research has explored the “dark side of trust” in various business relationships and discussed the destructive impact of high trust on relationship outcomes (Anderson & Jap, 2005; Skinner, Dietz & Weib, 2013). This highlights the relevance and implications of such behavior in dyadic business relationships on a more general level than only in franchise networks. 4.1 Managerial Implications In this empirical study of franchise systems, we illustrated that relationship quality driven by exchange is highly relevant in keeping franchisees satisfied. Thus, exchange can make or break a business and is crucial for the success and survival of the business relationship which is especially fragile in the beginning of its establishment. Especially at this stage our findings provide insights, namely that an increased level of exchange profit relationship quality over-proportionally when trust levels are low. Therefore, a focus on meaningful and supportive exchange of relational resources is especially advised in the beginning of the relationship to improve relationship quality instantly and potentially gain additional trust effects in the long-term.  As trust increases the marginal impact of exchange on satisfaction decreases. This means that an investment in exchange of relational resources useful for the franchisee in terms of know-how are most beneficial when trust is low, so likely when the business relationship between franchisee and franchisor has been recently established. Subsequently, when trust has been solidified, a reduction in exchange is likely to optimize the trade-off between associated costs and impact on satisfaction. This can be exploited as an opportunistic efficiency gain as further investments for a high-quality relationship can be reduced while maintaining the same relationship quality level, allowing resources to be focused elsewhere. We see that financial incentives or performance are not sufficient to sustain high franchisee satisfaction, especially when a less favorable economic environment pushes down financial performance. This indicates that engaging in exchange is a form of relationship investment that pays off with higher relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction, which is beneficial for both parties. Further, exchanges lead to the build-up of trust. While high trust could be exploited, it also presents a cushion against deficiencies in exchange. In a high trust setting, the impact of problems in the exchange are largely substituted by trust, as evident from our research, at least in the short term. This is very important under uncertain or unstable conditions. We suggest that franchise parties should consider exchange of relational resources as a continuous investment in the relationship although the incremental improvement of relationship quality diminishes with increased levels of trust. When such a positive approach toward the relationship has been established it will profit both parties, increasing franchisee satisfaction, performance and reducing their turnover (Coley, 2018). 4.2 Limitations and Future ResearchOur findings are limited by the fact that we studied the topic only from the perspective of the franchisee. While we bring forward a number of reasons why franchisee satisfaction is important for the franchise success, franchisor’s perspective would be informative especially in the terms of boundaries of the relationship. Complementarily, future studies could explore the perspective of the franchisor or combine both perspectives of franchisor and franchisee on relational exchange to obtain a comprehensive view and perceptual differences of this subject. Further, we only used perceptual measures of exchange as indicated by the franchisee, assuming that this represents the interdependent exchange between franchisor and franchisee. We would argue that this a rather safe assumption because reciprocity in such business relationships, meaning exchange, trust, and relationship quality will be reflected similarly in the perception of both parties. In addition, we are considering franchisee satisfaction, so it is meaningful to approach exchange from this perspective. Naturally, undetected opportunistic behavior on either side (no real reciprocity) is a possibility but over time would be identified and sanctioned, meaning such an imbalance would only be a temporary state. Therefore, we consider this to be negligible for our sample and findings. Further, as this study applied a cross-sectional design, long-term effects can only be extrapolated with due caution. Future research could look through longitudinal studies at how exchange, trust, relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction evolve over time. This would shed more light on the dynamic nature of these factors in franchise relationships. 5. CONCLUSIONS In our research, we explored the relational side of the franchise satisfaction by applying social exchange and LMX theory. Our empirical results provide support for moderated mediation of exchange by trust via relationship quality on franchisee satisfaction. This has various implications for both research and practice, as it shows how exchange enhances relationship quality that induces franchisee satisfaction. We also show that trust presents an important component in the relationship that creates not only benefits for both parties in the franchise relationship. However, in high embeddedness context, high trust may result in strategic blindness of the franchise partners not recognizing the importance of exchange for relationship quality. Therefore, from a managerial perspective, it is important to nurture business relationships by exchange of valued resources between the franchisor and franchisee before resting on the laurels of trust.\n",
      "Knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising network: Antecedents and performance outcomesMiona Pajić  PhD student Faculty of Business, Economics and Statistics University of Vienna Vienna, Austria, 1090 Telephone: +4367761633187 Email: coccinella.pajic@gmail.com Univ.-Prof. Dr. Josef Windsperger Professor of Organization and Management Department of Business Decisions and Analytics Faculty of Business, Economics and Statistics University of Vienna Vienna, Austria, 1090 Presented at the 34thAnnual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School May 24-26, 2021 Knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising network: Antecedents and performance outcomesAbstract This study investigates the antecedents and performance outcomes of knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising networks. The knowledge management field remains important in the era of constant learning. By applying the knowledge-based theory and the relational governance view, this paper provides new insights into the factors that influence the choice of different information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms. The results suggest that the franchisor has to choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness, to support the transfer of the tacit knowledge and improve performance in the franchising networks. In addition, the transfer of explicit knowledge will be facilitated by mechanisms with low information richness, which will enable better performance.  Keywords: Information richness, Knowledge transfer, Knowledge transfer mechanisms, Franchising, Performance Introduction Knowledge is one of the key factors for gaining a competitive advantage (Argote and Ingram 2000). As previous research indicates, knowledge transfer plays important role in achieving success in intra- and interorganizational networks (Maskell and Malmberg 1999; Paswan and Wittmann 2009; Minguela-Rata et al. 2010). The efficiency of knowledge transfer depends on many factors, including willingness and capability to transfer it (Kogut and Zander, 1993). Knowledge is characterized by different factors, such as tacitness, trust and communication openness, which influence the choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms. The knowledge is \"created and organized by the very flow of information\" (Nonaka 1994, p.15). The transfer of knowledge is present when some organization is affected by the experience of another organization (Argote and Ingram 2000). In this research, the study focuses on the determinants and performance outcome of knowledge transfer mechanisms in the franchising networks. Specifically, we examine, based on the franchisor's perspective, the effect of knowledge transfer mechanisms on franchisor performance. In the theoretical framework, the transfer of knowledge is explained by applying the knowledge-based view (e.g. Kogut and Zander, 1993; Nonaka 1994; Srećković and Windsperger, 2011). In addition to the knowledge-based view, this research uses the relational governance view (Dyer and Singh 1998) to develop the theoretical framework. According to the knowledge-based view, the organization is a system that enables the creation and transfer of more tacit knowledge (Nonaka 1994; Grant 1996). This paper, based on the knowledge-based view, argues that different levels of knowledge tacitness influence the choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms.  It also provides understanding of the impact of trust and communication on knowledge transfer mechanisms by using the relational governance relational view. In this way, the paper provides an extended view of antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms.  LITERATURE REVIEW  In recent years, researchers have investigated a variety of approaches to knowledge transfer. This is expected because the role of knowledge itself has a major impact on the firm’s competitive advantage. As knowledge implies know-how, brand name, and everything that belongs to specific-assets of a franchisor, thus making the transfer of those knowledge assets highly important for business (Iddy and Alon 2019). Levine and Prietula (2012) argue that knowledge transfer does not improve performance outcomes in every case. Tacit knowledge management requires an understanding of the more complex background, including learning within organizations and through societal institutions (Lam 2000). Also, an important aspect is the sharing of tacit knowledge (Lam 2000). Many studies researched the absorptive capacity, addressing particularly the extent to which the recipient is prepared to receive knowledge from a sender (e.g. Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Easterby-Smith et al. 2008). Transfer of tacit knowledge is influenced by trust and forehand involvement (Foos et al. 2006). In the franchise system, a franchisor needs to delegate knowledge to franchisees in the appropriate manner. Understanding and applying the system know-how at the local market is crucial. The intangible (tacit) system knowledge is difficult to transfer (Teece 1985). It requires more effort in a way of \"teaching, demonstration and participation\" (Teece 1985, p.229). More precise insight into the process and content of knowledge transfer is needed (Foos et al. 2006).  Besides, an appropriate transfer mechanism should be applied (Jasimuddin 2007). As Ramadhan et al. (2017) argue, the difference regarding the formality of mechanisms should be also taken into account. This research aims to investigate performance outcomes from the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms with different information richness. Table 1 presents the examples of the research papers with different approaches in this field.

The research is focused on \"the generative mechanisms\" for the transfer of scientific knowledge (2021, p.1). Arnett et al. 2021 It addresses a sample of 215 salespeople. Focus is on the tacit knowledge transferred between sales and marketing professionals.   The authors state that the quality of communication and mutual understanding are important factors in the transfer. Current research shows a focus on knowledge transfer efficiency, as well as, knowledge transfer performance. A large number of papers put attention to the transfer of tacit knowledge and absorptive capability. Also, some research addresses motivation for knowledge transfer in the firm setting and human behavior regarding knowledge sharing. The research gap, that this study tried to address, is reflected in the relationship between different information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms and franchise performance, by taking into account the tacitness level of the knowledge. In addition, this paper combines the knowledge-based theory and the relational governance view. In this sense, it examines the role of trust and communication for the choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms with different degrees of information richness.Theoretical background Since this research is based on the knowledge-based theory, this section provides an explanation of the knowledge characteristics and the concept of information richness of knowledge transfer mechanisms. Further, based on the relational governance view, antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms (trust and communication openness) are presented.The research aim is based on the following theoretical framework (see Figure 1). Figure 1: Theoretical framework Knowledge-Basedtheory- Knowledge attributes(Codifiability,Complexity)Relational Governance View- Trust- CommunicationKnowledge transfer mechanismsPerformanceKnowledge attributes The vast majority of scientific papers use categories of tacit and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is defined as the asset derived from a system of a company (Calantone, Cavusgil and Zhao 2002). Therefore, it is hard to transfer (Kogut and Zander1993). On the contrary, explicit knowledge can be codified and transferred through written materials (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995).  To explain the impact of knowledge attributes on the choice of knowledge transfer mechanism in this study, the degree of knowledge tacitness is used. This variable is operationalized through codifiability and complexity.This approach is derived from Winter (1987), Kogut and Zander (1993), Zander and Kogut (1995). Codifiability provides information on the extent to which is possible to encode knowledge and define it through written materials. It is much easier to share knowledge by using manuals, rules or other written media. Complexity is defined “as the number of critical and interacting elements embraced by an entity or activity” (Kogut and Zander 1993, p.633). It is highly connected with tacitness because tacit knowledge is viewed as more complex. Codifiability and complexity are used according to Teece (1985) and Winter (1987). To get closer to the meaning of knowledge transfer mechanism as a communication medium, it is important to present the information richness theory. This concept is discussed in more detail in the next section. Information richness concept Information richness theory plays an important role in many studies that focus on characteristics of knowledge. Daft and Lengel (1984) created the concept of information richness. This theory analyzes which is the most suitable mechanism or medium of communication. Different degrees of ambiguity requires different mechanisms (Daft et al. 1987). Sheer and Chen (2004) stress that the balance between requirements of information processing and adequate medium is inevitable for the appropriate transfer. The medium has a high degree of information richness under personal communication. For instance, face-to-face interaction is the richest mechanism for communication. It enables direct and immediate feedback. On contrary, different written documents (like data, reports) do not allow instant feedback. Thus, their information richness is low. According to Simon (1957), organizations are social systems, dedicated to the efficient processing of information. In this case, the information primarily relates to explicit knowledge, which is mainly transferred by low information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the knowledge-based view explains organization as the system that enables the creation and transfer of more tacit knowledge (Nonaka 1994; Grant 1996), whereby its transfer requires a more high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanism.  Knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising In the last decade, knowledge transfer problems attracted significant attention. The authors addressed knowledge transfer mechanisms by using various constructs. For instance, Chen et al. (2014) use replication and adaptation, to explain mechanisms of transfer. Replication means to replicate the partner's business model. The adaptation refers to the extent of how much one partner combines and modifies practices of the other partner.  Liyanage et al. (2009) refer to modes of knowledge transfer that are used in the relation between source and receiver. Windsperger and Gorovaia (2011) investigate the relationship between knowledge attributes and transfer mechanisms.They adapt measurement according to Daft and Lengel (1984) and Vickery et al. (2004).  In this research, we use a broader range of transfer mechanisms. A lot of studies focus on training, as the mechanism with high information richness. The new technologies provide more communication possibilities, which makes transfer easier. This implies communication through different electronic media, like emails, messages (SMS), and different chat applications. Changes in technology creation, regarding new applications, occur rapidly. To capture the construct of knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness, this study uses face-to-face, telephone calls, and instant messages. In this way, we addressed mechanisms that enable fast response (Vickery et al. 2004). The construct of knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness includes email and different written and numeric material. This group differs from the previous one because those mechanisms disable visual effects and fast response (Vickery et al. 2004). This study investigates the relationship between the knowledge attributes and mechanisms of knowledge transfer in franchising networks. The franchising context implies that the franchisor transfers a business concept to the franchisee(s). While the franchisor guides the main business model, a franchisee can operate an independent business. The training plays a key role in efficient knowledge transfer (Welch, Benito, and Petersen 2018). Thus, franchisees need to easily approach and learn new knowledge, to apply it successfully.  Franchisors, according to the contract, transfer tacit and explicit knowledge to franchisees (Windsperger and Dant 2006; Ghantous and Das 2018). Explicit knowledge, transferred to franchisees, should be understandable enough to be codified in handbooks (Perrigot et al. 2017). Based on previous research results, we expect that tacit knowledge will require a transfer mechanism with a higher degree of information richness. On the other hand, the explicit knowledge will be transferred by using mechanisms with a lower degree of information richness. Hence, we derive the following hypotheses: H1a: The more explicit franchisor's knowledge is positively related to the knowledge transfer mechanisms with a lower degree of information richness. H1b: The more tacit franchisor's knowledge is positively related to the knowledge transfer mechanisms with a higher degree of information richness. Trust and knowledge transfer mechanisms Many studies confirm that trust plays an important role. Knowledge, especially the one specific to the company, requires the reliability of all actors. Trust exists when partners believe and are confident in the positive actions of other partners (Anderson and Narus 1990; Morgan and Hunt 1994). To share knowledge, even within companies, trustful cooperation is required. Currall and Judge (1995) emphasize that accuracy of shared information and knowledge could decrease in the process of collaboration without trust. The process of inter-organizational knowledge sharing increases when supported by trust (Sahay 2003). As Gulati (1995) and Yu et al. (2006) state, trust reduces relational risk. Further, it decreases the hazards of knowledge transfer (1995, 2006). In this situation, there is a higher probability that under the higher level of trust, a franchisor will use transfer mechanisms with a lower level of information richness (Lo and Lie 2008). Conversely, the lack of trust would eventually lead to the use of mechanisms with a higher level of information richness. According to the theoretical background, the hypotheses are as follows: H2a: When trust increases, the use of high information richness knowledge transfer mechanisms decreases. H2b: When trust increases, the use of low information richness knowledge transfer mechanisms increases. Communication openness and knowledge transfer mechanisms Communication plays a key role in various business contexts. To reach recipients, knowledge has to be appropriately communicated. This makes transfer easier and more successful. Some earlier works suggest that communication openness, supported with control and organization support, improves entrepreneurial behavior (e.g. Guth and Ginsberg 1990). As KaleSingh, and Perlmutter (2000) argue, open communication in a franchising context improves information exchange between parties to achieve the common goals. As a result, this leads to satisfaction into the business relationship (Grace et al. 2013). Forming a team with an opportunity to communicate will improve knowledge sharing (Ming-Chang et al. 2013). Hence, the extent of communication influences the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms and the success of knowledge transfer (Daft and Lengel 1986; Williams 2007; Maalouf et al. 2020).  H3a: Communication openness is positively related to knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness. H3b: Communication openness is positively related to knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness. Knowledge transfer mechanisms and franchise performance Many studies show the positive performance effect of the knowledge transfer. For instance, Dhanaraj et al. (2004) state that there is a positive impact of explicit knowledge on performance in international joint ventures. Wu (2016) uses knowledge transfer as a mediator between formal contracts and performance and shows that effect is supported. De Luca and Cano Rubio (2019) argue that efficient transfer leads to competitive advantage. To measure the extent of transfer efficiency, they use the knowledge amount and velocity of the process. Minguela-Rata et al. (2010, p.396) use three transfer mechanisms: \"training, manuals, and services of support\" and investigate their impact on performance. In Table 2, we present some examples from previous research examples.  Table 2: Research studies examples Author  Year Results Slaughter and Kirsch  2006  They state that adjusted type and frequency of the mechanisms improve the performance of the recipient (field study in an IS department). Minguela-Rata et al.  2009  The impact of knowledge complexity on performance in a franchise system; results support positive relation.  Guzman and Trivelato  2008  The socio-technical approach is better support for codified knowledge transfer than the top-down approach (empirical evidence from a Steelworks plant)  Minguela-Rata et al.  2010  Knowledge mechanisms and performance relationship. As a result, support services have the greatest impact on performance. Moon et al.  2021  They examine franchisors’ capabilities and willingness for knowledge transfer and show that franchisees’ willingness acquire knowledge improves franchisees’ performance. We derive the following hypotheses: H4a: Knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness are positively related to performance. H4b: Knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness are positively related to performance. The conceptual model depicts the relationship between knowledge transfer mechanisms with high and low information richness and performance outcomes, as well as, the antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms.  Figure 2: Conceptual model Empirical analysis To undertake this research, a survey is employed. The collected data include 1245 franchise systems. Those systems cover next countries: Germany (577 franchise systems), Austria (374), Czech Republic (165), and Slovakia (129). Finally, 168 observations are used in the analysis.  This study uses partial least square (PLS) analysis in statistical program WARP PLS version 7.0. CB-SEM (covariance-based SEM) does not allow testing of formative constructs due to identification problems (Sarstedt et al. 2016). This is the main reason for applying PLS-SEM (PLS structural equations modelling). PLS-SEM gives the possibility to capture both formative and reflective constructs, which is enabled by the use of the least-squares estimation procedure (Podsakoff et al. 2006).  The conceptual model includes three dependent variables, six independent variables, and two control variables, as noted in the following sections. The two dependent variables are knowledge transfer mechanisms and performance.  For knowledge transfer mechanisms, two variables are used separately, namely, these are knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness (Model 1) and knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness (Model 2). Those measures are built according to Daft and Lengel (1984), Vickery et al. (2004), and Gorovaia and Windsperger (2010). Knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness (KTMH) is a formative construct that includes the following mechanisms: face-to-face (training, meetings, visits), telephone calls, and instant message (mobile, chat applications, etc.). Knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness (KTML) are measured as a formative construct, with the following mechanisms: emails, written formal (documents, manuals), and numeric formal (accounting data). Formative measures are used according to the theoretical reasons (Diamantopoulos 2006). The constructs are created, respecting the rules for indicator retention, like indicator weights and VIF (each indicator's tolerance) values (Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer 2001;Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2006). The question regarding measure is: \"To what extent do you use the following knowledge transfer mechanisms to communicate with your franchisees?“  Performance measure, used as a reflective construct, has a theoretical background in scientific works of Gorovaia and Windsperger (2013) and Kale and Singh (2007). The construct of performance (PERF) includes the following items:system growth; the increase of revenues and more profitability. The question is: “To what extent did you achieve the following performance criteria in the last year?” Independent variables (reflective constructs), used in the research, are as follows: TRUST: Trust measure with the theoretical background from Blomqvist, Sundqvist, & Seppänen (2007). COD: knowledge attributes - codifiability (Gorovaia and Windsperger (2010)) COMPLEX: knowledge attributes- complexity (Gorovaia and Windsperger (2010)) COMM: communication openness (KaleSingh, and Perlmutter (2000); Grace et al.(2013)) All items and constructs are presented in Appendix. The control variables include the age of the franchise system and the size of the franchise. Age (AGE) presents the number of years since opening the first franchise outlet. Size (SIZE) presents the sum of company-owned and franchise outlets.

Model 1 depicts the positive effect of complexity, trust, and communication openness on knowledge transfer mechanisms, thus supporting hypotheses H1b and H3a. Model 2 in Table 4 present the antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness. The results present the positive and significant impact of codifiability, trust, and communication openness. Thus, hypotheses H1a, H2b, and H3b. Next we analyse the performance impact of knowledge transfer mechanisms by applying PLS models.  Model 1 tests the relationship between knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness (KTMH) and performance. Model 2 tests the relationship between knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness (KTML) and performance.

The results from Table 5 show that knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness positively influence performance. Thus, hypothesis H4a is supported.  Concerning antecedents of high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms, the results show positive and significant effects of trust and communication openness. Hypothesis H3a is supported. Indicators of model fit show an acceptable level (AVIF and AFVIF are acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3).   According to the theory, we expect that the more tacit franchisor´s knowledge will require the use of high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms.  In addition, open communication builds trust and improves knowledge transfer. The result referring to the significant effect of trust in Model 1 could provide a new future research question. It can be explained by the overall positive information-exchange effect of trust that improves knowledge transfer regardless of the mechanisms that are used. In both groups of knowledge transfer mechanisms, trust plays an important role. Finally, there is a significant coefficient of the size and age of the franchise system. The results in Table 6 (Model 2) provide a significant coefficient of knowledge transfer mechanisms on performance. This result could imply that when the franchisor facilitates the transfer of the explicit knowledge by using low information-rich mechanisms it makes a significant effect on the franchise performance. The results of Model 2 show a significant impact of codifiability, trust, communication openness, size, and age. The hypotheses H1a, H2b, and H3b are supported. Model fit indicators show acceptable levels (AVIF and AFVIF are acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3). Theoretically, the franchisor will choose low information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms to transfer more explicit knowledge.  Contribution and Implications  In this paper, we developed a model that tests the antecedents and impact of knowledge transfer mechanisms on performance in franchising networks by applying the knowledge-based view (Kogut and Zander 1993; Nonaka 1994; Grant 1996) and relational governance view (Dyer and Singh 1998).  This research extends the franchise literature on the influence of knowledge attributes (knowledge-based view), trust, and communication openness (relational governance view) on knowledge transfer mechanisms with different degrees of information richness. Specifically, it extends the knowledge management research by focusing on the performance implications of knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising networks.This paper also has practical implications in franchising. Franchisors have to choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with adequate levels of information richness, to improve performance. Thereby the main drive of choosing the knowledge transfer mechanism is the degree of knowledge tacitness. As the findings of the regression analysis show, the franchisor will choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness to enable the transfer of more tacit knowledge. On contrary, in the case of more explicit knowledge the franchisors choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with lower information richness. Furthermore, the PLS results indicate that knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness have a significant impact on performance in the franchising networks, which is also confirmed in the case of low information-rich mechanisms. This can be explained by the fact that both tacit and explicit knowledge have a strong impact on performance. This finding is a reminder of the role that knowledge transfer mechanisms have. Therefore, it suggests that the decision regarding the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms with different information richness should be made carefully, to improve the franchise performance outcome.  Limitations and future researchThis study has several limitations. The first limitation is in the range of knowledge that is conceptualized in this empirical research. Since no franchisee knowledge data were available, we could only focus on the impact of the franchisor knowledge attributes on the choice of knowledge transfer mechanism. Future studies could include also the knowledge of franchisees. A further limitation is associated with the construct of trust. Knowledge-based trust is one important dimension, but the other one is general trust (Lazzarini et al. 2008). If the franchisor has a high level of general trust, this might reduce the use of high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms and increase the use of low information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms.

      "Internationalization Challenges for Saudi Arabian Fast-Food Franchises:  The Case of Kudu Bassem M. Nasri Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship and International Business Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University Half Moon Bay, Al-Khobar 31952, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia bnasri@pmu.edu.sa Pablo Collazzo Yelpo Professor of Socioeconomics Grenoble Ecole de Management 12, rue Pierre Sémard, F - 38000 Grenoble, France pablo.collazzo@grenoble-em.com Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School UNSW Business School May 24-26, 2021 Internationalization Challenges for Saudi Arabian Fast-Food Franchises:  The Case of Kudu Abstract The purpose of this research is to answer the question “How do local Saudi Arabian fast-food franchises grow into international chains, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization”. Franchising in Saudi Arabia is barely addressed in literature, despite the presence and the prominence of local franchise brands, many of which successfully expanded inside and across borders. The country is the biggest market of the Middle East. While changes and reforms brought by the 2016’s national transformation and Vision 2030 are moving Saudi Arabia quickly towards a diversified, oil-alternative economy, the country is still largely under-researched, especially with regards to franchising. If at all done, literature mostly portrays it as an importer of foreign franchises, and overlooks the development and the international growth of local franchise chains, and the factors which might encourage or hinder this growth. A qualitative, single-case, case study methodology is hereby applied to explore Kudu, a major Saudi-Arabian-born fast food service franchise chain, which was acquired in 2015 by an American investment group. The research finds that an appropriate regional legal infrastructure, and the international competitiveness of authentic, local franchise concepts, stand in favor of internationalization of Saudi franchises, while a local environment dominated by global franchise brands, and early exit decisions, might delay or hinder the process. The research has implications for local franchisors and policy makers, and recommendations for future research in this area considerably overlooked in literature.   Key Words: Franchising, Fast Food, Saudi Arabia, Internationalization Introduction Choosing the right entry mode for international expansion is a critical managerial decision and can have significant and far-reaching consequences for a firm‘s performance and survival (Shahkat Ali and Ahamat, 2018; Lu and Beamish, 2001; Bradley and Gannon, 2000). The internationalization of business in the fast-food industry is mostly done through franchising (Alnassar, 2017). While home-grown franchises have existed for more than 30 years in the Middle East (Alharbi 2014) Middle Eastern franchises across global markets have barely received attention in the literature (Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh, 2020). Saudi Arabia, the geographic context of this research, is one of the world’s top economies, and has been able to surpass many of its developing counterparts in the past half-century with respect to economic development (United Nations Development Programme, 2002). It has recently captured the interest of the world for political as well as economic reasons (Nasri and Collazzo, 2016; Welsh and Raven, 2006), and has recently acquired special further importance and attention with the recent changes which accompanied the Vision 2030, and the national transformation plan of 2016 into an economy less dependent on oil,  which incorporated major changes to the economic structure of the country (Blazquez et al, 2018; Balzquez et al, 2017; Gardner, 2017; Vision 2030, 2016). Despite these facts, the country has been so far quite under-researched at multiple levels, especially in terms of the development and the international expansion of local fast-food franchises. The purpose of this research is to mind these gaps in literature by addressing the question of how local Saudi Arabian fast-food franchises grow into international chains, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization.Review of Literature Franchising is one of the oldest forms of cooperative activities (Financial Times, 2005; Michael, 2000) and the traditional model which continues to provide products and services at a mass scale to millions of consumers worldwide (Anwar, 2011). While franchising is well-entrenched in the retail trade, Franchising has been traditionally linked to food service (Lewandowska 2014), which account for a significant share of franchise businesses, so that 40 of the top 100 global franchises in 2019 are food service related (Top100 Global Franchises Report 2019).  Researchers report that franchising has become a popular way for domestic and international expansion of firms (Rosado-Serrano & Paul, 2018), a competitive business strategy for successful expansion (Banderas et al, 2013), today’s ultimate primary means of foreign market exploitation (Petersen & Welsh, 2000), and a route for SME business expansion around the world (Keating, 1989; Sanghavi, 1998; Sadi and Henderson, 2011). Among three alternative popular methods by which businesses expand their market and distribution channels (IFA Website, Beshel, 2010), “Franchising” is the ultimate primary means of foreign market exploitation (Petersen & Welsh, 2000), the other two being “Licensing” and “Distributorship” (IFA Website, Beshel, 2010). International franchising literatures have focused on investigating why domestic firms engage in international franchising, with major reasons suggested being resource constraints, lack of foreign knowledge, and limited growth prospects (Rosado-Serrano et al, 2018). Domestic franchise market saturation was emphasized as one of the major “push” factors for international retail franchising in United States, Canada, and parts of Western Europe (Swartz, 1994; Martin, 1999; Preble & Hoffman, 2006; Alon, 2007; Olotu, 2011), where the saturation meant here is that made by a crowded market of home-grown franchisors, as opposed to saturation of the market by local franchisees of international franchise brands, as is the case with the Middle Eastern market, especially the Saudi Arabian, subject of this research.  A primary “pull” reason for internationalization of local franchises is the approach by potential franchise partners at international markets is (Welch, 1989; Doherty, 2007; Swartz, 1994, Alon, 2004; Preble & Hoffman, 2006; Olotu, 2011, Nasri and Collazzo, 2018). Other pull reasons were suggested by Hoffmann et al (2016), who examined how a country's institutional environment affects the international expansion activities of U.S. franchise companies, and suggest that favourable political governance and country's business climate of entry regulations, taxes, and communications infrastructure, are all important predictors of foreign franchise firms' expansion into that country. Their research addresses the factors prevalent in host countries, where it would be interesting to explore if and how local market, business conditions, and legal infrastructures could play a role in internationalizing local franchises.  Franchising in the Middle East is generally described in terms of foreign franchises with minimal information of local, home-grown franchises, where foreign franchises are given credit for the emergence and success of local retail food franchises in the region (Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh, 2020). The Middle East is generally recognized by Westerners as an oil-rich region, but few have a deeper understanding of the market opportunities in this region (Abbasi and Hollman, 1993; Raven & Welsh, 2004). Saudi Arabia, context of this research, is one of the top twenty economies in the world, and the largest economy in the Arab world and the Middle East, which saw fastest growth of non-oil economy, especially in 2019 (Wikipedia / Economy of Saudi Arabia, 2020). International interest keeps growing further ever since the announcement of Vision 2030’s strategic plan in 2016, which incorporated major changes to the economic structure of the country (Vision 2030, 2016; Blazquez et al, 2017), and aimed to modernize the Saudi society, and bring it more into line with the most recent world developments (Ibnmhana, 2018; Gardner, 2017; Vision 2030, 2016). With this major transformation and economic diversification, franchising emerges as a major contributor to local development in the country, where the international expansion of Middle Eastern franchises are starting to partially reverse the direction of capital flows, and lead to more revenue generation coming back into the country. Nevertheless, rarely do researchers address the internationalization of Saudi Arabian franchises (Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh, 2020), the circumstances, the successes, and the challenges associated with them, and mostly portray the country as an importer of global franchise brands, where the successes of these brands is mostly the concern of the majority of existing literature.  Research Propositions While attempting to answer the basic research question ““How do local Saudi Arabian fast-food franchises grow into international chains, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization”, literature was almost missing relevant literature.  Despite the presence known of local franchises - though very limited in number – barely did literature acknowledge the presence of franchises which were established, developed, and expanded out of Saudi Arabia. Research did refer to the fact that a few Middle Eastern franchises were competitive at international markets, especially those which reflect authentic cultures, in the case of which, however, Saudi Arabia was not addressed, except as a receptor of incoming franchise brands. Alharbi (2014) diagnosed a range of factors which face development of franchising in Saudi Arabia, where her concern was the general franchising atmosphere, including the perspective of franchisees for foreign brands, and not the birth or the internationalization of local franchise businesses. (Sadi and Hendersen, 2011) and Sadi et al (2011) referred to a few local Saudi Arabian food franchise names, not elaborating about how these local names were established or developed, and whether and how local conditions or business infrastructures supported their growth. The research by Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh (2020) was found to be the only one which studied the emergence and the competitiveness of Middle Eastern franchises at international markets, and suggested that the reflection of local cultures by Middle Eastern franchises was a competitive advantage in international markets. While cases from UAE and Lebanon were subject of their study, it would be interesting to know what process they followed, and what local and regional market conditions and/or legal systems prevailed, which enabled them to cross their home countries. Local chains of home-grown franchises did exist in Saudi Arabia, and a few attracted the attention of international investors, but they were hardly mentioned in academic research. We propose: P1-Local and regional business and legal environments contribute to internationalization of Saudi Arabian franchises.  P2- A local franchise market dominated by franchisees of global franchise chains suppresses readiness for international growth by Saudi Arabian franchisors. P3- Opportunities represented by the differentiation of indigenous, local Saudi Arabian franchises contribute to their early exit to international investors at local or regional expansion level.  Methodology 4.1.An Exploratory, Qualitative, Single Case Study Research Considering the research question “How do local Saudi Arabian franchises grow outside their home country, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization” leads the researcher to follow an Exploratory Qualitative Research Methodology, as “how” questions are likely to lead to the use of case studies, histories and experiments as the preferred research method. The case study research method is “empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” (Yin 2009, p.3).  It should be mentioned that the ‘how’ question in exploratory research issues does not mean that an experiment is required to establish a direct cause and effect link between A and B (Perry et al, 1998; Perry, 2001). However, as the exploratory type of case study is used to explore those situations in which the intervention being evaluated has no clear, single set of outcomes (Baxter & Jack, 2008), the use of this methodology is justified and appropriate for the subject topic in hand.  Given the exploratory nature of the research, and provided that the researcher is addressing the study’s question in the geographic context of Saudi Arabia, which has been found to be subject of a major gap in the literature body, the research has been decided to be run on one of its most prominent fast food chains. The choice to select this case was made based on availability of local chains which crossed the Saudi Arabian border, and the incident of acquisition by the American investment group, which attracted much of the business and the franchise community interest then. One rationale for selecting a single-case rather than a multiple-case design is that the single case represents the critical test of a significant theory (Yin, 2004). A second rationale is in clinical psychology, in which a specific injury or disorder may be so rare that any single case is worth documenting and analyzing. The injury occurs so rarely that scientists have been unable to establish any common patterns (Yin, 1970, 1978). In such circumstances, the single-case study is an appropriate research. A third rationale for a single case is the representative or typical case. Here, the objective is to capture the circumstances and conditions of an everyday or commonplace situation. In these instances, researcher’s observations insights into the problem would form a significant case study because few social scientists had previously had the opportunity to investigate these problems, even though the problems were common across the country, as distinguished from the rare or unique case (Yin, 2004; Liebow, 1967).  In order to meet the quality standards required in qualitative research, trustworthiness had to be established by meeting its criteria defined by Lincoln and Guba (1985) being each of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Credibility, the equivalent of construct validity in quantitative research (Krostjens and Moser, 2018), has been ensured by meeting multiple strategies used for the purpose, as recommended by Lincoln and Gaba (1985). One of these strategies is the process of the triangulation of data sources. Triangulation provides multiple measures of the same phenomenon (Yin 2009, p. 116-117), and it has been well achieved, whereby interviews, used as a primary data source, were supported by documentation, archival records, physical artifacts, and direct observations (Baxter & Jack, 2008, p.554) all being secondary data sources. Interviews with the chain’s founders and top executives were conducted, using an interview guide of questions in order to further investigate their responses (McNamara,1999; Valenzuela & Shrivasta, 2002). The research followed certain set of questions derived from a case study protocol” (Merton, Fiske & Kendall, 1990; Yin, 2009, p.107). Following Yin (2003, p.45), the case study protocol will comprise an overview of the case study objectives included in a message to request the interview from prospective interviewees; field procedures; case study questions (interview guide); and a guide for the case study report. Interviews will be guided conversations rather than structured queries, meaning that the actual stream of questions in a case study interview is likely to be fluid rather than rigid, despite the  consistent line of inquiry which the researcher follows (H.J Rubin & Rubin, 1995; Yin, 2009, p.106).  Interviewed for the sake of the case study were the company’s founding executives, the company’s ex-chairman and CEO , and the company’s ex-COO. In due course, the interview guide’s set of questions was outlined in a way to address the basic research question, and to try to gather valid relevant information around the research’s propositions. 4.2.Case Description: KUDU Kudu was established in April 16, 1988 in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, which is also home of the company’s corporate head office.  It is one of 4 other restaurant concepts which is owned by a 3000-employee group holding. Kudu is a Saudi-based open kitchen concept fast food restaurant chain that serves burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches and breakfast meals.”  (www.tenyellowpages.com). With over 300 branches spread throughout the Middle East, Kudu grew to become the leading brand name in fast food, exceeding both local and international franchisees. The company also owns Aal-Khafeef, another local Arabian pizza (Manoushehconcept, with a few dozen outlets open, and is franchisee of two Lebanese restaurant chains, with several outlets and an ambitious expansion plan. The company has been featured in Forbes magazine, as one of the most recognized Middle Eastern brands, the ‘Best Sandwich’ by a leading local daily English Newspaper, and ‘The Best Food Corporation’ by the Municipality of Dubai.  The CEO has been awarded the ‘Best CEO in Saudi Arabia’ for retail and restaurants multiple times. In February 2015, private equity firms Abraaj and TPG Capital have signed a deal to purchase a majority stake in Kudu, sources aware of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The deal was then first in the region for TPG, which manages about $65 billion of capital according to its website (www.tpg.com, 2015; www.reuters.com, 2015).  Data Analysis and Discussion 5.1.Findings around Proposition (1) P1-Building a local and regional business and legal environment contributes to internationalization of Saudi Arabian franchises.  Franchising Law & IP protection For the Saudi Arabian franchisor, venturing beyond the region came with challenges. Notably, the lack of a reliable regulatory framework leaves franchises vulnerable when it comes to the legal and intellectual protection of intangibles. Conversely, foreign jurisdictions provide ample coverage on franchising, so global players have the upper hand on shielding their resources, including intangibles. Kudu took good note of the weakness of the franchise legal infrastructure and international franchise affiliations in the region, and realized that this has put Saudi Franchise businesses at legal risk when expanding abroad by franchising. The CEO disclosed that some local entrepreneurs choose to register their brands in the USA, UK or France, and come back home as a foreign brand, so as to enjoy better regulatory protection. It was only in November 2019 that a Royal decree supported the issuance of the Franchising Law which regulates, acknowledges, and protects local Saudi Arabian franchises from their inception up to growth to expansion, and governs the enforcement of all types of franchise agreements. The law covers the protection, licencing, and registration of trademarks offered as part of the franchise agreements, all of which were governed by the laws of trade agencies.  EMCs  and Regional Franchise Treaties  Despite the fact that Kudu existed in a time when the needed local legal environment did not exist up to the hoped level, Kudu was able to expand to more than 250 branches, in Saudi Arabia and in 5 other neighbouring countries. Company executives admitted during the time of the research having had difficulties supporting their neighbouring regional franchisees in Bahrain and Kuwait from their central kitchen in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. An example of the challenges was allowing fresh food ingredients and packaging material to cross the regional borders, when the number of franchised outlets at the host market would be too small to justify investing in a new central kitchen. They suggest that regional and international free trade treaties and agreements cover inter-country common regulations which would facilitate cross-border franchise operations. A proper legal infrastructure, backed by the support of officials and policy makers, would strengthen the regional expansion of franchise brands, and grant them further exposure to international markets. “The Saudi Export Development Authority is doing a great job in promoting and supporting the export of local products, and I see this service covering the showcasing of local Saudi franchise brands and matching them with potential franchise partners across international markets.”, says an executive of the firm.  5.2.Findings around Proposition (2) P2- A local franchise market dominated by franchisees of global franchise chains suppresses readiness for international growth by Saudi Arabian franchisors Scarcity of Precedents  Company executives admit having had to create by themselves the knowledge of regional and international growth, and to pay for any mistakes from their own pockets, when the general practice and the less risky formula was to be a franchisee for a reputed global franchise which already comes from a success history. While Kudu and many Saudi born franchises succeeded in expanding to tens and hundreds of branches inside and outside of the country, the challenge imposed by the scarcity of precedents of Saudi franchisors, and the dominance and the long history of successful global franchise chains was high enough to be sometimes “frustrating and discouraging”. Kudu and their peers of local franchisors were themselves their own benchmark.Bargaining Power of Local Franchisees Prominent brands are very selective in their choice of partners. Accordingly, Kudu executives admit that “they have the upper hand in this game”. Their partners were master franchise groups who had the wealth, power, and resources to control best market locations, expand faster, market their products, partner with best suppliers, and attract a higher number of sub-franchisees, and they are well-liked by the local consumer. “Foreign Franchises are much respected here: they enjoy a presence in the local customer’s mind, and Kudu learnt a lot from them. The Middle Eastern consumer has always been impressed by foreign brands, choosing them over local ones”, says the ex-CEO. 5.3.Findings around Proposition (3) P3- Opportunities represented by the differentiation of authentic, indigenous, local Saudi Arabian franchises contribute to their early exit to international investors at local or regional expansion level.  Local billionaires – international owners The way to win the competition with global franchisees was to look for their gaps and mind them, and “we were among those who were able to differentiate by many aspects, including freshness, local touch, variety of options, and the reflection of the Saudi culture in tastes, if and where possible”. This differentiation enabled Kudu to expand, gain regional and international prominence, and attract the attention of both, master franchisee groups and international investors. Choice for them was either to keep on fighting and growing, to expand either by inviting partners or by going public, or to exit. Kudu scaled its franchising network at a remarkable pace, yet it soon became apparent that a better balance between home growth and international expansion was needed. At that point, going public emerged as a tentative way forward. However, the founding team was hesitant to give in to the increased disclosure that comes with an IPO. “We certainly wanted to avoid the challenges of fragmented ownership, dilution, and related side-effects that would jeopardize its controlling stake. And if we were to give up control, we wanted to secure a premium price an IPO can simply not guarantee”. The choice was made with a buyout proposal hard to turn down, and the deal was eventually reached, leaving the founding team with a minority “cash-cow” stake in the company, and an international new ownership of a Saudi-made franchise. Implications, Limitations and Future Research This exploratory qualitative case study calls for more attention to the local franchises grown in the Middle East in general and opens the door to explore and analyze options available for local franchises in the geographic context of the Middle East’s leading and fast-growing market, Saudi Arabia. The study stands out in a literature about the region, which, if and where available, mostly neglects the presence, the development, and the conditions around the internationalization of prominent Saudi franchise chains. The research addressed a name that represented an interesting, attractive investment opportunity for global players, and is seen by the international brands available in the Saudi market as serious competitors, like many other local franchises in the country subject of this studied. The Kudu exit transaction leaves some questions unanswered, particularly whether exiting when at the verge of global success is a wise choice for promising businesses from emerging markets. Recent evidence suggests the answer is likely ‘yes’, as Kudu’s choice was replicated in the high-profile buyouts of local online retailer Souk.com by Amazon, and ride-hailing Careem by Uber. While the decision to exit the business to a generous, tempting international buyer who could render founders quickly early billionaires, a bit of a patience, backed by local public and private support to preserve the local Saudi identity of home-grown brands, would have ended up in a global, Saudi-made and Saudi-owned brand, should the owners decide otherwise to turn the exit down, keep expanding across international markets, and enjoy the proceeds of international franchise partners. A support by local authorities and policy makers could have also, in the worst case, restrict or promote the exit of local franchises to local investors, rather than international ones, who would see a current generous offer still less costly than it would have been in the future, as the promising Saudi chain is still at its early, emerging, growth stage. While being a single case adds a challenge, yet the case was alone justified, rigorous and worth exploring, in addition to the fact that it has no similar case to compare across. It is hoped that this research will inspire future researchers to take the study to further empirical levels - especially when more cases will have come more abundant and available for study - and to check for applicability of the suggested propositions to other geographic Middle Eastern and international contexts.  \n",

The authors contributed equally. Is Further Better? What the gravity model tells us about franchising in BrazilAbstract While the gravity model was designed by researchers in retailing, few studies have used it in the wide empirical literature on franchising. Yet, it is a very relevant analytical framework (its theoretical version) and an efficient econometric tool (with the econometric version of the gravity equation) to study the determinants of flows within the space: trade flows, knowledge flows. For these reasons, it is very appropriate to study franchising, business-format franchising being based on the transmission of a business concept and methods i.e business knowledge. In this article, we study the franchise flows in Brazil, providing interesting results based on a unique new dataset.  Key words: Franchise Flows, Franchise unit spatial allocation, Brazil. This version: March 2021 Is Further Better? What the gravity model tells us about franchising in Brazil Introduction Over the years, several authors have used gravity and spatial models to explain different kind of flows between the regions, such as population, trade or patents (representing regional knowledge). In retailing literature gravity and spatial-interaction models has been often used, to explain location strategic choices. Thus, using a spatial-interaction model Gripsruda and Benito (2005) try to explain foreign market choice concerning human choice behavior. The authors provide evidence that the choice of destination is based on experience of the form and its own internationalization strategies rather than distance and market attractiveness.  Gravity model, on the other hand, from the first conceptualization of Tinbergen (1962), uses newton expression for mass explain that trade between two regions (attraction) is proportional to their size (economic power) and inversely proportional to their distance. This model, designed by academic research on retailing (see Cliquet and Sabroonchi, 2009), has also been used to empirically analyze trade between countries. According to LeSage and Thomas-Agnan (2015) a gravity model describes how the magnitude of the flows between two regions is determined by the size of the regions and the distances between them. Usually, the researchers use many characteristics of origin and destiny regions in the models. Regarding to franchising location choices, Bitti et al. (2020) based on location choices and spatial competition literature in retailing, provide evidence that the choice for agglomeration, and the location in areas with a high population and a high human development index, lead to higher chain performance in Brazil. However, the authors do not use a gravity model to study the attraction of some city of Brazil, like Sao Paulo. In this context, for the best of our knowledge no literature has explained the franchised-units allocation choice between the cities using gravity models, particularly from those in Brazil. Therefore, our purpose is to use gravity model to explain strategic geographical choices taken by the franchisor. Several recent articles highlight the relevance of studying Brazilian franchising, e.g. Grünhagen et al. (2020), Bitti et al. (2020), Lanchimba et al. (2021), Fadairo et al. (2020), Nunes et al. (2019). This article proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the hypotheses, in the framework of the theories of gravity models. Section 3 describes the data and the study variables; we use data collected from the franchise sector in Brazil. Empirical specifications using gravity model are provided in section 4. Concluding comments are offered in section 5. Theory and hypotheses Gravity models are derived from the laws of Newtonian physics. The laws of Newtonian physics are the study of massive objects. This law establish that all objects attract each other with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of distance that separates its centers.   In economics literature gravity models has been mostly used for predicting trade flows. These models try to explain attractiveness phenomena and spatial interactions.More specifically, in retailing literature Reilly (1931), Huff (1964) and Huff & Batsell (1977) are pioneers in this field. In fact, Reilly established the law of retail gravitation states, in which consumers made a trade-off between the cost of travel to a retail outlet and the attractiveness of alternative shopping opportunities.In this context, gravity models underline the importance of geographical distance. However, the authors demonstrate that the attractiveness of a retailing location, and therefore the choice to turn up in a specific location place, is not exclusively related to it. Thus, these models include other factors in the attraction concept. Then, in addition to distance related to the potential of a reginal area of local, gravity models consider other attributes as demographic weight, gross domestic product, or socioeconomic characteristics.  According to Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) the gravity model equation for N countries can be written as:    (1) Where,  is the monetary value of exports from i to j, is the word GPD, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑌 are the GDP of the countries i and j respectively,   is the cost in j of importing a good from 𝜎> 1 is the elasticity of substitution, represent exporter and importer ease of market access or country i’s outward and country j’s inward multilateral resistance terms. Based on gravity models is suggested that there are differences in location quality (Ehrmann & Meiseberg 2011; Ghosh & McLa erty 1982; Lee & McCracken 1982; Craig et al., 1984; Ghosh & McLaferty, 1987; Jones & Simmons, 1990; Simons 1992; Kelly et al., 1993; Peterson 2003; Christensen & Drejer, 2005; Park & Khan, 2006; Khan 1999; Park & Khan 2006). This literature recognizes that some location places are more profitable, or even that those places have a greater potential to be lucrative, than others. In franchising literature, Ehrmann & Meiseberg (2011) find that, location decisions of expanding franchising networks, are affected by exogenous location factors that is market perspective criteria as population density or local income, in addition with endogenous network characteristics. Hypothesis 1 (The greater the economic potential of a city, the more attractive it is for franchise flows. Hypothesis 2 ( The more distant a city, the less attractive it is for franchise flows. Data and measurement We use three distinct sources of data in our empirical analysis. The first one is the ABF's official Franchise Guide, which is an annual publication dedicated to people interested in franchise sector. This publication makes available data concerning chains' characteristics as franchise fees, total number of outlets, investment required from potential franchisees, number of employees, and so on.  Our data is for 2011, 2014 and 2016.  The second source of information was the websites of the franchise chains in our sample. We collected Zip code information from the cities occupied by the chains, as well as whether the outlets operate in some kind of shopping mall. Data collection occurred in two distinct periods: from April to July 2011 and from August to December 2014. Because of the different moment of collection between ABF yearbook and the manual capturing of website data, it is natural to notice some discrepancies. We pooled the sources of information and matched the data in order to stabilize the final dataset, and get all information necessary for our empirical analysis. Finally, we obtained a sample of 335 franchise networks. These networks occupy 1,397 Brazilian municipalities and are present in 26 states. Our third source of information is the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). We collected information about georeferencing of the occupied municipalities (longitude and latitude), GDP, population, area and the Human Development Index (HDI). We collected information from censuses undertaken by IBGE in 2000 and 2010. Municipalities HDI data are also available in the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) website for the years 2000 and 2010.  Our unique sample consists of a six-year panel, in a wide range of activities, and contains geographical information. The aforementioned bias regarding some specific segments calls for the use of sector dummies in the econometrical estimations in order to control it. 3.1.Measurement We here present the study variables used in the empirical estimations 3.1.1. Dependent variable Franchise flow: is the number of franchised units from city i to city j 3.1.2.

Empirical Strategy and Results 4.1.Methodology The econometric model (gravity equation) is expressed as follows:  𝑙𝑛𝑌 𝑙𝑛𝑌 𝑙𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑛𝑀 𝑙𝑛𝑁Where,  is the number of franchised units from i to j, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑌 are the GDP of the countries i and j respectively,   is the distance between the cities (common border), represent exporter and importer socio characteristics: unemployment and population. LeSage and Thomas-Agnan (2015) use OLS to illustrate an example of gravity model with data of census in France. For this reason, we perform OLS estimations taking into account different combinations of variables to ensure the robustness of our results. In those equations, we test for heteroscedasticity using the White's method, for multicolinearity with the variance inflation factors. However, this kind of model can raise endogeneity problems between franchised flow and GDP.We check for potential problems of endogeneity, using the instrumental variables method.  may indeed raise endogeneity problems, because they are franchised flow deriving from the attractiveness of the city (). We compare aa regular OLS model, with an instrumental model in two stages, including instruments. We consider as instrument the lack of the variable. The results show that this is good instrument, since it satisfices two conditions: it has an explanatory power with respect to the suspected endogenous variable, and it does not influence directly the outcome variable. The overidentifying test (Hansen's J: 0.115, p-value: 0.735) show that the model is overidentifying. However, we find evidence that there is a problem of endogeneity test for 2014 (χ2: 150.84, p-value: 0.00) as well as 2016  (χ2: 28.86, p-value: 0.00). 4.2.Results Our estimation results are presented in Table 3.

Second, the higher the GDP growth of the city, the more it is attractive in terms of franchise flows, which provides evidence for the first gravity hypothesis (H). Consistent with this result, we find evidence that the highest the growth rate of a town, the lowest the outgoing franchise flows.  Yet, the second gravity equation (H) does not find evidence here. Indeed, franchise flows are not larger when the transmitting and receiving cities share a border. On the contrary, our results highlight that franchise flows in Brazil are distant from the chain headquarters. Finally, our estimations on the Sao Paulo subsample underline a very specific feature of franchise flows in this State. \n",

A third possibility in terms of this contractual mix is addressed in the present study: the multi-unit franchisees (MUF), franchisees that operate two or more units in the same chain. The literature on this issue has, almost unanimously, indicated benefits arising from the presence of MUF but, at the same time, informs too little concerning this phenomenon in emerging markets. Our study triangulates different aspects to develop and test a theoretical model related to franchisors' option for the more intense use of multi-unit franchises than traditional franchises (single-unit franchisees) or company-owned units. We applied econometric procedures to a sample with 202 networks (year-base 2018). Three theoretical aspects support a set of hypotheses regarding the characteristics that motivate a more intense MUF adoption by the networks. Specifically, the model examines the effect of agency costs, contractility of intangible assets (property rights), and local transaction costs on the proportion of MUF stores. In the applied procedure, the effects of the operationalized variables on the proportions of SUF stores and own stores are also verified, which allows comparability between the results found. These results indicate that the concentration of stores in contiguous markets, the uniformity, and the importance of maintaining the network's value proposition is associated with a greater proportion of MUF stores. It is expected to contribute to the literature on governance and control of franchise networks by addressing a phenomenon that is not so new but is still little known in structuring these networks. Key words: multi-unit franchises, agency theory, property rights, asset specificity, governance of franchised networks. INTRODUCTION Recently, a particular topic has attracted attention in the franchising literature: multi-unit franchises (MUFs). In this type of arrangement, a single franchisee can operate more than one unit, sometimes reaching hundreds of units. According to Boulay, Caemmerer, Evanschitzky and Duniach (2016), about 40% of franchisees in the USA's 50 largest chains are MUFs. In short, multi-unit franchise arrangements represent a widespread and dominant pattern of structuring franchise networks in many sectors (Dant, Weaven, Baker, & Jeon, 2013). For decades, MUFs have been avoided in the literature despite being an old practice, as indicated in studies like Zeller, Achabal and Brown (1980). One explanation the difficulty in accessing data related to this kind of franchising arrangement (Bradach, 1995). However, Garg and Rasheed (2003), in a provocative statement, proposed that the status of multi-unit franchisees as an \"anomaly,\" a term used by Kaufmann and Dant (1996) to describe MUFs, seemed to be more attributable to the lack of a focused and comprehensive theoretical attempt to explain the phenomenon than due to any inadequacy of agency theory - one of the most traditional approaches to the examination of franchising. The success of this arrangement calls into question some traditional theoretical predictions. For example, agency theory proposes that franchisees tend to have a higher level of effort and dedication to their outlets than salaried employees, since ownership enhances incentives to effort. However, as more units in the chain are assigned to the same franchisee, there is a need for her/him to hire employees to manage the units, so that problems related to incentives tend to occur. But the MUF phenomenon in franchise chains worldwide suggests there are benefits derived from their use (Bodey, Weaven & Grace, 2011). Such benefits should outweigh any agency costs related to problems with incentives. The literature indicates that MUFs represent more abundant sources of funds than traditional single-unit franchisees (SUFs). These resources can be material ones, such as the capital invested in various units and the local infrastructure needed to manage them (Hussain & Windsperger, 2010, 2013), but they can also be of an intangible tacit nature, such as the level of knowledge, no longer restricted to a single location, but to the region. Besides this, to the extent that these franchisees manage a business with several units, they are motivated to follow the operational standards of the brand, focusing on more strategic aspects of the business, which strongly contributes to aspects of consistency and preservation of the brand value (Hussain, Sreckovic, & Windsperger, 2018). There are also indications that by spreading investments in more units, franchisees’ risks are diluted and better allocated, reducing the expected return that could not be realized, and achieving fairer margins from a single unit (Dant et al., 2013). Among the gaps still present in knowledge regarding MUFs, one particularly motivates the present study: little is known about this type of franchising in emerging markets (one exception is Lima, 2019). Given the greater contractual complexity, we expect that possible institutional weaknesses and political-economic instability will make this type of environment different from the markets generally explored by the literature. This means gaps in knowledge both in theoretical and practical terms. In the Brazilian case, the scenario is even more intriguing, given that the country is struggling to recover from a strong economic recession that started in 2014. Thus, this paper aims to shed light on how the proportion of MUF relates to characteristics of franchised chains, such as spatial dispersion, royalties, and specific and intangible assets We triangulate three theoretical lenses to compose a model predicting the proportion of stores belonging to MUF. From agency theory, we examine attributes related to outlets’ spatial positioning and the assumed effect on monitoring costs and incentives according to agency theory. The relative importance of systemic (franchisor) and local (franchisee) intangible assets is derived from property-rights theory. Finally, the role of asset specificity is extracted from transaction cost economics. Thus, the three strands shape the conceptual basis for developing the set of hypotheses that constitute the model of analysis, which are tested using a sample containing 202 franchise chains associated with the Brazilian Franchising Association (ABF). The sample consists of data from 2018. Although the analysis emphasizes the proportion of MUF outlets, our econometric models also treat as dependent variables the proportion of company-owned outlets and the proportion of outlets pertaining to SUF (single-unit franchisees). In doing so, the analysis is enriched by the comparability between modes. The results indicate that aspects such as contiguity of markets (proximity and similarity), uniformity, protection and preservation of the brand's value proposal seem to be related to the greater presence of MUFs in our sample. Conversely, when franchisee's intangible assets are more important in the franchisor's assessment, the MUF outlet proportion is lower, confirming the property-rights view's predictions. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES 2.1.Agency Theory Agency theory explains franchising as a response to vertical problems like shirking (Mathewson & Winter, 1985). The allocation of ownership of the unit to the local agent aims to enhance incentives to her/his effort to obtain income/wealth from the unit's performance. In return, the agent (the franchisee) pays fees and acquires inputs from the franchisor. Thus, the classic hypothesis is that a higher level of geographic dispersion of a chain’s units increases monitoring costs and induces the chain manager to operate with more franchised units. In MUF arrangements, the store managers’ status as employees appears again, and following the rationale of this aspect, the strength of the current incentives would be reduced (Bradach, 1995). However, it is assumed that a MUF has closer physical proximity to its units than the franchisor (Garg, Rasheed, & Priem, 2005). Thus, concerning the agent's effort, the level of information asymmetry tends to be mitigated both by the physical proximity and by the greater local knowledge of the multi-unit franchisee. However, if the chain deals with a level of total dispersion that exceeds the monitoring capacity of even the closest multi-unit franchisees, the comparative advantage of MUFs would be reduced to the point where it is more advantageous to operate with more SUFs. Therefore, geographic dispersion is expected to be associated with a greater franchised proportion, but if the dispersion level rises too much, more SUFs are expected. Formally, we have:  Higher levels of geographic dispersion will be positively associated with the proportion of franchised outlets, but this relationship will be less strong with MUFs. The franchised arrangement does not eliminate opportunities for undesired action by agents. When operating under a shared brand, franchisees may be tempted to save inputs and efforts while charging prices and margins typical of the chain. Hence, this saving permits benefits in the short term, while sharing with other players the loss of reputation (and future revenues) resulting from the worse quality in the long run. The free riding effect (Combs, Michael, & Castrogiovanni, 2004) damages the network's reputation and the brand value. One way of dealing with this problem is for the franchisor to increase monitoring, but that would run counter to the franchise's raison d'être. Lower royalties could serve as horizontal incentives because this condition allocates a larger fraction of the unit’s residual income. This is particularly interesting if the franchised chain’s brand is still a developing asset (Lafontaine, 1992). However, MUFs can help franchisors to charge higher royalties. First, MUFs have more opportunities to increase earnings through potential economies of scale. This happens because MUFs can dilute fixed costs in more units (Garg, Priem, & Rasheed, 2013). Also, the risk of free riding is reduced since MUFs will absorb part of negative externalities resulting from reduced quality, for instance. Moreover, because MUFs have more than one outlet (and proportionally more to lose), they can involve themselves in horizontal monitoring activities in order mitigate losses due to free riding of other chains’ franchisees. In short, we propose that:  The relationship between the royalties and the proportion of MUF outlets is positive. The second aspect of horizontal problems is the relationship between MUFs, and the contiguity of markets (location) of the units. Contiguous markets are defined here as close locations, both in distance and socioeconomic aspects. According to Garg et al. (2005), the positioning of various outlets of a single franchisee in nearby markets encourages the emergence of a “motivated monitor”, given that this agent has a residual claim on such units. Multi-unit franchise arrangements make the franchisor more likely to shift residual incentives to the agent at a higher level in the network’s governance, i.e., from the local to the regional level. From the franchisor's point of view, any lost resulting from inefficiencies related to local incentives would be more than offset by gains in the units' performance due to the action of the “monitor” (MUF). Previous studies have indicated that MUFs operate clusters of contiguous stores, which generates more monitoring efficiency and scale returns, for example, in logistics costs, staff management and administrative structure, among others (Grünhagen & Mittelstaedt, 2002; Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004; Perryman & Combs, 2012). Even so, it is beneficial for clusters of outlets to belong to the same player, whether a MUF or the franchisor itself (Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004). The prevalence of MUF outlets is a result of the combined effect of incentives to the agent (now a regional one) and the fact that she/he has more strategic resources and capabilities. Therefore:  The concentration of stores in contiguous markets will be positively associated with the proportion of MUF stores. The division of a country into smaller autonomous territorial entities, such as states or provinces, can affect the similarity or distinction between locations where a chain operates (Klick, Kobayashi, & Ribstein, 2012). In some countries, like the USA, Mexico and Germany, states have a high degree of autonomy, even having their own legislation. In contrast, in Brazil, the 26 states and the Federal District (Brasilia) are under the same corporate, intellectual property, labor and antitrust legislation, which does not prevent the existence of substantial differences in terms of sociodemographic, tax and logistical characteristics. The operation of a chain in different states exposes the franchisor to a dispersion scenario that includes physical distance and different contexts (Lafontaine & Shaw, 2005). Therefore, monitoring is more difficult while franchisees’ local knowledge grows in importance. As we said before, the term “local” gains another connotation: it is not a specific location, but a region or even an entire state. This raises the required level of knowledge about the environment. Once again, the “motivated monitor” character appears, as mentioned above. Thus, the following hypothesis is stated:  The chain's presence in many states will be positively associated with the proportion of MUF stores. 2.2.Property Rights The level of contractibility of intangible assets important for the generation of residual gains has a strong influence on a company's ownership structure (Hart & Moore, 1990; Hart, 2003). The degree of contractility has to do with contractual parties' ability to specify attributes, encode and transfer property rights to such assets between each other (Windsperger & Dant, 2006; Hussain & Windsperger, 2010). Systemic network assets (such as the brand) and specific local assets (such as the franchisee's local knowledge) are examples of intangible assets with low contractibility. The relative importance among them - which most contributes to the generation of residual gains for the chain - will be decisive for allocating residual and property rights over units (Windsperger & Dant, 2006). If contractable systemic assets are more important, the franchisor retains more decision and income rights, and a smaller proportion of franchised units is expected, and vice versa (Perryman & Combs, 2012). According to Hussain, Perrigot, Mignonac, Akremi, and Herrbach (2013), in the presence of important intangible assets of the franchisor, the risk of free riding increases, a priori encouraging the chains to use more own stores. However, since MUFs are required to make more specific investments depending on the various units, a bonding effect would be established, discouraging inappropriate behavior, and making the MUF option more attractive. On the other hand, if strictly local intangible assets are more important, the SUF alternative will prevail, since decision rights tend to be allocated to local owners to encourage them to continue investing in such assets. It is expected that if franchisors' perception of the relative importance of local intangible assets is high, SUFs will be prevalent in relation to MUF stores. Formally: The greater the relative importance of the franchisee's local assets, the lower the MUF store proportion will be. Franchising and standardization/control are almost synonymous in terms of achieving system-wide efficiencies and consistency of the brand image (Garg et al., 2005; Meiseberg, 2013). Standardized products benefit the franchising system through image uniformity, quality control, and cost minimization (Kaufmann & Eroglu, 1999). Standardization implies the development of routines that are consistently applied and obeyed to minimize variability in operations (Dada, Watson, & Kirby, 2012). However, franchisees may have private incentives to deviate from such standards (Sorenson & Sørensen, 2001). As a matter of perception, the individual may not be able to achieve sustainable benefits from operating under a strong brand and may make decisions that are out of step with the routines indicated by chain management, aiming at short-term benefits in detriment of the established standards (Dickey, Harrison McKnight, & George, 2007). The risk of inappropriate behavior (free riding) could motivate franchisors to establish standards and routines to improve control. However, the emphasis on standardization can inhibit adaptive responses from local managers to changes in the immediate environment (Cox & Mason, 2007; Pizanti & Lerner, 2003; Dada et al., 2012). Local demographic, economic, or competitive changes may require answers that would not be given if the level of standardization excessively stresses local agents' performance. In other words, the rigidity of controls to mitigate risks of inappropriate behavior would inhibit the ability to respond locally (Hussain & Windsperger, 2013). The MUF literature proposes the coexistence of company-owned and franchised outlet as a strategy to reach both standardization and local adaptive skills (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Meiseberg, 2013). Something similar is proposed by the resource-based view, for which the contractual mix permits franchisors to acquire new knowledge (exploration) and disseminate the use of this knowledge (exploitation) within the chain (Sorenson & Sørensen, 2001). The concept of the contractual mix can be expanded to consider the MUF alternative. MUFs combine resources from owned and franchised stores (SUFs). For example, MUFs are more likely to replicate franchisor practices and routines (Kaufmann & Dant, 1996; Bradach, 1997) because by doing so they can focus on managerial and strategic issues related to their “mini-chains” (Garg et al., 2005; Hussain et al., 2018). In particular, the uniformity of key characteristics (service level, for instance) can affect consumers' perception of the organization, brand image, and reputation. If these aspects vary between units, the brand can be weakened, as well as its market positioning. Our study proposes that if uniformity is a strategic driver prioritized by the franchisor, a positive relationship between such priority and the proportion of MUF stores will be found. Formally: A greater emphasis on operational standardization will be associated with a greater proportion of MUF stores.Monitoring practices aiming to maintain desired standards can take different forms, varying according to the area of operation of the network, the level of experience with the process/product, and the format of its contractual mix (Bradach, 1997; Pizanti & Lerner, 2003). Examples of these practices are inventory turnover control (in the case of retail chains), financial auditing, and field consulting / monitoring. Operational aspects such as health and safety standards, quality of the final product, store layout, and standardization are identified as focal points for face-to-face monitoring of many networks operating in the USA (Cox & Mason, 2007). Cliquet and Groisjean (2002) indicated that some franchisors could reduce the number of company-owned outlets by increasing the number of field auditors, whereas previously such franchisors strategically positioned their units in some locations to evaluate both the market and the franchisee performance. Considering that the maintenance of certain levels of standardization and uniformity is related to the maintenance of the brand value proposal, it is reasonable to expect such interactions, manifested by the presence of the intense use of field auditing, to reflect the network's priority given to such aspects. As a result, a positive – albeit indirect – relationship between the use of field monitors and a greater proportion of MUF stores is expected. Thus: The intensity of field monitoring will be positively associated with the proportion of MUF stores. 2.3.Transaction Costs Franchisees typically make specific investments, which give room for quasi-rents to appear (Vázquez, 2008). According to Perryman and Combs (2012), the risk of expropriation of franchises’ quasi-rents by franchisors would increase the proportion of company-owned outlets because of a lower demand for the brand. To circumvent this problem, franchisors could offer longer contracts to franchisees to protect specific assets developed by the latter during the operation of their units (Vázquez, 2008). However, many franchisors avoid this alternative due to the risk of free riding. This is a paradox, since the increase in the required investment would affect both demand for and supply of new franchises. MUF arrangements can be useful to solve this dilemma. MUFs make larger investments in absolute terms, but they can spread this investment to more than one unit, and they can also benefit from scale, as already mentioned. Such diversification mitigates part of the investment risk. Franchisees with more units also tend to have greater bargaining power, reducing space for the franchisor's opportunistic behavior (Boulay et al., 2016). On the other hand, from the franchisor's point of view, higher exit barriers are expected with greater numbers of units a franchisee has, which can contribute to reducing litigation (BERCOVITZ, 2004). Thus, one can expect a reduction in transaction costs. In short, we expect that the greater the specific investments demanded from franchisees, the greater the proportion of MUFs in the network will tend to be. Formally:  The higher the investment in specific local assets, the greater will be the proportion of MUF stores.METHODOLOGY Figure 1 presents schematically the model and summarizes the set of hypotheses. Solid lines represent expected positive relationships, and dashed lines represent expected negative ones (in this case, only H2a). The model includes control variables for the industry nature (retail or service), size, and maturity. The proper explanation for its use will be presented later in the text. The first source of information was the ABF Official Franchise Guide in base-year 2018. However, information pertinent to the proportion of outlets belonging to multi-unit franchisees is not included in this publication. Therefore, it was necessary to develop an instrument to collect data related to the proportion of MUF outlets and other variables present in the model. We opted for the development of a self-administered questionnaire following research strategies previously adopted in the literature in multi-unit franchises, such as Hussain et al. (2018), Boulay et al. (2016) and Grissmair et al. (2014), among others. All 963 associated networks received the questionnaires, and 215 responses were obtained, of which only 202 responses could be considered valid. The third source of data for the study was the web pages of the networks that answered the questionnaire satisfactorily. The main data collected here were the addresses of the units of our sample. This collection took place between April and May 2018. Finally, it was necessary to access data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) to obtain information such as latitude and longitude of Brazilian municipalities. We also emphase that in some cases conflicting information was observed in some franchisors' responses. For example, in the Official Franchise Guide, chains report the number of company-owned and franchised outlets. Then, the number of outlets is available. Sometimes these numbers were discrepant in relation to the number of outlets informed by chains at their websites. When this fact was noticed, we either asked the ABF itself to resolve the doubt or contacted the franchisor for clarification. Figure 1 - Theoretical Model3.1.Variables and analysis method We tested the proportion of MUFs’ outlets (PMUF), SUFs’ outlets (PSUF) and company-owned outlets (PCO) as dependent variables in three models: an ordinary least squares (OLS) model, logistic regression with fractional response, and a Tobit model (0 and 1 censored). This allowed certifying the consistency of the estimators in different econometric models. OLS regression has the advantage of simplicity of its estimation, but it has the disadvantage of predicting values less than zero and greater than one. The logistic estimation method (logit) was applied to correct this disadvantage. It considers a binary response model for the dependent variable, adjusting its estimation between zero and one (Wooldridge, 2002). However, although it is useful to evaluate the consistency of the results (and the applied OLS), a not insignificant part of the sample is concentrated in values equal to 0. Thus, a Tobit model was applied because it deals better with problems of corner selection; that is, several observations in the sample having y = 0 (there are no MUF stores in the chain), and the rest are continuously distributed along with positive values (Wooldridge, 2002, p. 538). The logit and Tobit models' estimation were performed using the ‘fracreg’ function proposed by Papke and Wooldridge (1996), recommended for dependent variables limited and fractioned between zero and one (Papke &Wooldridge, 1996, 2008). 3.2.Independent variables GEODISP seeks to capture the effect of the units' geographical dispersion among themselves and the franchisor. We used data from the municipalities where our sample’s chains have outlets. These data are available at the networks' internet pages. Euclidean distances were applied to the latitude and longitude of these cities. We assumed that networks with concentrated units are more easily monitored than networks with units more spread over the Brazilian territory. Thus, cluster analysis was applied to define groups of units that each network presents to consider the distance between the groups and not just the distance between units. Finally, the variable was created by adding, for each chain, the Euclidean distance between the stores of each group and the Euclidean distance of the groups. Larger values are associated with more dispersed networks. ROYALTIES are represented by the percentage of gross revenue that chains charge franchisees. This operationalization follows previous studies that have investigated the behavior of franchise rates, such as Wimmer and Garen (1997), Maruyama and Yamashita (2012), and Vásquez (2005). The contiguity effect of markets is operated with two variables. The first one considers the average number of outlets per city () of the chains. Our perception is that different units of the same chain operating in the same city tend to deal with a high contiguity level. The OPC variable involves dividing the total units by the total number of cities where chains are present. The second variable related to contiguity - STATES - considers the number of Brazilian states in which the network has operations. The next three variables are used based on the assumptions derived from the property rights view. The first one - LOCAL-ASSET - seeks to capture the franchisor's perception of local assets’ relative importance. The operationalization of this variable considers franchisors' responses to the questionnaire. In this case, a five-point Likert question was sent to franchisors: “the franchisee's local assets (such as knowledge of the local market, the business, etc.) are more important than the network's value proposition than system assets (brand, business format update, etc.).” The variable UNIFORMITY also seeks to capture the construct through responses to the questionnaire. However, to operationalize the franchisor's assignment of importance of uniformity to the network’s success, principal component analysis was employed to reduce three questions into one. In this case, using a five-point Likert scale, the importance of uniformity in terms of (i) the opening period of the store/unit, (ii) the level of service practiced, and (iii) price/margin practiced by the franchisee. However, this operationalization imposes some limitations on our results, considering that the extracted factor explained only 46.79% of the total variance and the low Cronbach’s alpha obtained in the reliability test (0.479). FIELD AUDIT seeks to capture consultancy and field auditing to maintain the desired level of uniformity. The variable allows testing the hypothesis . Here, too, a direct question with a five-point Likert scale was presented to the franchisors: \"our network makes intense use of a field consultants as a way of maintaining the standards required of our franchisees.\" Furthermore, the model is inspired by the transaction cost savings and considers the effect of specific assets on the networks’ contractual mix. We use a single variable: INITIAL-INVESTMENT. This is the outlay reported by the network to open an outlet. These data are available in the ABF Official Franchise Guide, being informed, in most cases, between a maximum and minimum investment amount. To reduce the bias of assuming that the data’s average would approximate reality, we decided to take the minimum values. Therefore, there is a lower limit for store size related to the business's particular characteristics. Our model contains three control variables. The first one – RETAIL – is a dichotomous variable to indicate whether the chain's business model is aimed at retailing (0) or services (1). This variable allows controlling the differences in terms of capacity for remote monitoring. The attributes of the products sold by retail stores are typically more objective when compared to the service sector. Besides, profit margins on input prices tend to be tighter in retailing, causing the need to allocate more stores to the same franchisee to allow them greater opportunities for gain. Also, we included two variables to capture differences in terms of network maturity and size. The first considers the period (in years) that the chain has adopted the franchise model. The second is the product between the total number of units and the average gross revenue per unit reported in the ABF Official Franchise Guide. RESULTS Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the variables used in the study. The differences in the magnitude of the different scales indicated the need to standardize continuous variables. Another important aspect of Table 1 is the absence of the UNIFORMITY variable. As explained, this variable was obtained by extracting a common factor from three responses given by the franchisors regarding the perceived importance of maintaining standards regarding (i) store opening times, (ii) prices and margins practiced by franchisees, and (iii) level of service offered. The extracted factor is a standardized variable, so it would have little to report in the Table 1. Therefore, we chose to report the original variables on which the models' variable was constituted.

Table 2 shows the significant Pearson correlations at 5%. Some higher correlations (above 40%) stand out and demand explanation. For example, the proportion of owned stores (PERC-LP) has a stronger negative correlation with the proportion of franchised stores: SUFs (-51.67%) and MUFs (-62.77%), which is natural (the more own stores, the fewer franchised stores, and vice versa). However, the variables SIZE and MATURITY have some high correlations, both between each other and with the variables related to the networks' dispersion, which confirms the need to use them as control variables. Naturally, larger and longer-lived networks will tend to be spread over a larger area. All other correlations are moderate to insignificant. Even so, to verify multicollinearity problems between variables in the OLS method, we applied variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis and found no multicollinearity problems.

Before the estimations of the model of this first stage, we applied basic tests to validate the econometric assumptions, among them: Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test, to investigate issues of residual homoscedasticity and the variance inflation factor test (VIF), to analyze the assumption of regarding multicollinearity Table 3 – Results of econometric models Dependent Variable PCO PSUF PMUF OLS LOGIT (fracreg) TOBIT (fracreg) OLS LOGIT (fracreg) TOBIT (fracreg) OLS LOGIT (fracreg) TOBIT (fracreg) GEODISP 0.05*** 0.39* 0.08*** -0.05 -0.19 -0.03 -0.00 0.00 0.01 ROYALTIES -0.02 0.22 0.05 -0.05 -0.02 -0.01 0.05 0.14 -0.01 OPC -0.03*** -0.25** -0.03*** -0.02 -0.01 -0.02 0.05*** 0.24*** 0.06*** STATES -0.08*** -0.68*** -0.09*** -0.01 -0.05 -0.01 0.09*** 0.45*** 0.12*** LOCAL ASSETS 0.01 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.09 0.02 -0.02* -0.13** -0.03** UNIFORMITY 0.01 0.09 0.03 -0.02 -0.09 -0.02 0.03* 0.15* 0.03* FIELD AUDIT 0.00 0.03 0.01 -0.04** -0.14** -0.03* 0.03** 0.18** 0.04** INITIAL INVEST 0.05*** 0.40*** 0.07*** -0.08*** -0.54*** -0.13*** 0.03 0.13 0.03 RETAIL 0.06* 0.47** 0.07* -0.14*** -0.55*** -0.13*** 0.09*** 0.48*** 0.10** SIZE 0.02 0.05 -0.01 0.01 -0.06 -0.02 -0.03 -0.19 -0.05 MATURITY -0.03** -0.37* -0.05** 0.00 0.04 0.01 0.02 0.14* 0.04** 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 0.26 0,23 0,29 F-statistic 107.56 159.61 5,17 59,42 9,05 9,51 731.73 69,46 85,13 Ramsey test (1969): Test statistic 1.71 1.53 1.16 Probability > F 0.17 0.21 0.33 * Significant at 10%; ** Significant at 5%; *** Significant at 1%.

The first problem is dealt with by applying the Ramsey reset test (Ramsey, 1969), verifying the relevant variable omission problem in the model. The test did not indicate potential problems of omitting a relevant variable. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS The most surprising result is the rejection of . Our results indicate an unexpected positive and significant sign between the level of geographical dispersion and which contradicts decades of research in franchising. There is no significant relationship between geographic dispersion and SUF- or MUF-proportion in our sample. One possible explanation is the severe recession that Brazil experienced between 2014 and 2017 and whose effects have not yet completely dissipated as of this writing. Brazilian GDP is still far from recovering from the historic high of 2008 (source: World Bank). Considering that, as mentioned above, recent studies in Brazil have indicated discrepant results, the positive relationship between geographic dispersion and more company-owned outlets may indicate the closing of franchised units and/or repurchasing of the former franchised units by franchisors.  predicts a negative relationship between ROYALTIES and the proportion of MUF stores. This hypothesis was not supported. There is no evidence that networks with more MUFs charge higher royalties. ROYALTIES is not significant in any alternative of the analyzed contract mix, which indicates that this is not an attribute related to governance and instead is more associated with pricing and compensation (Polo-Redondo, Bordonaba-Juste, & Palacios, 2011). However, the results contradict the tradition of agency theory that proposes the adjustment of royalty rates as incentive mechanisms for franchisees (Pénard, Raynaud, & Saussier, 2003; Chen, Wang, & Yang, 2015). Incentives and monitoring are at the heart of the “agency” discussion related to franchising. Similarly, the data indicate a disconnect between geographic dispersion and the franchised proportion, an aspect related to monitoring costs. This imbalance also indicates the absence of influence of incentives on the arrangement.  received partial support. Although we found a positive relationship between the contiguity of markets and the proportion of MUF outlets, we also expected to see the same in the case of company-owned outlets, as in Kalnins and Lafontaine (2004), which did not happen. This result, in a sense, relates to what we found in  If greater geographic dispersion appears to be positively associated with more company-owned outlets, the opposite seems to be true since the  variable captures concentration of units. Although the negative sign for the SUF percentage is not significant, it corroborates our interpretation.  proposes that the presence in more states in Brazil will be associated with more MUFs, and to a lesser extent, also with more company-owned outlets. We found similar results as those for  in terms of signs and significance (although both are negatively correlated, as shown in Table 2). The presence in many states leads to increased monitoring costs, but also involves consideration of the contiguity of markets and leads to a greater franchisor dependence on franchisees’ local knowledge. By allocating several outlets to the same agent, the franchisor allows it to benefit from gains in scale that result in part from local market knowledge. The (partial) support for  appears to be evidence of this - MUFs become an alternative precisely because they demand fewer resources to monitor.  receives considerable support. It proposes that the greater importance given by franchisors to local intangible assets (beyond local knowledge) is associated with a lower proportion of MUFs in the contractual mix. Moreover, the sign is positive for SUF-proportion, although not significant. The results also support previous works such as Hussain and Windsperger (2010, 2011, 2013), which indicate that the presence of local intangible assets important for the generation of residual rents impacts the allocation of decision/property rights in franchised networks. If these assets grow in importance, becoming essential for the unit's success, the franchisor tends to adopt less intense arrangements in terms of control (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014), so that SUF arrangements prevail. Also, we interpret that MUF arrangements imply a large amount of these types of assets accumulated in some agents' hands, which would leave the franchisor exposed to greater franchisee bargaining power.  suggests a greater proportion of MUFs if the franchisor prioritizes uniformity in local processes. The data supported this hypothesis. The estimator is negative, although not significant, for the PSUF, while it is positive and significant for the MUF-proportion. Moreover, the support obtained by  (the third hypothesis related to property rights) reinforces the result for the relationship between uniformity and the MUF alternative. This hypothesis proposes that field auditing/consulting to monitor and direct the level of uniformity in the different units is associated with a higher proportion of MUFs. In fact, the relationship between the intensity of use of this device has a negative and significant association with the proportion of SUF outlets. In contrast, it is positive and significantly associated with the proportion of MUF stores.  proposes that greater local specific investments will be associated with a greater proportion of MUFs. The data do not support this hypothesis. The estimator is positive and significant for the proportion of company-owned outlets, while it is negative and significant for SUF-proportion. Despite the positive sign, the estimator is not significant for the proportion of MUF stores. These results regarding the specificity of assets also go against previous research (Hussain & Windsperger, 2010, 2011; Hussain et al., 2013; Hussain et al., 2018). Considering that these studies cover markets with a lower level of environmental uncertainty (France, Austria, Switzerland and Germany), a possible explanation for the present results is a higher level of vertical integration due to the instability of the Brazilian institutional environment, especially considering the political and economic disturbances seen in recent years. Additionally, we realize that the operationalization of the INITIAL_INVEST variable, although inspired by previous studies, may not be able to capture the effect of asset specificity in isolation. In the same way that geographic dispersion (GEODISP) appears positively related to more company-owned outlets, the Brazilian economic situation may have reduced the number of potential franchisees with the necessary resources to open stores. Regarding the control variables, RETAIL presents a positive and significant sign concerning both MUF- and company-owned outlets. In contrast, the sign is opposite (maintaining significance) for the SUF-proportion. When comparing company-owned and MUF outlets, the magnitude of the estimators found for the MUF-proportion is consistently higher across the three models. We realize that the results involve with both property rights and agency theories. In the first case, retail chains tend to deal with lower monitoring costs than in the service sector since units' performance evaluation relies on more objective measures, such as inventory turnover. As a result, the demand for local managers' incentive mechanisms can be less, allowing the network (or MUFs) to retain more residual rents from their units. This reasoning can be extended to issues related to local assets' contractibility; an aspect discussed within the scope of property rights theory. Given the characteristic tangibility of operations with goods, a lower allocation of decision rights to the local agent by the network management would be expected, given the greater ability to measure more objectively the local manager's contribution to the success of the operation. Although SIZE is not significant, MATURITY showed a negative and significant relationship with the proportion of company-owned outlets, which has been verified in previous studies in Brazil (Davidovitsch, Caldas, & Silva, 2009) and abroad (Castrogiovanni, Combs, & Justis, 2006; Shane, Shankar, & Aravindakshan, 2006). Although the positive relationship between the system's maturity and the proportion of franchised outlets is not unanimous (for example, in Alon, (2001), the results are in line with most traditional theories applied to franchising studies. Although pioneering studies based on the resource scarcity view expected the franchised proportion to drop as the network became more mature - indicating a negative quadratic pattern (U-shape) - Castrogiovanni et al. (2006) identified a cubic pattern in this relationship, explained by the observation that scarce resources would impact the network much more in the initial years of its operation, while coordination (or agency) costs would start to affect the network as its brand and value proposition consolidated over time. FINAL COMMENTS This study sheds light on the presence of multi-unit franchisees in Brazilian chains. While the geographical dispersion of units does not seem to be a relevant factor in the current scenario, the presence in a greater diversity of scenarios (approximated by the number of Brazilian states) appears to be related to a greater proportion of MUF outlets. In fact, the issue of geographic dispersion is not related to the franchised proportion in general, suggesting that franchisors have been closing or repurchasing franchised units, perhaps a consequence of the Brazilian recession. Two factors strongly associated with MUFs were the location of units in contiguous markets and a greater emphasis on standardization and uniformity. On the other hand, a smaller proportion of MUF outlets was found when the franchisor realize that local intangible resources are decisive for units’ success. In such cases, franchisors appear to be allocating ownership of the assets and the residual operation to the local (and not regional) owner. We believe there are three main theoretical contributions of this study. First, it provides evidence that vertical agency issues (the decision to make the agent a residual claimant) may become secondary in economic instability scenarios. In adjusting governance in such scenarios, the franchisor may choose to take over its stores' operation and not lose markets. The monitoring of this trend over time, including after recovery from the Brazilian recession, may shed more light on this dynamic. The second theoretical contribution is in the conceptual scope of the developed model. The model triangulates three theoretical strands - agency theory, property rights theory, and transaction cost savings - and still maintains a “dialog” with the resource-based view. By detecting the loss of connection between geographic dispersion and franchise proportion, the model brings to the debate a vision of scarce resources. Similarly, when considering the emphasis on uniformity and intensity of field monitoring, aspects of knowledge transmission discussed within the resource-based view are considered. Furthermore, by triangulating different data sources, aspects of validity are strengthened, increasing the results' robustness. Finally, the third theoretical contribution is to bring to emerging markets such as Brazil a discussion so far restricted to more mature and consolidated markets such as the USA, European Union and Australia. In addition to the well-known institutional weaknesses, as mentioned several times, Brazil is still experiencing the consequences of a strong economic recession that affected the franchising sector. ABF data indicate that, for the first time in history, the number of franchise chains dropped (by almost 7%) between 2016 and 2017 (in terms of revenue, the decline was approximately 10%). A further theoretical step would be to measure the relationship between MUFs and network performance. However, some limitations suggest caution regarding the interpretation of the results. One is the cross-sectional nature of the study. These studies fail to capture causality, so this attribute is solely dependent on theory. As a result, the level of internal validity achieved is not high, requiring further research efforts to develop longitudinal studies or field studies to obtain historical data. Another is the operationalization of some variables that demand more sophistication. For example, the construct validity of the variable used to capture specific local assets (investment to open a new store) may capture other effects such as scarcity of resources. Future studies related to this topic could contribute to the improvement of these measures. \n",

Combining individual-level and dyad-level data from 120 franchisor-franchisee relationships within a franchise network, we test how two contextual conditions (i.e. the franchisor’s trust in a franchisee and the franchisor’s network control) moderate the impact of franchisee economic outcomes (i.e. economic satisfaction) and social outcomes (i.e. trust in the franchisor and trust in peers) on their network exit intentions and subsequent exit behaviors. As predicted by Social Exchange Theory (SET), the franchisor’s trust in franchisee is beneficial for maintaining exchange relationships; economic satisfaction only reduces franchisee exit intentions when franchisor’s trust in franchisee is high. Contrary to SET, high franchisor’s trust in franchisee has only marginal value for the franchisee when the franchisee already trusts the franchisor. Next, a high franchisor’s network control weakens the negative (network-stabilizing) effect of economic satisfaction on franchisees’ exit intentions, and strengthens the positive, (network-destabilizing) effect of franchisees’ trust in peers on their network exit intentions. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the promoting and undermining roles of franchisor’s trust and network control for the management of franchisee network exit intentions.Keywords: control;network exits; social exchange; trust; direct and generalized exchanges.INTRODUCTION Effective cooperation in franchise networks requires coordination of resources and actions of partners with mixed motives. Many studies have therefore focused on franchise relationship issues, such as trust, conflicts, compliance (Grünhagen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). Yet, relatively few studies have addressed the reasons why franchisees intend to leave their franchise networks (exceptions are Morrison, 1997; Frazer & Winzar, 2005; Mignonac et al., 2015: López-Fernández & López-Bayon, 2018). This relative lack of theoretical understanding is surprising, given the serious consequences of franchisee network exits. Our study increases the understanding of why and under what contextual conditions franchisees leave their networks.  We adopt Social Exchange Theory (SET) by arguing that franchise networks uniquely combine contractual direct exchanges between the franchisor (as the network leader) and individual franchisees with generalized exchanges among the franchisees, resulting in a unique trust-control interplay that affects franchisee behaviors. Most SET studies focus on direct reciprocity in dyadic exchanges, such as leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships (e.g., Bagger & Li, 2014), or alliance relationships (e.g., Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). However, in franchise networks, franchisees are also in a generalized exchange with their peers (i.e. franchisees in the same network) and thus face generalized reciprocity; that is quid pro quo exchanges within the group but not necessarily with any specific franchisee (cf. Das & Teng, 2002a; Heidl et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet examined how outcomes derived from direct and generalized exchanges influence franchisees’ tendency to leave their franchise networks.  Franchisee network exits can have severe consequences for a network’s viability (e.g., Mignonac et al., 2015). Moreover, exiting franchisees may spawn into new ventures or join competing networks, or they may even exit collectively and jointly start new competing networks (Croonen & Brand, 2010). The few studies that explain franchisee network exit intentions typically focus on the effects of franchisees’ unilateral perceptions direct exchange outcomes with the franchisor (e.g., López-Fernández & López-Bayon, 2018; Meek et al., 2011). We extend these studies by arguing that the combination of direct  generalized exchanges leads to specific economic and social exchange outcomes and trust and control challenges. We include the franchisor’s trust in each franchisee and its network control as important contextual conditions that shape franchisee valuation of exchange outcomes (cf., Das & Teng, 2001; Long & Sitkin, 2018). To test our hypotheses, we analyze primary data collected in one franchise network, including - among others - dyadic data of 120 franchisor-franchisee dyads, franchisee exit intentions, and subsequent exit behaviors (for a post-study check). We make three contributions to franchising research. First, by incorporating the franchisor’s trust in each individual franchisee as important contextual condition, we assess dyadic franchisor-franchisee relationships as opposed to relying solely on franchisee unilateral perceptions. Trust asymmetry may exist in leader-member dyads (e.g., Graebner et al., 2018; Korsgaard et al., 2015), and the inclusion of both franchise partners’ trusting perspectives shows the impact of symmetric and asymmetric trust constellations on franchisee network exit intentions. Our inclusion of perceptions from both franchiseparties is essential as they form the foundation of mutual reciprocity (Brower et al., 2000; 2009). We demonstrate that the effects of franchisee exchange outcomes on their network exit intentions vary according to the trust of the franchisor in them.  Second, franchisors perform an important network control function by monitoring the behaviors and outputs of franchisees to safeguard franchisee quality output and cooperation, and hence exchange outcomes (Combs & Ketchen, 2003; Kasyhap et al., 2012). We introduce franchisee assessments of the franchisor’s network control as a relevant contextual condition to explain their network exit intentions. Our results show that the franchisor’s network control can seriously damage the continuation of franchise relationships. High levels of network control may make franchisees indifferent to positive economic outcomes and may incline franchisees with high trust in their peers to forge activities outside the network.  Third, we adopt a multi-referent perspective on trust – as a social outcome of exchange relationships (Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012; Zaheer et al., 1998) – to develop a more fine-grained understanding of how trust impacts franchisee exit intentions. We show that while trust between the franchisor and franchisees strengthens the network and reduces franchisee network exits, trust among franchisee peers may damage the network by encouraging franchisees to (jointly) exit the network in high network-control situations. The mechanism behind this exit-promoting effect is that franchisees’ trust in each other facilitates peer cooperation, learning, and coalition formation (cf., Greve et al., 2010; Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012). Operating as a collective, franchisees can gain leverage against the powerful franchisor and restore the power balance in their favor, or establish the capability to pursue outside options collectively.  In sum, we demonstrate the pivotal roles of the franchisor’s trust and control in shaping franchisee network exit intentions as they differentially impact their valuations of economic and social exchange outcomes and thereby moderate the effects of franchisee perceived exchange outcomes on their network exit intentions. THEORETICAL BACKGROUNDS AND HYPOTHESES SET in a Franchise Context SET is a broad and influential paradigm for understanding intentions and behaviors in exchange relationships (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). SET’s basic tenet is that individuals enter, maintain, and exit relationships based on the past and anticipated outcomes that accompany them (Blau, 1964). Depending on the type of exchange, partners may seek different types of exchange outcomes (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). Social exchange as an ongoing reciprocal process in which exchanges of benefits between parties result in social norms of obligation and reciprocity. Moreover, some exchange partners may be more powerful than others, resulting in power asymmetry and relational tensions (Blau, 1964; Cook & Emerson, 1978; Das & Teng 2002b). In recent decades, SET has become a popular perspective in examining business relationships (Coyle-Shapiro & Diehl, 2018; Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). Business exchange partners typically base their decisions to stay in or leave their relationships on the perceived economic and social outcomes derived from these relationships (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Rowley et al., 2005). In our study, the economic outcomes comprise franchisee satisfaction with the economic results from their franchise network membership. Moreover, since exchange is risky, contracts are incomplete, and perfect network control is impossible (Blau, 1964; Das & Teng, 1998, 2001, 2002b), franchisee trust in their franchisor and trust in their peers are two important social outcomes that directly affect their network exit intentions. Moreover, through their trust and network control behaviors, franchisors govern the direct and generalized exchange context of franchisees and thereby play a critical role in franchisee outcome valuations (cf., Das & Teng, 2001; Long & Sitkin, 2018). Figure 1 depicts our theoretical framework and hypotheses, which we explain in more detail below.  -------------------------- Insert Figure 1 about here -------------------------- Direct Effects of Economic and Social Exchange Outcomes Economic exchange outcomes. Economic satisfaction comprises the (dis)confirmation of economic or instrumental expectations over the history of the exchange relationship (Rowley et al., 2005). When economic outcomes are below expectations, partners become dissatisfied and may pursue alternative options (Blau, 1964; Lambe et al., 2001). Economic outcomes are important in franchise networks because franchisees cooperate to ultimately gain economically from the relationship (Davies et al., 2011), and franchisee satisfaction with economic outcomes lowers their network exit intentions (Meek et al., 2011; Mignonac et al., 2015). Hence: Hypothesis 1a: Franchisee economic satisfaction is negatively related with network exit intentions.  Social exchange outcomesTrust is a necessary ingredient for stable relationships and a relevant social outcome in business relationships (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). Trust reduces partners’ perceived exchange risks resulting from having exchange partners that are not willing or able to reciprocate (Das & Teng, 2001; 2002b), and it helps partners to bond emotionally (Lambe et al., 2001; Rowley et al., 2005). Trust reflects a partner’s positive expectations that the other partner will reciprocate by fulfilling its obligations in the exchange relationship (Blau, 1964; Lambe et al., 2001). Extant SET studies typically focus on trust in a single referent, whereas it is important to consider multiple trust referents (Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012; Long & Sitkin, 2018). We identify franchisee trust in the franchisor  trust in peers as essential social outcomes. Franchisee trust in franchisor. Economic motives between franchisors and franchisees are not fully aligned (Combs et al., 2004; López-Fernández & López-Bayon, 2018). From the franchisee perspective, risks resulting from this are aggravated by the asymmetrical control of the franchisor which provides the leader with power over the members (Croonen, 2010). Franchisees are thus vulnerable to their franchisor’s actions, which makes trust in the franchisor important to franchisees. This trust is crucial to maintaining the relationship by reducing franchisee perceived direct exchangerisks via stronger goal alignment and greater likelihood of goal attainment (cf. Das & Teng, 2001; Davies et al., 2011). If franchisees expect their franchisor to be willing and able to fulfill its exchange obligations, they are more likely to anticipate positive future economic outcomes and to reciprocate. Hence: Hypothesis 1b: Franchisee trust in franchisor is negatively related with network exit intentions.  Franchisee trust in peers.Based on one stream within SET (Das & Teng, 2002a), one could argue that since franchisees operate under a shared business format within a network, they are all affected by their peers’ contributions to shared goals and resources. Franchisees must thus trust that their peers are willing and able to comply with the franchisor’s guidelines and norms (Combs et al., 2004). Franchisees typically rely on the franchisor to coordinate the generalized exchange among franchisees. Moreover, franchisee trust in peers decreases their perceptions of the generalized exchange risks and increase the perceived likelihood of positive future economic outcomes, which may lower franchisee intentions to leave the network (cf., Das & Teng, 2002a).  However, within SET there is also a research stream accounting for power differences among exchange partners, which would propose an opposite effect. The way in which trust impacts behaviors varies according to the power of the individual actor relative to its counterparts (Blau, 1964). A franchisor usually has more power than its individual franchisees due to the contractual relationship in which the franchisor imposes obligations on franchisees (cf., Davies et al., 2011; Human & Provan, 2000). Several SET scholars have argued that unbalanced power relations are inherently instable and produce frictions and tensions among parties, such that less powerful parties engage in one or several ‘balancing operations’, such as withdrawal and coalition formation (e.g., Cook & Emerson, 1978; Emerson, 1962, 1964; Greve et al., 2010). Thus, in dealing with their franchisor, franchisees are continuously incentivized to engage in balancing operations to move the balance in their favor. Peer trust may facilitate such operations via different forms of peer cooperation (Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012) and cohesion (Greve et al., 2010). Actors who trust their peers share more information and knowledge and are more likely to help each other (El Akremi et al., 2011; Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012) by jointly taking on functional tasks (Human & Provan, 1997), and forming coalitions (Croonen & Brand, 2010; Greve et al., 2010). The collective learning and countervailing power enable the pursuit of difficult yet potentially rewarding opportunities outside the focal network that cannot be attained individually (Greve et al., 2010). As franchisees’ trust in peers boosts their confidence and opportunities to seek such outside options, it is hypothesized to increase franchisees’ propensity to (jointly) leave the network. Hence: Hypothesis 1c: Franchisee trust in peers is positively related with network exit intentions.  Moderating Effects of the Franchisor’s Trust and Control Trust and control determine the effective governance of cooperative relationships through affecting partners’ perceived exchange risks (e.g., Das & Teng, 2001; Long & Sitkin, 2018). In franchise networks, the franchisor shapes the franchisees’ valuations of exchange outcomes through its trust in specific franchisees (cf., direct leader-member exchanges) and through its network control behaviors aimed at controlling the generalized exchange among the franchisees. Franchisor’s trust in franchisees. In line with LMX research, we argue that franchisees are sensitive to the franchisor’s trust in them as it creates a safe and fulfilling relational context for them (cf. Brower et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2013). If the franchisor trusts a franchisee, it tends to display positive signals and trusting behaviors towards this franchisee, signaling to the trusted franchisee that it appreciates the relationship, intends to continue it and anticipates future gains from cooperation. Trusted franchisees feel more valued because they attain more status, encouragement, coaching and support (Bagger & Li, 2014; Brower et al., 2009).  Regarding the economic outcomes, franchisees who are trusted by the franchisor may attribute their economic outcomes to result from a joint effort with the franchisor rather than from an individual effort (cf., Gong et al., 2013; Lambe et al., 2001). The status, encouragement, coaching and support that trusted franchisees receive from their franchisors make them feel like they are part of a preferred ‘ingroup’ (Lau & Liden, 2008), making these franchisees more aware of the added value of the franchise network for achieving their economic outcomes. We hypothesize that trusted franchisees will more strongly reduce their exit intentions based on their economic satisfaction compared with franchisees who are not trusted by the franchisor. Building on these arguments, we hypothesize the following interaction effect:Hypothesis 2:The franchisor’s trust in franchisees strengthens the negative relationship between franchisee economic satisfaction and network exit intentions, such that the negative relationship is stronger for higher levels of franchisor’s trust in franchisees.Regarding the social outcomes, we propose an interaction effect between franchisee trust in the franchisor and franchisor’s trust in franchisees as mutual trust is likely to produce more favorable outcomes (Bagger & Li, 2014; Ferrin et al., 2008). Several LMX studies have argued that when high levels of trust are shared between leaders and members, there is a supportive environment to develop high-quality relationships that reduces mutually perceived exchange risks, which in turn allows for mutually beneficial relationship outcomes (e.g., Brower et al., 2009; Gooty & Yammarino, 2016). Thus, an increase of the franchisee’s trust in the franchisor is particularly effective in situations in which the franchisor trusts the focal franchisee, as this reciprocity triggers positive trust spirals that strongly reduce franchisee exit intentions (Ferrin et al., 2008; Gooty & Yammarino, 2016). In settings of low franchisor’s trust in the franchisee, the franchisee will receive fewer of such reinforcing signals to further build and continue the relationship. Hence: Hypothesis 3: The franchisor’s trust in franchisees strengthens the negative relationship between franchisee trust in franchisor and network exit intentions, such that the negative relationship is stronger for higher levels of franchisor’s trust in franchisees. Franchisor’s network control.Generalized exchanges typically entail a high risk of free-riding due to their ambiguous and disjointed nature (Das & Teng, 2002a; Heidl et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012). Franchisees expect the franchisor to manage these generalized exchange risks by fulfilling a control function. Such control consists of monitoring franchisees’ behaviors and taking corrective actions to maintain high levels of cooperation and guarantee high outcome quality at the network level (Combs et al., 2004; Kasyhap et al., 2012). At the same time, franchisees are independent business owners that are typically critical towards power and control exercised on them since it limits their autonomy (Dada, 2018; Dant & Gundlach, 1999). Network control is a mechanism to protect the franchised business format, but in situations where franchisees perceive such control as excessive, it can lead to their psychological reactance (cf. Heide et al., 2007), and thereby change franchisee valuation of exchange outcomes. We hypothesize that the negative effect of franchisee economic satisfaction on network exit intentions is weaker when franchisees experience high levels of franchisor’s network control. In situations of low franchisor’s control, an increase of economic satisfaction may strongly reduce exit intentions as the low network control allows franchisees to keep some autonomy and to perceive value congruence with the leader (Das & Teng, 2001; Kashyap et al., 2012). However, in high franchisor’s network control situations, similar economic improvements are less effective, because franchisees interpret the franchisor’s network control no longer as network vigilance but as an unnecessary reduction in their autonomy and as a (self-interested) means of the franchisor to coerce franchisor into complying with franchisor-desired behavior (cf., Sitkin et al., 2020). Hence:  Hypothesis 4: The franchisor’s network control attenuates the negative relationship between franchisee economic satisfaction and network exit intentions, such that the relationship is weaker for higher levels of franchisor’s network control. Finally, regarding the social outcomes, we hypothesize that the positive relationship between franchisee trust in peers and network exit intentions becomes even stronger in high network control situations. Trust and control are both mechanisms that will lower franchisee perceived generalized exchange risks within the network, as they facilitate cooperation and reduce opportunistic behaviors. Research has shown that these mechanisms can be complements or substitutes (Long & Sitkin, 2018), suggesting that social control (trust) and formal control (control) can go hand-in-hand or become incompatible, depending on the context and timing (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005). We posit that franchisee (horizontal) trust in each other and the franchisor’s network (vertical) control are to a certain extent incompatible and will generate competitive effects. Peer trust reflects a sharing of norms and social cohesion among like-minded members (Das & Teng, 2002a; Greve et al., 2010), while control consists of franchisees being externally monitored by the franchisor who takes corrective action if needed (Combs et al., 2004; Kasyhap et al., 2012). An increase in peer trust is therefore particularly effective in reducing perceived exchange risks when the franchisor’s leader control is low, as social control mechanisms are then installed and taken care of by the franchisees themselves. In high network control situations, an increase of peer trust would make the strong control of the franchisor to become redundant, costly and even excessive (cf., Heidl et al., 2014). In such situations, franchisees will more easily feel coerced and confined by the franchisor, such that an increase in peer trust will lead to even stronger peer cooperation, coalition formation and withdrawal intentions (cf., Emerson, 1964; Cook & Emerson, 1978) – as compared with low control situations. Hence, network control amplifies the positive effect of a franchisee’s trust in peers on its exit intentions, resulting in: Hypothesis 5: The franchisor’s network control strengthens the positive relationship between franchisee peer trust and network exit intentions, such that the relationship is stronger for higher levels of franchisor network control. RESEARCH METHOD Research Context, Sample, and Data Collection We collected data on franchisor-franchisee relationships within a single franchise network (pseudonym: @Home) providing home services to Dutch customers. The network provides the franchisees with a strong brand name and collective marketing, training, and access to services such as insurance and guarantee schemes. In addition, @Home strictly mandates consistent presentations toward customers (e.g., company uniforms, vehicles), and the use of a shared digital information and communication system.  At the time of data collection, the network had 209 franchisees who usually knew each other personally through, for example, joint meetings and/or joint assignments. The franchisees are all single-unit franchisees. The survey was sent to all franchisees. Of the 135 franchisees who responded to the survey, 120 survey forms were complete. In the same period, the franchisor’s management team provided us with data on their assessment of each franchisee, resulting in data on 120 franchisor-franchisee dyads. The net response rate (57%) is high, and helped to ensure the representativeness of our sample compared to the network’s population. Measures and Measurement Properties The Appendix shows all measurement items. Unless otherwise indicated, all items were measured on five-point Likert scales.Dependent variable. We measurednetwork exit intention using seven items derived from the behavioral loyalty intentions scale developed by Kelloway et al. (1999). Independent variables Economic satisfaction (ES) was measured using four items. These items cover the franchisee’s perceived general business success, satisfaction with its economic performance, realization of its specific economic goals, and relative economic performance compared to the industry (Cochet et al., 2008; Dant & Gundlach, 1999). Franchisee’s trust in franchisor (FTO) was measured with six items derived from Mayer and Gavin (2005) and Searle et al. (2011). Franchisee’s trust in peers (FTP) was measured using four items based on Cook and Wall (1980) and Kiffin-Petersen and Cordery (2003). These studies have used these items to measure organizational members’ trust in their coworkers. These items do not reflect trust in specific peers, but – in line with generalized exchanges and reciprocity – refer to the trust in the population of peers belonging to the franchise network.Moderating variables. To measure the franchisor’s trust in franchisee (FTE), we asked the management of the franchisor’ organization to assess each individual franchisee on three items reflecting the franchisee’s trustworthy behaviors regarding contribution, goodwill, and compliance (cf., Brower et al., 2000). To measure the franchisee’s perception franchisor’s network control (FNC), we developed a three-item scale based on studies on monitoring and enforcement in inter-firm channel relationships (Antia & Frazier, 2001; Kashyap et al., 2012).Control variables. We include franchise relationship and franchisee characteristics as control variables. Franchise relationship characteristics include the duration of the relationship, the member’s assessment of alternatives, and switching costs (Cochet et al., 2008; Meek et al., 2011; Mignonac et al., 2015). For relationship duration (REL), we use the number of years that a franchisee has been part of the @Home network. Four items measure the attractiveness of outside alternatives (ALT), while switching costs (SWI) are measured with three items. Franchisee characteristics include the franchisee’s industry experience. We take the number of years that the franchisee has been active in the specific industry as a measure of industry experience (EXP).Construct Validity and Reliability Prior to conducting the OLS regression with interaction terms, we used SmartPLS 4.0 to assess the validity and reliability of our constructs. We explored the distributions of all items and variables, and since there were no outliers we did not exclude any observations.The Appendix presents the measurement properties of our scales. All scales demonstrate convergent validity since the standardized loadings are both high and highly significant. Furthermore, the AVE of each construct is above the recommended threshold of .5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). There is evidence of discriminant validity in that the square root of the AVE is higher than each of the underlying correlations with the other constructs (see Table 1). Finally, with Cronbach’s alphas above .7 and composite reliabilities above .6, the scales can be considered reliable. To reduce the danger of common method variance in the survey data, we followed Podsakoff et al’s (2003) recommendations; we guaranteed respondents anonymity, varied measurement items and used reversed-coded items, and prevented funneling in the questionnaire design. Moreover, we investigated the degree to which item variance was explained by a single latent common method variance factor and by the corresponding latent variable. The common factor explains on average only 2% of the variance, whereas the corresponding constructs explain 67% of the variance. Only 3 of the 33 paths between the common-method variance factor and the items are significant, indicating that common method bias is not a major concern. RESULTS Descriptive Statistics Table 1 presents the descriptives of our variables and the correlation matrix. A comparison of early and late respondents reveals no significant differences in demographics or in exit intentions, indicating that non-response bias is unlikely to be a problem. Moreover, multicollinearity tests reveal no serious concerns; the largest variance inflation factor was 2.18, which is well below the commonly suggested cut-off value of 10 (Hair et al., 1998).-------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------- Hypotheses Testing We ran multiple OLS regression models to validate our hypotheses. Table 2 presents an overview of the results, and demonstrates the high predictive power of our model. Prior to testing for interaction effects, we ran a baseline regression model including all independent and control variables to predict franchisee network exit intentions (Model 1). We then included the interaction terms (Models 2 and 3) and ran the full model (Model 4). H1a states that franchisee economic satisfaction is negatively related with network exit intentions; however, we do not find statistically significant support (B= -.08; = .176). In support of H1b, we find that franchisee trust in leader strongly reduces network exit intentions (B= -.37, = .000). H1c, proposing a positive effect of franchisee trust in peers on network exit intentions, is supported, but only at the less restrictive 10 percent significance level (B= .12; = .068). The limited direct effects of the three drivers of franchisee network exit intentions (i.e., only trust in franchisor is a strongly significant predictor) already hints at the presence of interaction effects. Regarding the interaction effects of the franchisor’s trust in franchisee, we find a mildly significant interaction effect between economic satisfaction and franchisor’s trust in franchisee (BESxFTE= -.09, = .075). Simple slope analyses reveal a negative relationship between economic satisfaction and network exit intentions for high levels of franchisor’s trust in franchisee (B= -.17, = .073), whereas for low levels of franchisor’s trust there is no significant relationship (B= .01, .910). Figure 2 depicts this interaction effect. This finding provides modest support for H2, which states that the franchisor’s trust in franchisee strengthens the negative relationship between franchisees’ economic satisfaction and their network exit intentions. We find a significant interaction effect between the franchisor’s trust in franchisee and franchisee trust in franchisor; however, it contradicts H3. Instead of strengthening the negative effect of franchisee trust in franchisor on network exit intentions, franchisor’s trust in franchisee attenuates the effect (BFTOxFTE= .15, = .007). Simple slope analyses show that the negative relationship between franchisee trust in franchisor and network exit intentions is stronger (i.e., more negative) for franchisees in which the franchisor has a low level of trust (B= -.52, = .000) than for trusted franchisees (B= -.23, = .034). Figure 3 depicts this interaction effect. As predicted by H4, we find a positive interaction between franchisee economic satisfaction and franchisor’s network control (BESxFNC= .13; = .006). H4 hypothesizes that the franchisor’s network control attenuates the negative relationship between franchisee economic satisfaction and network exit intentions. We find support for H4, as in situations of high network control the negative relationship between economic satisfaction and exit intentions disappears. Simple slope analyses reveal that economic satisfaction reduces network exit intentions for franchisees who perceive low franchisor’s network control (B= -.21, =.007), whereas for franchisees who perceive high franchisor’s network control this relationship is insignificant (B= .05, = .537). Figure 4 depicts this interaction effect. Finally, we find an interaction between the franchisee trust in peers and franchisor’s network control (BFTPxFNC= .13, = .009). As hypothesized in H5, in situations of high franchisor’s network control, we see a positive relationship between franchisee trust in peers and network exit intentions. Simple slope analyses demonstrate a positive relationship between franchisee trust in peers and network exit intentions in situations of high franchisor’s network control (B= .25, = .009), whereas in situations of low franchisor’s network control the relationship is not significant (B= -.02, = .821). Figure 5 shows this interaction plot. Finally, we find – in line with Brower et al. (2009) – that franchisor’s trust in franchisee directly reduces franchisee network exit intentions (B= -.16, =. 019). Next, two control variables significantly impact franchisee network exit intentions; as expected, alternatives have a positive effect on exit intentions (B= .40, p= .000), whereas switching costs (B= -.21, = .002) have a negative effect. -------------------------- Insert Table 2 and Figures 2-5 about here -------------------------- Post-study check: linking exit intention to exit behavior To check our assumption and to assess the predictive validity of exit intentions as a construct, we complemented our data with actual franchisee exit data four years after the initial data collection. This timeframe ensured that each franchisee had the option to leave the network voluntarily and was not restricted by any contractual regulations. Of our 120 respondents, 45 (37.5%) had left the @Home network. Based on data retrieved from the franchisor, we first removed 12 franchisees who left the network involuntarily (i.e., bankruptcy, illness, and the franchisor’s decision to terminate the contract), leaving 33 ‘voluntary exits’ in our cleaned sample. After removing the 12 ‘involuntary exits’, we subjected the remaining 108 respondents to a logistic regression analysis regressing the control variables, independent variables and network exit intentions on actual exit behavior as the binary dependent variable. Network exit intention is the only significant predictor of actual exit behavior (B=2.47 = .000; Nagelkerke’s R = 0.281). We also used Mackinnon and Dwyer’s (1993) approach to assess the mediation effects using a dichotomous dependent variable (exit behavior). The results reveal that the effects of economic satisfaction, franchisee trust in franchisor, switching costs and alternatives on exit behavior are fully or partially mediated by the franchisee network exit intention, and that network exit intentions strongly predict actual network exit behavior. DISCUSSION Our study advances franchising research by developing and testing a SET-based framework to explain why and under what contextual conditions franchisees intend to leave their franchise networks. Below, we discuss our results and highlight the specific implications for theory and practice, and we provide directions for future research. Theoretical Implications The pivotal role of the franchisor’s trust in franchisee. Our findings stress the importance of taking a dyadic perspective to explain franchisee network exit intentions. The franchisor’s trust in each franchisee does not uniformly enhance franchisee valuation of exchange outcomes. While high franchisor’s trust in franchisee strengthens franchisee valuation of economic outcomes and thus strengthens the negative relationship between economic satisfaction and network exit intentions, it – unexpectedly – does not further enhance franchisee valuations of the social outcome of their trust in franchisor. Our result that economic satisfaction only significantly reduces franchisee network exit intentions when franchisor’s trust in franchisee is high indicates that the valuation of franchisee economic benefits crucially depends on the franchisor’s trust. In situations of high franchisor’s trust in franchisee, franchisees receive positive signals and perceive a high-quality relationship with the franchisor, and expect positive outcomes in the future. Such situations create a cooperative setting between franchisees and franchisors and facilitate the recognition and valuation of economic benefits that result from the network exchange. In situations where the franchisor lacks trust in the franchisee, such signals about a positive future and the franchisor’s desire to continue the relationship are absent. This may lead the franchisee to interpret that economic outcomes result from an individual rather than from a collective effort. Our finding empirically confirms the implicit assumption made in other SET and LMX studies that a leader’s trust in member enhances the member’s valuation of exchange outcomes (cf., Brower et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2013). However, opposite to this assumption, we find that franchisees who trust the franchisor derive less value from the franchisor’s trust in them than franchisees who have low trust in the franchisor. Our finding can be explained by the findings of Anand et al. (2010) who show that employees in a high-quality relationship with their leader derive less value from their leader’s signs of appreciation because this appreciation is ‘more of the same’. In a similar vein, franchisees who highly trust their franchisor may perceive a reciprocal trust signal from the franchisor as yet another positive signal in an already valued relationship. At the same time, we find that decreasing levels of a franchisee trust in the franchisor are much more detrimental to the continuance of the relationship when the franchisor lacks trust in the franchisee as compared to when the franchisor has high trust in the franchisee. In such low-trust situations, the relationship may deteriorate quickly via negative trust spirals (Ferrin et al., 2008).The pivotal role of the franchisor’s network control The franchisor’s network control moderates the effects of franchisee exchange outcomes on their network exit intentions, such that it devalues economic outcomes and strengthens the effects of peer trust as a social outcome. A high franchisor’s network control weakens the exit-reducing effect of economic satisfaction, and it enhances the exit-promoting effect of franchisee trust in peers. First, we find that franchisees attach less value to their economic satisfaction under high franchisor’s network control conditions. An explanation is that under high levels of network control, franchisees are more likely to perceive the franchisor’s controlling behaviors as an excessive and obtrusive use of the franchisor’s power (cf., Heide et al., 2007; Sitkin et al., 2020). Higher economic outcomes boost franchisee self-confidence and trigger economically satisfied franchisees to leave their network under high network control situations because such control undermines their autonomy and creates value incongruence with the franchisor (cf. Das & Teng, 2002b; Long & Sitkin, 2018). Second, we find that the marginally positive effect of franchisee trust in peers on their network exit intentions becomes a strongly positive effect when franchisees experience high franchisor’s network control. Two underlying mechanisms can explain why horizontal peer trust and vertical leader control in franchise networks are incompatible. First, as also suggested by research on trust among co-workers (e.g., Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012), peer trust creates a high-quality exchange and forges a stronger bond between parties with similar roles and interests. Such cohesion effects lead to a bundling of power and peer information exchange and learning that reduce the power of the leader. Second, when peers strengthen their relationships and form closely-knit (sub)groups, this automatically affects the relationship each member has with the network leader (cf. Greve et al., 2010). In case of a high franchisor’s network control, an increase in peer trust can lead to ‘social distancing’ between the franchisor and its franchisees because franchisees interpret the franchisor’s control as redundant and undesirable given the low risks that derive from generalized exchanges with highly trusted peers. Franchisees respond to such coercive control by engaging in balancing operations to restore the power balance, which ultimately increases the likelihood of withdrawal or coalition formation. In low network control settings, an increase in franchisee peer trust facilitates the continuation of network membership, as franchisees perceive greater autonomy and feel less compelled to engage in such balancing operations, while at the same time they can benefit from increased peer cooperation and reduced generalized exchange risks that result from withholding of information and deviation from standards by peers (cf. Das & Teng, 2002a; El Akremi et al., 2011). Our findings imply that franchising research should include the role of the franchisor’s network control in explaining franchisee behavioral intentions. Network control reflects an important strategic trade-off for franchisors: on the one hand, network control is needed to secure cooperation and limit franchisee opportunistic behaviors, such that franchisees can achieve economic and/or social outcomes in the long run, but on the other hand, franchisees may perceive network control as redundant and obtrusive as soon as these outcomes are achieved.  The multi-referent nature of franchisee social outcomes.Our analysis shows that trust in franchise networks is a double-edged sword that could foster and limit franchisee network exits. While a franchisee’s trust in the franchisor has a very strong and consistent negative direct effect on exit intentions, we find a marginally positive overall effect of a franchisee’s trust in peers, which increases sharply when the franchisor’s network control is high. Peer trust allows franchisees to learn from each other and help each other (cf., Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012), such that they can increase their confidence to successfully pursue outside options. This suggests that higher peer trust may spur a phenomenon which we refer to as ‘network spawning’: franchisees leave their networks to continue their business without being part of a franchise network because they accumulate enough knowledge and resources to run their business and create value outside the network without sharing the rents with the franchisor. In a post-study check, we find clear evidence of such network spawning: of the 33 @Home franchisees that ultimately left the network voluntarily, 30 (91%) continued their business on their own in the same industry. Several @Home franchisees continued to cooperate (e.g., on joint assignments) with former network peers after exiting. This possibility of social exchange outcomes persisting after leaving a franchise network provides an interesting avenue for future research. Managerial implications  Assuming that franchisors generally want to avoid franchisee network exits, we derive the following managerial implications. First, franchisee trust in franchisor is a major determinant of their network exit intentions, so franchisors should create trust by demonstrating an overall ability and willingness to manage the franchise network. We also show that for franchisors it is a good strategy to keep on demonstrating a positive trusting attitude towards franchisees, because such a trusting stance dampens the adversarial effects of franchisees’ low levels of trust in franchisor. In responding to franchisee failures or opportunistic manifestations, franchisors are advised to take corrective action but stress their continuation of trust in them. Second, franchisors should realize that franchisee trust in peers can develop a countervailing power towards the franchisor as they can learn to collectively imitate the franchisor’s resources and build a new competitive position for themselves outside the network. This probability is especially high when these franchisees feel coerced (rather than enabled) by the franchisor. A final implication relates to the franchisor’s network control since high network control may make franchisees indifferent to positive economic exchange outcomes and it may have network-destabilizing effects for franchisees with high trust in their peers. To avoid such effects, franchisors could reduce franchisee perceived power asymmetry, for example, by granting franchisees more decision rights or autonomy in specific domains (e.g., Dada, 2018), and/or by setting up a franchisee consultation structure (e.g., Grace et al. 2020). Limitations and Further Research While studying a single franchise network allowed us to control for industry and network differences and thus to improve internal validity (Davies et al., 2011), this choice affects the generalizability of our findings. Although we would not expect radically different findings in other franchise network contexts, franchise networks may have specific characteristics (e.g. centralization levels) that influence franchisee exit intentions. Second, future research could go beyond the franchisor’s role and investigate how franchisee characteristics, such as their propensity to trust or their importance attached to reciprocity, shape their valuation of network outcomes and exit intentions. Third, given that franchisee trust in peers strongly promotes their network exit intentions in high franchisor network control situations, research should try to open the ‘black box’ of peer trust and peer cooperation. Future research could build on literature on networking behaviors to better understand trust and social interactions among specific franchisees. Finally, although we could link exit intentions to exit behaviors, our results provide limited insight into the dynamic processes and events ultimately leading to these behaviors. More fine-grained longitudinal data would help to understand how franchisee network exit intentions ultimately translate into exit behaviors and network instability.  \n",

      "A Dynamic Capabilities PerspectiveAbstract\n",
      "A stream of research indicates that dynamic capabilities (DCs) increase the competitive-ness and innovation of companies. Companies need to develop DCs to gain a competitive advantage. According to Wang and Ahmed (2007), DCs encompass the capacities of adaptation, absorption and innovation. This research seeks to understand how franchise networks innovate in terms of innovation capacity and DCs. \n",
      "Franchise networks represent an interesting ground for this analysis because they are sub-ject to dialectics on the role of innovation in maintaining a competitive advantage. This research uses a qualitative methodology involving 24 interviews within 16 French franchise networks. Our results point to two categories of franchise networks. The first one corresponds to networks that are performing well but do not own DCs and the second one corresponds to networks that are performing well and own DCs. Finally, we propose to consider the innovation capacity as a component of DCs according to the model of Wang and Ahmed (2007).\n",

      "INTRODUCTION \n",
      "One line of research stresses that dynamic capabilities (DCs) make it possible to increase the competitiveness and innovation of firms (Teece et al., 1997; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Indeed, firms must develop DCs in order to gain a competitive advantage (Teece et al., 1997; Augier and Teece, 2009). These capabilities are defined here as \"the potential of a firm to systematically solve problems, constituted by its propensity to identify oppor-tunities and threats, to make timely market-oriented decisions, and to change its resource base.\"(Barreto, 2010, p. 271). They involve recurrent, persistent systems and intentionali-ty on the part of companies to identify opportunities in the environment and change their routines (Zollo and Winter, 2002). However, despite the growing number of works on DCs (Vögel and Güttel, 2013), there is a persistent lack of consensus surrounding this concept (Meurier and Gieu, 2014). In particular, the role of innovation capacity in the de-velopment of DCs and the maintenance of a competitive advantage are well debated, es-pecially for firms operating in moderately dynamic environments (Wang and Ahmed, 2007; Peteraf et al., 2013; Breznik and Hisrich, 2014). This debate has substantial opera-tional consequences for organisations operating in relatively predictable environments.\n",
      "The innovation capacity is sometimes considered as a particular type of DC, which may prove to be indispensable in certain sectors of activity. However, according to this conception, companies can create and maintain an advantage by deploying other DCs than the sole capacity for innovation (capacity for rapid decision-making, strategic rene-wal or acquisition). On the contrary, for Wang and Ahmed (2007), the innovation capacity is, along with the capacity for absorption and the capacity for adaptation, an indispen-sable element for the emergence of DCs, which will ultimately allow an advantage in terms of performance for the company. While previous research has highlighted the rela-tionship between DCs and innovation (e.g. Ambrosini, Bowman and Collier, 2009; Helfat et al., 2007; Teece, 2007; Teece et al., 1997), it seems to us essential to understand how franchise networks innovate and maintain a competitive advantage in environments that are characterised by a moderate level of dynamism.\n",
      "Franchising is an important source of entrepreneurial growth involving two different types of entrepreneurs: the franchisor who has identified an opportunity and manages its distribution system and its image in geographically dispersed locations, and franchisees who exploit the opportunity locally (Gillis et al., 2020). This mode of network organisa-tion allows rapid growth thanks to the replication of know-how and the standardisation of the offer and of the processes deployed (Gorovaia, 2017; Windsperger and Gorovaia, 2011). Indeed, high-performance networks are those that are capable of replicating the concept to generate a competitive advantage (Perrigot et al., 2017). While it is generally accepted that know-how is the basis for the creation of a competitive advantage for fran-chises, the mechanisms for maintaining this advantage remain to be defined. In a compe-titive environment, networks need to keep abreast of market developments so that they can react accordingly and reconfigure their resource base (Boulay and Chanut, 2010). DCs thus provide a highly relevant analytical framework for franchising (El Akremi et al., 2015). According to Teece, (2007) DCs operate in high velocity sectors while Eisen-hardt and Martin (2000) suggest that DCs can also be mobilized in more stable environ-ments. Similarly, the links between DCs and innovation capacity remain to be established in franchising arrangements. However, this context of franchising is subject to dialectics on the role of innovation in maintaining competitive advantage (Szulanski and Jensen, 2006; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001) and is particularly relevant for understanding how franchise networks innovate and the role of innovation capacity in DCs. \n",
      "To answer this question, we conducted 24 interviews (19 franchisors and 5 franchisees) within 16 French franchise networks. Our results highlight two categories of networks: a first category of networks that offer quality performance but do not own DCs and a se-cond category of networks that offer quality performance and own DCs. Similarly, we provide an in-depth overview of DCs with regard to their innovation capacity.\n",
      "This work is structured in four parts. The first part sheds light on the literature review, the second part presents the research methodology, the third part presents the results and the fourth part consists of discussing the results obtained.\n",
      "1. THE DCs APPROACH1.1 THE NATURE OF DCThe concept of DCs has attracted widespread attention from management science researchers in recent years (Barreto, 2010). The starting point of this theory is as follows: if a company wishes to maintain a competitive advantage, it should not only be able to exploit resources that it possesses in-house, or can mobilize externally, but should also develop new skills that will enable it to adapt to and benefit from changes in the environment (Depeyre and Mirc, 2007). The studies then identified DCs as capabilities that enable companies to match their in-house resources and skills with the external environment. Thus, the pioneering work of Teece et al, (1997) and Teece (2007, 2009), emphasizes that DCs aim to identify opportunities by scanning, researching and exploring technologies and markets to respond to the rapid evolutions of the environment. They are also associated with the organisation's ability to intentionally create, expand or modify its resource base (Helfat et al., 2007; Teece et al., 1997). As the definition of DCs does not reach consensus, it is necessary to explicitly specify the chosen design in order to remove any ambiguity and to distinguish them from related concepts (Schilke et al., 2018). Thus, we follow the perspective of Barreto (2010) and consider DCs as embedded elements in structured and recurrent processes that are therefore different from ad hoc problem solving (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007). We also note that these elements must be stable (Zollo and Winter, 2002) and must enable the organisation to make decisions before their competitors (Barreto, 2010). These must lead to value creation for customers by reconfiguring the organisation's resource and skill base (Teece and Pisano, 1994; Tripsas 1997; Augier and Teeece, 2008; Adner and Helfat, 2003). DCs need to be differentiated from ordinary capacities that aim to ensure the operational efficiency of the organisation since they aim to facilitate strategic change and occur at the organisational level (Laaksonen and Peltoniemi, 2018). There is a growing body of research highlighting the characteristics of DCs in specific industries; however, there is too little research available to understand the commonalities of DCs in different industries (Wang and Ahmed, 2007). Moreover, research also focusing on DCs in non-technology sectors is sparse (Easterby-Smith et al., 2009). The following sections therefore aim to highlight the debates on DCs in moderately dynamic environments and present the model of Wang and Ahmed (2007) selected for this research.\n",
      "1.2 THE WANG AND AHMED MODEL (2007)\n",
      "DCs have been particularly studied in dynamic environments (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011). However, their nature and impact differ according to the level of dynamism of the environment (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Thus, moderately dynamic environments are characterised by more predictable changes than highly dynamic environments and by more linear strategic trajectories with more stable industrial structures. Some studies have suggested that DCs have a lower impact on maintaining competitive advantage for firms in more stable contexts. Thus, in this type of environment, managers rarely perceive the need to reconfigure their resource base and to acquire new skills; they therefore mobilise DCs less often (Ambrosini, Bowman and Collier, 2009). However, the findings are more mixed. Thus, Wilden and Gudergan (2015) show that while reconfiguring the resource base can bring benefits to companies in stable environments, the costs associated with constant environmental analysis outweigh the benefits associated with the information thus collected in such contexts. Hence, while DCs can enable companies to seize oppor-tunities in new and potentially effective ways, they do not guarantee the success or survi-val of the organisation (Zahra et al., 2006). Indeed, these capacities are necessary but not sufficient to maintain a competitive advantage. They thus create value but in an indirect way (Zahra et al., 2006; Helfat and Peteraf, 2003), i.e. DCs \"do not involve the produc-tion of a good or the provision of a marketable service\" (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003, p.999). Therefore, it is necessary to achieve capacity development that provides an advantage to the organisation in the context in which it operates (Zahra et al., 2006).\n",
      "In particular, Wang and Ahmed (2007) identify three components that would be common to DCs in an untested theoretical model: \n",
      "-the capacity to adapt, which enables the company to identify and capitalise on new op-portunities by making a flexible use of resources; \n",
      "-the absorption capacity which consists in defining the value of external information and assimilating it;\n",
      "-the innovation capacity that enables the development of new products, services or pro-cesses. \n",
      "According to the authors, these three dimensions are connected and underpinned by pro-cesses of integration, reconfiguration, renewal and re-creation. This model, strongly ins-pired by Teece's definition, is meant to be integrative and the 3 capacities mentioned above would be valid whatever the context in which the organisation operates. However, we may question the role of the innovation capacity in relatively stable environments such as franchising. Indeed, in this type of environment, the benefits of replicating, on a large scale a know-how, resulting from the company's experience and therefore perfectly mastered, may be greater than those generated by the launch of new products or services (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Similarly, according to the study carried out by Wilden and Gudergan (2015), the effects of absorption capacity may be limited in stable envi-ronments. Another perspective, though presenting similarities, is included in the synthesis model of Schilke et al (2018). Thus, the capacity to develop new products and services is presented as being a particular dimension (among others) of DCs. This dimension is the most studied one by researchers. This implies, as in the perspective of Eisenhardt and Martin (2000), that companies could develop other types of DCs in order to perform well. These different approaches to DCs lead us to wonder about the role of innovation capaci-ty as defined by Wang and Ahmed (2007) in the DCs of franchise networks. The follo-wing sections shed light on the specificities of the franchise model and of DCs in franchi-sing.\n",
      "2. THE FRANCHISE \n",
      "2.1. THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE FRANCHISE MODEL Franchising is an organisational form that binds the franchisor (owner of a brand) and the franchisees (independent entrepreneurs) by contract. This organizational form allows the franchisee to sell the franchisor's products or services, while nonetheless respecting the franchisor's standards (Cox & Mason, 2009). Franchise networks thus develop through the replication of a concept and through outlets offering standardized products and/or services (Gorovaia, 2017). Two elements are pivotal in the creation of competitive advan-tages in franchising: the know-how that must bring value to the franchisees and be clearly identified and kept secret, and the quality of the relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee - based on a close and continuous collaboration, characterised by trust (Perrigot et al., 2017).\n",
      "Thus, according to Paswan and Wittmann (2009), the attractiveness of the network is ba-sed on the quality of the know-how developed by the franchisor. The franchisor, through his previous experience, develops a set of methods, uses and practical information that may concern the sale of products, their presentation or transformation, the reception of customers or the management of the point of sale. This knowledge, which is explicitly set out in the franchise contract, constitutes know-how and is a substantial factor in the suc-cess of the franchise. The franchisor must maintain and transfer this body of knowledge to its sub-units (Argote, 1999; Szulanski et al., 2003). According to Easterby-Smith and Lyles (2003), knowledge transfer in business networks is essential, especially for sharing know-how among network members. The success of networks depends almost entirely on the transfer of know-how from the franchisor to the franchisees (Windsperger and Goro-vaia, 2011). Indeed, successful networks are those that can ensure the replication of the concept to generate a competitive advantage (Perrigot et al., 2017).\n",
      "2.2. CDS IN FRANCHISE NETWORKS \n",
      "To our knowledge, the studies involving DCs and franchising have focused on performance (El Akremi et al., 2015) or on the role of the franchisor in network development (Weigel, 2020), but have not yet explored how franchise networks innovate.According to El Akremi et al, (2015) it is relevant to study DCs in the case of franchising because franchisors regularly create new skills or knowledge within the network in order to renew know-how. In a competitive environment, the network must effectively keep abreast of market developments in order to be able to react accordingly (Boulay and Cha-nut, 2010). This capacity refers to the propensity of the chain to use and redeploy re-sources to formulate and implement the best strategy to respond to market needs and out-perform competitors (Gillis and Combs, 2009; Griffith, Noble and Chen, 2006). Despite the scarcity of work on DCs in franchise networks, the literature on change and innova-tion in franchise networks indicates that the development of DCs in franchise networks would respond to a number of specificities:\n",
      "-First of all, the sectors represented in the franchise mainly concern personal or business services, restaurants, hotels, household equipment or the automobile sector. These dif-ferent fields are characterised by relatively predictable changes, a low presence of break-through innovations and well-identified market players. They can therefore be characteri-sed as being moderately dynamic;\n",
      "-Next, the know-how developed must be disseminated to all the entities in the network (Perrigot et al., 2017). Thus, the elements embedded in the processes and which make up the DCs must allow this uniform dissemination within the network;\n",
      "-The renewal, recreation, integration and reconfiguration of the resources and skills that underpin DCs can occur at both the franchisee and franchisor levels (Cox and Mason, 2007). For example, recent research shows that franchisees generate new knowledge that can lead to the launch of new offerings or processes (Dada and Watson, 2013). Franchise networks can thus develop DC-related processes both at the franchisee level, at the fran-chise head level and in the franchisee-franchisor relationship ;\n",
      "-Finally, reconfiguration and renewal of the knowledge and resource bases requires more investment in franchise networks than in traditional businesses and may be the subject of fierce resistance on the part of franchisees (Cliquet and Nguyen, 2004). Thus, since fran-chisees own their business, they must be convinced of the need for these renewals so that they will adopt them in their outlets (Ibid). The compromise between retaining the status quo in the face of the transformations of the environment and not mobilizing DCs, trans-forming the resources and skills in the network and assuming the cost of this transforma-tion is thus commonly done in franchising.\n",
      "In the literature review, we have shown the relevance of applying an analytical frame-work to DCs for franchise networks. We have also been able to demonstrate that while DCs in this context share a number of characteristics with DCs in moderately dynamic environments, there are, nevertheless, specificities. We therefore wish to conduct an ex-ploratory empirical study to specify these differences and to deepen the reflection on the particular role of innovation capacity in DCs for franchise networks. Indeed, if the ab-sorption capacity (the acquisition of knowledge from different sources) seems to be at the heart of the competitive advantage in franchising (Paswan et al., 2014), research provides more mixed results regarding the capacity for innovation and adaptation (Khelil et al., 2020; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Thus, too frequent innovations and uncontrolled local adaptations can harm the performance of the network. We therefore conducted a qualitative study among 16 French franchise networks. \n",
      "3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n",
      "3.1. DATA COLLECTION\n",
      "To achieve this aim, we interviewed representatives of several franchise networks belon-ging to different sectors that we characterise as moderately dynamic. We have chosen a diversity of cases and representations from different sectors of activity in order to be able to bring out common elements concerning the nature of DCs in franchise networks. Our research method is centred on the comparative studies of 16 franchise networks. A brief description of the cases can be consulted in the appendix. Table 1 lists the characteristics of the networks studied in terms of size and sector of activity.\n",

Press releases and articles in the specialised press are therefore nu-merous and provide rich information on the network's trajectory in terms of performance and innovation. We have thus consulted the annual reports of the networks, the articles in the press specialised in franchising such as L'express, Franchise Magazine, the Franchise Observatory, Toute la franchise, AC Franchise, Franchise commerce, Les Echos de la Franchise, Place des franchises, the official website of the French Franchise Federation or even LSA-conso. We have also taken into consideration information from the websites of the selected franchise networks as well as articles from specialised sites on the network sector. We thus also have data concerning the dynamism of the different networks' sectors of activity and can compare the growth of the franchise with that of its sector of activity, in particular to evaluate the maintenance (or not) of a competitive advantage. The pre-sence of certain networks in the press concerning changes in strategy or the deployment of new products/services or even awards for innovation are all elements that have enabled us to apprehend the level of dynamism of the network as well as its capacity for innova-tion. A total of 60 secondary data sources were used.\n",
      "In order to understand the nature of DCs in the different networks, 24 semi-directive in-terviews were conducted with franchisors and franchisees. The average length of the in-terviews was 35 minutes. We wished to incorporate both points of view, where possible, in order to be able to cross-check the data. Regarding the interviews with the network heads, we essentially interviewed the franchise directors or those responsible for its deve-lopment. The semi-directive interviews dealt with products/services recently introduced in the network. A discussion then took place on the changes made to the network for the design of the new product or service, such as the recruitment of a new person or the tes-ting of new machines. To be more precise, we asked the franchisor about the origin of the new product/service (customer demand, marketing idea), up to its diffusion in the net-work, including the changes necessary for the implementation of the new product/service. Due to the complexity of the object, the term \"dynamic capability\" was never used during the interviews. The objective of the interviews is to retrace the path of the innovation from the beginning to the end result obtained (implementation throughout the network or failure). It is therefore necessary to retrace the entire process in order to be able to deter-mine whether or not DCs are present. These interviews took place face-to-face or by tele-phone when a physical meeting was impossible, notably for geographical reasons or, re-cently, for health reasons (corona virus).\n",
      "3.2. DATA ANALYSIS \n",
      "We first sought to determine whether the selected networks were able to maintain a com-petitive advantage. To this end, we cross-referenced several data, including network growth in terms of franchised units from 2017 to 2019, growth in network revenue, and the number of awards or press releases issued by the trade press praising the performance of a given network over the period in question. We were thus able to distinguish between networks that do not appear to be maintaining their competitive advantage (networks with decreasing figures not justified by the industry's loss of momentum) and networks that are maintaining or increasing their competitive advantage. \n",
      "For each network, we then identified whether DCs were evident. According to Altintas (2011), DCs can be identified using the following criteria:\n",
      "-Recurrence (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007) which allows us to underline the repetitive nature of the phenomenon and to differentiate it from improvisation or ad hoc problem solving. Thus the fact that a process is repeated twice is sufficient to identify a DC (Altintas, 2011).\n",
      "-The stability of the process (Zollo and Winter, 2002). We consider the process to be stable when the new product/service is available for sale in all the units in the network to the clients of the network, thus reflecting a transfer from the franchisor to each franchised unit, which will then offer the new product/service to its clients. \n",
      "-The link between process implementations (Pablo et al., 2007). At this point, it might be possible to observe the different links when the process induces changes and that these same changes are interrelated due to path dependency (Altintas, 2011).\n",
      "-The modification of resources (Teece et al.1997; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). The new product/service provided by the network will have to lead to a change in its re-sources, such as the purchase of a new machine for example.\n",
      "We therefore consider that we are in the presence of a DC when the above-mentioned cri-teria are met.\n",
      "We then crossed the two criteria: presence or not of DCs and maintenance or not of a competitive advantage. \n",
      "Next, we determined whether the network has a capacity for innovation, absorption or adaptation using the definitions presented in Table 2.\n",

      "The comparison of the cases and the related contexts led us to the results described be-low.\n",
      "4. RESULTS \n",

The first category corresponds to networks that have a competitive advantage but no DCs; and the second category cor-responds to networks that have a competitive advantage and DCs.

First of all, we characterise the capacities of adaptation, ab-sorption and innovation in networks that have a competitive advantage but no DCs. Then we will compare networks with competitive advantage and DCs. \n",
      "All the networks in our sample, even those without DCs, are adaptable. The adaptive ca-pacity notably allows them to seize market opportunities. This adaptability can manifest itself in different forms (in both categories). In our first example, network 11 is a network of personal services. More specifically, it enables professionals and individuals to obtain medical equipment. The franchisees are a real source of information for the franchisors, as they do not hesitate to bring their ideas forward. In the following verbatim, the fran-chisees asked the franchisor to set up a Drive, a technique already used in mass distribu-tion. The franchisees wanted to adapt this Drive technique to their own business so that NO CDS AND HIGH PERFOR-MANCEPRESENCE OF DCS AND PER-FORMANCENetwork 11\n",

      "\"It came from all the franchisees, they had it in mind (...) I found myself setting up a Drive service (...) and then it has to be said that health professionals are a very specific target and don't have much time, so it was particularly adapted to this target\" (Network Franchisor 11 ). \n",
      "Adaptability can also manifest itself in other ways, such as market research. A network in the food sector carried out a market study to reorient its strategy. Thanks to this market study, the network decided to move up-market.\n",
      "\"In market research, the customers finally refused to buy among mid-brand ranges, they still refuse (...) The answer of the *** brand was to go up in range, in quality, we went up in quality, we gave priority to *** so there are products that have been removed (...)\" (Network Franchisor 5).\n",
      "The ability to adapt also makes it possible to adapt the range of products provided by the network. Just to build on the example of the food sector network, the ability to adapt al-lows the franchisor to integrate the local ideas of its franchisees into the entire network. In our example, a franchisee located in Alsace wished to sell pretzels to its customers, which is a regional product that has until now not been made available for sale by the network. Following a discussion between the franchisor and this same franchisee, the network decided to support the franchisee in creating its pretzel, which is now available in the entire network in France but also in the international units of the network. \n",
      "\"For the pretzel it was one of our franchisees in the East of France who said they would like to make pretzels and it was the network leader once (...) they had determined a re-cipe, it came back to us internally and in a very collegial way the R&D worked to deve-lop a recipe, to finalise it, they then worked with the finance department to be able to eva-luate a potential profitability on this recipe and it was proposed to our franchisee\" (Net-work Franchisor 5).\n",
      "As far as high-performance networks that do not have DCs are concerned, it is possible to note the absence of absorption capacity. Absorption capacity consists in defining the val-ue of external information and assimilating it. However, the absence of this absorption capacity does not prevent the network from being efficient. Performance was assessed by the joint increase in the number of units in the network and its turnover. For example, Network 12, an automatic car wash network, already has the in-house expertise to devel-op new high-pressure washing technologies. Consequently, the resources held by the network are sufficient and do not require the search for new skills. \n",
      "\"We have teams, in fact, in R&D; moreover, we are filing patents on washing solutions\" (Network Franchisor 12).The ability to innovate enables the development of new products, services or processes. It is therefore wise to ask how these networks can be efficient without developing a capaci-ty for innovation, or even DCs. \n",
      "One possible answer lies in the strategy of the network itself. Network 13 is a franchise offering meal delivery to the elderly. Not innovating is an integral part of its strategy be-cause of the network's target: older people. Indeed, this clientele does not appreciate change. Therefore, the network makes as few changes as possible and the offer evolves rather in a generational way. \n",
      "\"For the elderly target, apart from the change from one generation to the next, we can't make more change than that because in addition, the elderly people, intrinsically don't like change too much … So it takes a bit of change so that people don't get bored but not too much either because it destabilises them\" (Network Franchisor 13).Nevertheless, the network is performing well, with its total sale increasing between 2017 and 2019 (revenue of €20 million in 2017 versus €30 million in 2019). Similarly, it is operating in a sector with 25% annual growth. Network 12 in our sample is an interesting case because it is the only performing network without DCs to have a capacity for innovation. The presence of an R&D department demonstrates the network's strong interest in innovation and requires major efforts on its part to offer more efficient services. However, our secondary data show that this network releases about one innovation every ten years. This is why we cannot speak of DCs but rather of an ad hoc innovation capacity. By ad hoc innovation we mean franchise net-works that innovate infrequently, and are therefore not subject to repetitive behaviour as DCs require. We therefore consider that a network that innovates in an ad hoc way will only occasionally propose new products to its customers. \n",
      "This capacity for innovation is nevertheless sufficient to guarantee the growth and dura-bility of the network since it received the \"Coup de coeur de la franchise: pérennité et croissance maîtrisée\" prize awarded by the Express and the Franchise Observatory. 4.2 NETWORKS WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DCS\n",
      "In this section we compare adaptation, innovation and absorption DCs in networks with DCs and networks without DCs.According to Wang and Ahmed (2007), DCs consist of three elements. The adaptive ca-pacity, the absorptive capacity and the innovative capacity that we have already detailed above.\n",
      "Networks with a competitive advantage and DCs effectively hold these three capacities. According to our sample, these three capacities are connected to each other. The capacity to adapt triggers the franchisor's absorption capacity and the capacity to innovate seems to be the result of the mobilisation of these two capacities with the production of a new product or service from the network. Network 1 is a network in the home and leisure sec-tor. More precisely, it is a network dedicated to pets but more particularly to cats and dogs. This network is particularly proactive in the search for new opportunities in its en-vironment. The franchisor monitors international markets in order to perceive emerging market trends. Thanks to this monitoring, he has observed that customers want more na-tural products and above all products that better correspond to the real needs of their pets. These products are grain free products, i.e. without cereals, which are in fact not adapted for dogs but are nevertheless used in many food products (adaptability). The franchisor then decides to look for a new supplier who can supply products that are grain free (ab-sorption capacity). After such research, the network succeeded in developing not only several products but also several brands of grain free products. The creation of these pro-ducts and brands represents the capacity for innovation, which is none other than the re-sult of the mobilisation of the two previous capacities (capacity for adaptation and ab-sorption). We illustrate this connection using the verbatims in the table below showing the example of network 1.\n",
      "Table 4: Verbatims of the adaptation, absorption and innovation capacities of net-work 1\n",
      "M O B I L I Z E D CAPACITIESVERBATIMSAdaptability\"We realised that, by looking a little bit at the other markets, from the European markets to the American market, that there was a trend towards natural products and products that better meet the nutritional needs of dogs - what we call grain-free products, otherwise known as grain free\"Absorption capacity\"So we looked for a new supplier firstCapacity for innovation  \"So in fact today we must have… how many brands do we have today, 2,3,4,5,6...13Now that the connection between the three capacities is highlighted, they will be discus-sed further in the following paragraphs. \n",
      "As is the case with the networks in the previous category, adaptive capacity can manifest itself in a number of ways, including those presented above. However, we observe that networks with DCs have a proactive vision of their environment unlike those that do not hold such DCs. They are aware of the global market, of the customers’ needs or of market competition. For these purposes, the franchisor can for example, observe the evolution of the environment by listening to its customers. He can also take part in international trade fairs, allowing the franchisor to see what's new on the market. The franchisor can also develop a permanent presence in the field, which enables him to stay as close as possible to the reality of the franchisees and also allows him to collect feedback from franchisees and even from customers during visits. Most of the time the franchisees deal with the network managers rather than with the management of the franchise itself. These examples are illustrated by the verbatims in Table 5. \n",
      "Table 5: Verbatims about the adaptability of the franchisors surveyedFRANCHISE NETWORK VERBATIMSNetwork 7 \"The vegan market, as we saw on TV, yes, we also saw it on shop shelves; yes, there are customers at a given time, good, searching for something more natural, so we thought we'd create a vegan range\"We note that the capacity to adapt in networks holding a competitive advantage and DCs is more mobilised by franchisors, who have a proactive vision of their environment, whereas it is mainly mobilised by franchisees for networks that do not hold DCs. This proactivity can notably be seen in the systematic visits to the units, as demonstrated by the versatility of network 9 (table 5). In our example of network 11 (which has a compe-titive advantage but no DCs), we believe that the capacity to adapt is mainly mobilized by the franchisees because this network has the particularity of only owning franchised units, i.e. the network has no units of its own. We therefore consider that this network relies essentially on the franchisees of the network to detect market opportunities. \n",
      "A difference between the two categories of networks lies in their absorption capacity. In fact, networks that do not have this capacity do not develop DCs either, even if they can be efficient as we mentioned earlier. \n",
      "Absorption capacity, just like adaptability, can manifest itself in many ways. \n",

On the basis of the customers’ feedback, the network began considering it and then looked for solutions to implement the same service in a more natural way. \n",
      "In order to provide this service, network 9 then mobilised its absorption capacity so as to gather new knowledge to carry out the service: \n",
      "\"They found a manufacturer in Spain and a machine that made ozone (...) We underwent the classic process, we bought the machine, we tested several types of machines, etc.(Network Franchisor 13).\n",
      "Absorption capacity can also be demonstrated by hiring staff with the knowledge re-quired to develop a new product or service. \n",
      "Network 10, in the field of temporary agency work, wanted to provide a \"comprehensive offer\". This global offer consists of physical support in the agency and of an internet plat-form on which the agency's clients can themselves recruit their temporary workers by having access to a CV database. The implementation of this global offer and in particular the setting up of this internet platform required new knowledge as indicated in the follow-ing verbatim: \n",
      "\"It's an internal revolution since we've hired about thirty people, including a dozen IT developers with a very start-up like structure. I think we came across three or four solu-tions that we evaluated, tested; we tested in particular two of them to see how it could work, how it worked and whether it was simple or not. \"(Network Franchisor 10).We can therefore see that in both cases the network mobilised its absorption capacity to search for solutions outside the network and then integrated this information into the network, whether by looking for manufacturers or by hiring new employees. \n",
      "As with the adaptability of high-performance networks with DCs, the absorption capacity is once again at the origin of the franchisor who will take the steps to acquire new ma-chines in the case of nnetwork 9 or start a recruitment process in the case of network 10.\n",
      "A second difference between our two categories of networks lies in the capacity for inno-vation. Successful networks and DC holders have the capacity for innovation. It simply manifests itself by the creation of new products or services by the network. \n",

      "We note that the capacity for innovation is mostly developed by networks with a competi-tive advantage and DCs, because a single network without DCs but with a competitive advantage also develops a capacity for innovation. The lack of absorption capacity in networks with a competitive advantage but without DCs prevents them from developing a capacity for innovation. As mentioned above, several factors such as the sector or the presence of internal knowledge can explain this lack of absorption capacity. \n",
      "We can therefore think that the combination of the adaptive and absorptive capacities favours the development of the innovation capacity. The addition of new knowledge to the network actually allows the network to develop new products/services. \n",
      "5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n",
      "One of the questions addressed in the research was to determine the nature of DCs with regard to the capacity for innovation by mobilising the approach of Wang and Ahmed (2007). Several perspectives are in confrontation with regard to their nature. While some think that innovation capacity and DCs are synonymous, others such as Wang and Ahmed, (2007) suggest that innovation capacity is a component of DC. Indeed, Parashar and Singh, (2005) argue that the innovative capacity relies on DCs in particular because they facilitate the ability to adapt to change through innovation (Hill and Rothaermel, 2003). Wang and Ahmed, (2007) consider that DCs consist of adaptive capacity, absorp-tive capacity and innovation capacity. Our results show that the networks in our sample with competitive advantage and DCs also have a capacity for innovation as well as the ability to adapt and absorb. We can the-refore think that innovative capacity is, as Wang and Ahmed, (2007) suggest, a com-ponent of DCs. On the other hand, we consider that innovation capacity and DCs are not synonymous since our results show that one of the networks in our sample has the capaci-ty to innovate without developing DCs. Moreover, these same authors suggest that the capacities of adaptation, absorption and innovation that make up DCs are connected. Our results also point in this direction. Indeed, according to our results, the adaptive capacity triggers the absorption capacity of the franchisor and the innovation capacity seems to be the result of the mobilization of these two capacities with the production of a new product or a new service of the network. Our research also shows that it is possible for franchise networks to perform well over the long term without owning DCs. This result is in line with the literature on the ambiguous relationship between DCs and competitive advantage (Chaharmahali and Siadat, 2010; Krzakiewicz, 2013). While some works such as those of Teece et al, (1997) and Augier and Teece, (2009) suggest that DCs lead to competitive advantage, our results show that DCs are not always necessary to obtain it. In fact, several networks in our sample do not own DCs, and yet they perform well. This can be explained in particular by the adaptabil-ity developed by these networks, which is based on close relationships between the fran-chisor and the franchisees. As Cox and Mason suggest, (2007) franchisees are indeed a source of ideas for the network through their interactions with local customers. Moreover, the relationship between the franchisor and its franchisees plays a particular role in pro-moting the dissemination of innovations within the network and encouraging franchisees to adopt new products (Cliquet and Nguyen, 2004). The franchisor cannot impose new innovations on its franchisees. The franchisor must then convince rather than coerce (Al-lix-Desfautaux et al., 2014). It is therefore essential for the franchisor to maintain quality relationships with its franchisees, particularly because franchisees may be reluctant to adopt certain innovations, especially when they are initiated by the franchisor (Ibid.). This leads us to discuss our findings on the absorption capacity of franchise networks. \n",
      "Absorption capacity only appears in our second category of networks, i.e. networks with a competitive advantage and DCs. Our results highlight the importance of absorption ca-pacity in franchise networks. Indeed, it takes a lot of effort on the part of the franchisor to disseminate the new product or service throughout the entire network due to the geo-graphical disparities that may exist. Indeed, the mobilisation of the absorption capacity by the franchisor alone is not sufficient to ensure the durability of the network. The fran-chisor must ensure that the absorbed knowledge is passed on to all its franchisees, despite the geographical disparities, with the aim of offering a standardised product or service to customers. To do so, the franchisor can rely on various means such as training, annual meetings or regional meetings. Allix-Desfautaux et al, (2014) note that training is an ef-fective way to overcome the resistance of some franchisees. \n",
      "Our findings are consistent with the discussions stating that DCs can, however, foster competitive advantage (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016). Indeed, we believe that DCs promote competitive advantage, particularly because networks that have a competitive advantage and DCs develop more absorptive and inno-vative capacities than networks that do not hold any. Therefore we believe that the inno-vation capacity is the result of the mobilization of adaptive and absorptive capacities.\n",

Exploring leadership gender and risk taking in franchise firms. Abstract Drawing on the previous literature, we suggest that male leaders make risky decisions to a greater extent than female leaders in the context of the Spanish franchise. We test for these gender differences in the real context of franchise systems and analyse the interaction between gender and other observable factors through univariate analyses. We used the chain discontinuation rate for a three-year period (2015-2017) to directly analyse how the franchisors leaders behave in terms of risk. Our results are in line with what is suggested by the large body of literature that states that women are more risk averse than men. In addition, we found interesting contexts where these gender differences do not hold true. In particular, we find that male and female leaders seem to operate with the same level of risk-taking behavior in the B2B as opposed to the B2C sector and in large firms as opposed to small firms. Theoretically, we posit this may be a function of two possible routes: first that women leaders take less risks in B2C sectors as they seek act on behalf of customers they represent and second that increased social pressure that male and female leaders may experience within large firm settings to operate in line with norms when it comes to risk taking: which may decrease risk-taking in male leaders and increase risk-taking in female leaders. Finally, our exploration of risk taking suggested that both male and female leaders will take more risks as they gain more experience as leaders, suggesting that risk-taking may be an important skill that is learned in leadership. This study contributes to the field of strategic decisions, risk in senior leadership, and the literature on franchises and gender, and formulates interesting future lines of research related to risk in franchises. Key words: Risk; discontinuation rate; gender differences; franchise; leadership. LITERATURE REVIEW Gender differences in risk management The fine line that separates success from failure in business is largely determined by proper risk management and the ability to optimally balance organizational and financial decisions. There is broad agreement on the difference in risk behaviours between men and women. This gender gap in financial decision making tends to tip the balance toward risk- taking for men and aversion for women. This assumption has been corroborated by the literature from different disciplines and theoretical approaches (Byrnes et al., 1999; Borghans et al., 2009; Croson & Gneezy, 2009; Charness & Gneezy, 2012; Zhu et al., 2021). Arguments from the biological area of human behaviour attribute these differences in risk management to hormonal origins. For example, Cronqvist et al., (2016) found that a greater presence of prenatal testosterone is related to the masculinization of financial behaviour, which affects the assumption of risk in decision making during adulthood. This is in line with studies that have shown that a greater presence of testosterone increases the chances of experiencing risky behaviours in the management of financial affairs (Cueva et al., 2015; Apicella et al., 2014; Chicaiza-Becerra & Garcia-Molina, 2017). When examining a sample of 98 men, Apicella et al., (2008) found that risk-taking is positively correlated with saliva testosterone levels and facial masculinity. Specifically, they found that men with higher levels of testosterone invested almost 12% more of their portfolio in a financial game than men with average levels of testosterone. These results are maintained in the study by Nofsinger et al., (2018) who show that within a competitive environment, high levels of testosterone imply a greater assumption of risk compared to a non-competitive environment. Making optimal economic decisions is a necessary action to achieve wealth, and therefore, high social status as well. Testosterone works in individuals as a facilitator to achieve that economic status by favouring risk taking, which increases the chances of obtaining greater wealth (Stanton, 2017). Thereby, hormone levels function as adaptive survival mechanisms within the business context by significantly influencing the cognitive processes that affect financial decision making (Coates et al., 2010). In relation to cognitive processes, in the area of psychology, there are numerous theoretical approaches that offer alternative explanations about the differences that men and women present in risk assessment. Within the cognitive psychology literature, several investigations have evidenced the influence of positive and negative affects on risk-taking (Mano, 1992, 1994; Lawton et al., 2007; Delgado-García et al., 2010; Janssen et al., 2010; al., 2018). Whilst positive affects influence the perception of reality in an optimistic way, negative affects tend to draw a less idealized and more pessimistic reality, focusing on loss rather than gain. As a result of this cognitive process, individuals tend to select the riskiest decision when positive affects predominate, and, on the contrary, when negative affects prevail (Delgado-García et al., 2010). Jacobsen et al., (2014), using data from large surveys, find that men are more oriented towards optimistic thinking about the future performance of the stock market; whilst women present a higher degree of pessimism and perception of risk. Furthermore, these results are maintained after taking into account sociodemographic variables such as income level, education or country of origin. These results are in line with the findings of Dominitz & Manski (2007), who observed that men present more optimistic beliefs than women regarding the returns of stocks in the following year. In line with this approach, the literature on behavioural finance delves into the deviations from perceptions based on rational models (Rajdev & Raninga, 2016). These deviations in perception are known as cognitive biases. Cognitive biases have been defined by Simon et al., (2000, p. 113) as: “common types of mental shortcuts used to make judgments”. These authors point to three types of cognitive biases that may influence underestimation of risk: overconfidence, the illusion of control, and belief in the law of small numbers. This last bias manifests itself when decisions are made based on limited information. One of the main conclusions from this study is that the cognitive processes that encourage individuals to start a business are the same ones that influence their poor performance. Hence, these cognitive bias are also associated with business failure. This is closely related to the negative consequences of risky decisions; which women tend to focus on when evaluating the gain-loss relationship (Beckmann et al., 2011). In an analysis of the literature on behavioural finance Rajdev & Raninga (2016) find that there are different behavioural biases that are related to personality traits and gender psychology. Whilst male investors suffer from an overconfidence bias and tend to think that they are more competent than women, female investors suffer from herding, hindsight and anchoring bias. These biases are often enhanced by certain personality traits. In the case of women, empathy, socialization and extraversion influence their orientation to imitate the behaviours of others instead of taking certain risks when making financial decisions. On the other hand, the combination of cognitive psychology with neuroscience offers a useful theoretical approach to understand human behaviour in terms of risk management. Slovic et al., (2004) suggest that the rational system is based on formal logic, whilst the experiential system is based on intuition and association. According to the authors, both of them work in parallel, depending on each other. This means that assumption and aversion to risk obey the interrelation between emotion and reason, which, as the authors point out, is the key of the rational behaviour. Gender differences in franchise risk Although the gender gap on economic risk has been repeatedly evidenced in the financial context through the study of preferences and perceptions (see for example, Finucane et al., 2000; Dohmen et al., 2011; Almenberg & Dreber, 2015), it is not so evident a priory that this behaviour pattern is replicated to the same extent in the real context of companies (Brooks et al., 2019). To provide evidence in this regard, it is convenient to analyse a real context where risk can be directly observed through the decisions made by higher-level leaders. In this study we propose to study risk in the context of the franchise since it presents adequate analytical conditions to evaluate leadership decisions at the chain level. Some of the main characteristics of the franchise such as the highly competitive context, the homogeneity in organizational terms and the breadth of the market and client portfolio; make the franchise model an ideal scenario for the analysis of strategic decisions faced by leading franchisors in terms of risk. The studies that have tackled the risk in franchising, mainly focus on the role of franchisee leaders and the factors that influence the perception of risk. For example, Grace & Weaven (2011) find that the risk assessment and satisfaction of franchisees are determined by perceptions of emotional and monetary value. In the case of women, a higher perception of monetary value is associated with a lower perception of risk. In line with the perceptions of the leaders, Meek et al., (2014) find that the levels of trust in the franchisor-franchisee relationship differ between genders. Specifically, they observe that women have a lower level of trust in franchisees than men, which, according to the authors, might be related to their tendency to aversion to risk. In a recent study, Thaichon et al., (2020) point out that certain factors such as the balance between work and family life and the characteristics of the franchise sector, among others, influence the selection of the franchise business model by part of the franchised women. This decision is determined by the different levels at which women are willing to take risk. Whilst there is some evidence on the factors that may influence risk perception among franchise leaders; it is less clear how franchise leaders behave in terms of risks in the real context. Based on the above discussion, it makes sense to argue that male franchisors are geared towards taking more risk than female franchisors. Nevertheless, in this study we go one step further by assessing the factors that can skew risk decisions among male leaders. Determinants in the risk assumption of male franchisors Drawing on the literature on organizational behaviour, we identified four factors that may influence the risk pattern that male leaders are willing to assume. Furthermore, we maintain the assumption about gender differences persist in all cases, assuming more risk in the case of men than in that of women. Leader´s age Within the individual context, we identify age as a factor of valuable interest in making organizational decisions that involve risk. Previous evidence has shown that as individuals get older they become more risk averse (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003; Herrmann & Datta, 2006; Croci et al., 2017). Lee & Moon (2016) argue that when older senior managers have reached a certain economic status, they are not willing to take risks fearful of losing this social position. For example, Croci et al., (2017) using a sample of US oil and gas companies, found strong evidence on risk aversion behaviour present in CEOs approaching retirement age. These results were also confirmed in the analysis of corporate policies; Serfling (2014) showed that older CEOs tend to reduce the company's risk through less risky investment policies. Additionally, older CEOs also invest less in R&D, lean toward diversification policies, and maintain lower operating leverage. Therefore, the age of the leader is negatively related to risk taking. We prompt that this behaviour will also occur in the context of the franchise. Specifically, we suggest that gender differences in risk assumption persist in favour of men only for the sample of young leaders. On the other hand, within the organizational context, there are variables of special importance in the franchise industry such as: the sector, the size and the age of the chain. B2C and B2B sectors The literature on the organizational area of the company has indicated that the trend towards a riskier behaviour, for example, towards innovation, the digital context or the adoption of green corporate strategies, differs between sectors: B2C (oriented to the final consumer) and B2B (oriented to the commercial customer) (Frambach & Schillewaert, 2002; Gabriel & Nyshadham, 2008; Hoejmose et al., 2012). Paluch & Wünderlich (2016), through qualitative interviews, find that customers in the B2B sector are reluctant to services based on high-risk technology. The findings of this study reveal that persistent personal and psychological fear in clients in this sector prevents them from using technology-based services. Therefore, there is a widespread rejection of innovation and risk in the commercial customer-oriented (B2B) sector. In a study on corporate reputation, Brammer et al., (2009) using a sample of large companies in the UK, found that companies operating in B2C sectors are more flexible in assessing gender diversity on the board directive. Specifically, the findings revealed that the presence of women on the board of directors improves corporate reputation, particularly in sectors oriented to the final customer (B2C). Thereby, the empirical evidence supports that the B2C sector presents a behavioural tendency towards change, flexibility and risk in different strategic areas; while the B2B sector is more airtight and inflexible and tends to establish strategies that reduce the level of risk. In short, the most important reason that the literature supports is that risk is not well seen by customers in the B2B sector, whilst it is valued positively by customers in the B2C sector. We expect to find similar behaviour in the context of the franchise. Specifically, we suggest that it is the B2C sector that presents gender differences on risk. Thereby, we do not expect find them in the B2B sector. Chain´s size On the other hand, from the Resource-Based Perspective (Barney, 1991) we find a solid theoretical argument to suggest that larger companies with more years of experience have greater potential to generate a sustained competitive advantage. For this reason, larger and more experienced companies are more predisposed than smaller and less experienced companies to make decisions that involve a high-level of risk. Thus, risk-taking behaviour at the organizational level manifests itself as the disposition to strategic resources becomes more evident. A study on supply chains and risk by Finch (2004) corroborated that large companies increase their exposure to risk due to the creation of inter-organizational networks. In other words, having strategic partners such as SMEs in the supply chain increases the risk exposure of large companies. At the same time there is a trend towards risk taking in large companies; Ellegaard (2008) shows a contrary behaviour pattern in small companies. The results of this study reveal that small-sized supply chains use a defensive approach to managing risk. In other words, small companies tend to take less risk and protect themselves by applying relational practices with their suppliers. Following this approach, we foresee that the size of the chains will influence the assumption of risk. Specifically, we propose that gender differences be maintained, only in the sample of large chains. Chain´s experience This same behavioural standard occurs when organizational experience is taken into account, in terms of number of years operating. For example, Hahn et al., (2009) using a data set on patents in 55 countries, find that learning through experience leads to the search for greater risk. The findings suggest that companies can learn from their own experiences and process this knowledge in a way that prompts them to explore environments of greater complexity and uncertainty. These findings are in line with the literature on organizational management and internationalization (Li, 1995; Hahn, 2009) that suggests that companies benefit from learning acquired through experience. This knowledge can be transferred to other markets and unfamiliar contexts where risk is perceived positively compared to companies with no prior experience (Duke/Archstone, 2005). In this sense, the experience can be considered a valuable and inimitable resource from the Resource Based Perspective. Therefore, it makes sense to think that, in franchise chains, where the concept of “know- how” or knowledge transfer arises (Perrigot et al., 2017), the higher level of experience of the chain is related to a greater assumption risk. Therefore, we expect to find the same standard of gender differences over risk only for the sample of chains with a high-level of experience. STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES Drawing on the previous theoretical base that includes biological and psychological approaches on risk preference by men and assumption by women; we propose the main hypothesis of the study: H1: Franchise chains run by male leaders take more risk than those run by female leaders. Then, based on the previous literature on approaches to organizational behaviour, we suggest that certain factors may influence the pattern of risk present in male leaders. Therefore, we propose the following study hypotheses: H2: The interaction between the age and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. H3: The interaction between the sector and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. H4: The interaction between the chain's size and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. H5: The interaction between the franchising experience and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. METHODOLOGY Data collection and Measures This study has been carried out within the Spanish franchise market. All the data relating to the profile of the franchisor leader, the chain's organizational context and the economic dimension of the risk come from an online survey addressed to all franchisors who are members of the Spanish Franchise Association (“AEF” as per its Spanish acronym). This directory of franchises is the most important in the country since it brings together all the franchisors that carry out activities in Spain. Furthermore, all of them are committed to complying with the standards of the European Code of Ethics for Franchising. In another line of affairs, the AEF is part of the European Franchise Federation (EFF) which is the main advocate of the franchise industry in Europe. Therefore, all franchisor members associated with the AEF represent the most relevant and comprehensive set of franchise chains in terms of economic and ethical business conduct. During the data collection period, in 2017, the Spanish franchise system had 1,348 brands, of which 82.8% were of national origin and 17.2% of international origin (Spanish Franchise Association, 2018). Currently, the franchise system is made up of 1,381 national and international brands, which indicates a slight increase in the number of operating entities, despite the current turbulent times (Spanish Franchise Association, 2020). The data collection method used is in line with other research on franchising that has also used national business directories as the main source for the sample selection of franchise systems (see: Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012 in the German market; Perrigot et al., 2015 in the French market). The final sample consisted of a total of 246 Spanish franchise companies. Respondents were the managing directors of the franchise companies, who are responsible for setting standards in the franchise networks. Of the 246 companies, 183 of them had a male leader and 63 had a female leader. In addition, 174 companies were from the B2C sector, and 72 from the B2B sector (see Appendix A for more a full summary of sample demographics). Chain Risk Measure. We measure the risk assumed by franchise chains through the chain's discontinuation rate for a period of three years (2013-2017). Several authors point out that the choice to break up a project or business that has implied a considerable initial investment implies a high risk for the companies (Cazier, 2011; Lu and Wang, 2018; Yeoh & Hooy, 2020). Hence, the decision to discontinue an establishment in a franchise chain implies the assumption of the risk of loss of the initial investments involved in setting up and developing such establishment. This indicator has been used in the literature on risk management (Watson & Everett, 1996; Everett & Watson, 1998) and recommended by experts in the franchise arena such as Lafontaine (1992), who   points out that this index has an advantage over measures based on the variation of sales in the risk measurement. The decision to discontinue an establishment depends to a greater extent on the franchisor than on the franchisees. The final decision to discontinue or continue an establishment, through company-owned management or the appointment of another franchisee, is ultimately up to the franchisor. Thus, a high discontinuation rate will indicate that franchisors assume a greater degree of risk at the chain level. Gender. This study considered two genders of leaders (male and female) identified by the respondents. Several control variables were included to analyse the interaction between gender and certain factors that can influence the risk assumed by franchise leaders. Leader´s age. (i.e., an individual characteristic of the leader) that was measured through the age of the leader grouped into two main categories: franchisors leaders in young age (Up to 50 years) and franchisors leaders in mature age (50 years and over). Then, we analyse the control variables referring to the organizational context. Sector. First of all, we take into account the sector to which the franchise chain belongs. Based on the sectorial classification of franchises offered by the Spanish Franchise Association, each franchise subsector was referenced with its corresponding category: B2C (subsectors that directly target the customer or the final consumer) or B2B (subsectors focusing on business-to-business transactions). Chain´s size. Second, we analyse the size of the franchise chain as another main control variable. The size of the chain was measured through the count of the number of establishments that include own establishments and franchised establishments during theend of 2017. This variable was grouped into two main categories: small chains (up to 49 establishments) and large chains (50 establishments or more). Chain´s experience. Finally, the chain's level of experience was measured by the number of years that the franchise chains had been franchising (a minimum of five years was considered). As in the previous cases, we divide the level of franchising experience into two main groups: chains with a low level of franchising experience (Up to 14 years) and chains with a high level of franchising experience (Over 15 years). (See Appendix A for more detail on control variable information). ANALYSIS AND RESULTS To analyse the gender differences on the risk in which franchise chains participate, one- way ANOVA tests were run with a bias corrected accelerated bootstrapping procedure of 5,000 samples. Results from ANOVA show a significant difference between genders, in which male leaders show a higher discontinuation rate than women, that is, we find empirical support for Hypothesis 1 which states that: “Franchise chains run by male leaders take more risk than those run by female leaders”; F (8.221)=1, p=0.005 =0.033, Mm=0.382 [0.02;0.17] (SD=0.799); Mf=0.086 [0.27;0.50] (SD=0.299) (see Table 1). [Table 1 about here] When testing the effects of the interaction between gender and each of the control variables, we found a behaviour deviation in the risk in which men participate. In the first place, when taking into account the age of the leader variable, we find that male leaders again exceed female leaders in the discontinuation rate, but it is young male leaders who present gender differences in the risk, which is in line with what was formulated in Hypothesis 2: “The interaction between the age and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(4.737)=1, p=0.032 =0.039 (in the young leaders sample) Mm=0.357 [0.19;0.55] (SD=0.854); Mf=0.030 [0.00;0.10] (SD=0.174) (see Table 2). [Table 2 about here] Next, we analyse the gender differences taking into account the chain sector (B2B and B2C) and we find that male leaders exceed female leaders in the discontinuation rate only in the B2C sector, which provides empirical support to the Hypothesis 3 which stated that: “The interaction between the sector and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(8.961)=1, p=0.003 =0.050 (in the B2C sample) Mm=0.392 [0.26;0.53] (SD=0.767); Mf=0.044 [0.00;0.11] (SD=0.208) (see Table 3). [Table 3 about here] Interestingly, when exploring gender differences in chain´s size individually, we find that male leaders present more risk than female leaders, solely in the small franchise chains, which is in line with the interaction effect raised by Hypothesis 4: “The interaction between the chain´s size and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(7.764)=,1 p=0.006 =0.044 (in the small franchise chain sample) Mm=0.421 [0.28;0.58] (SD=0.871); Mf=0.047 [0.00;0.12] (SD=0.213) (see Table 4). [Table 4 about here] Finally, when we evaluate the gender differences taking into account the chain's level of franchising experience, we find that chains with a high level of chain´s experience present gender differences with respect to risk, which offers empirical support for Hypothesis 5: “The interaction between the franchising experience and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(4.667)=1, p=0.033 =0.039 (in the sample of high level of chain´s experience) Mm=0.637 [0.44;0.85] (SD=1.001); Mf=0.184 [0.04;0.37] (SD=0.427) (see Table 5). [Table 5 about here] DISCUSSION The behaviour of male and female leaders differs in everything related to risk management. Exploring the limits of this behaviour has become a matter of enormous interest to the scientific community by different academic disciplines. The vast body of the existing literature recognizes that men are willing to take more risk than women. This result has been repeated in most of the research through the analysis of individual perceptions and preferences on various financial matters that involve risk decisions. Nevertheless, there is not as much empirical evidence on how male and female leaders behave in the real environment within the organizational and strategic context (Brooks et al., 2019). We identify the franchise environment as an ideal analysis environment for observing the risk decisions made by the highest managers of the chain, the franchisor leaders. Following Lafontaine (1992), we evaluate the risk assumed by leading franchisors through the chain's discontinuation rate over a three-year period, which offers key information on the risk of loss of the initial investment. The closure rate is a widely accepted indicator for evaluating business risk (Everett & Watson, 1998) since the closure of an establishment implies the loss of a good part of the investment previously made in said establishment. In other words, when an establishment closes, a significant part of the investment made in that establishment is lost. Therefore, the higher the closing rate of a chain, the greater the risk of loss assumed by the chain. There is a behavioural tendency to continue investing in a business even knowing that it is not working. This is related to the cognitive biases of individuals and the process of selection and interpretation of the available information. As pointed out by Delgado-García et al., (2010), although decision makers use elements or benchmarks to assess the risk of elections, these leaders may present deviations in their tendency to risk. This is due to the systematic use of heuristics during the decision making process. According to Gowda (1999, p. 63): \"people rely on several important and systematic shortcuts when making judgments about the probabilities of events.\" As a result, individuals use their heuristics to facilitate decision making based on their actual preferences. Tversky & Kahneman (1981) point out that these preferences come from individual cognitive frames and can vary in a predictable way depending on how the same problem is framed. Therefore, the unconscious preference towards risk assumption or aversion is key in the decision to close or cease the business. In this study we consider the role of gender on the risk assumed by the leaders of franchise chains in the real environment in which they operate. In addition, we identified a series of personal factors, such as the leader's age and organizational factors, such as the sector, size and experience of the chain, which may divert the risk-taking behaviour present in male leaders. Our results are in line with established theory and in all cases we observe that men present a higher discontinuation rate than women. This means that male leaders are willing to take more risk of losing the initial investment than female leaders. These results support the main hypothesis of the study (H1). Then, when we include the control variables such as the age of the leader, the sector, the size and the experience of the chain, we found interesting findings on the deviations in male risk-taking behaviour. In relation to the personal variable, the age of the leader, our results corroborate that the age of the leader influences holding at risk and specifically; it is young men who assume more risk than women. No gender differences are observed for the sample of adult franchisor leaders, which is in line with expectations (H2). Within the group of variables that include the organizational characteristics of the chains, we observe that there is a greater assumption of risk in the chains that operate in the B2C sector and the chains with a high-level of experience. In both cases, the hypotheses previously raised that predicted a greater assumption of risk by men than women are fulfilled (H3 and H5). Nonetheless, a surprising result is revealed in these analyses, which refers to the size of the chain in relation to the H4. Contrary to expectations, smaller chains have a higher discontinuation rate than larger chains. That is, men who run small chains take more risk than those who run large chains. This finding, while surprising, is in line with some of the life cycle and technology literature that suggests that, during the experimentation stage, companies are willing to assume a high degree of uncertainty (Markard, 2020). Therefore, taking risk in the early stages of creation is related to the purpose of growth. It is interesting to note that, despite observing a higher discontinuation rate in small chains than in large chains; the same does not happen when we analyse the experience level of the chains. This is due to the results revealed about the franchising experience (H5) where chains with a higher level of experience take more risks than chains with a low-level of experience. Thus, it is possible to think that there may be small chains with a lot of experience that have not yet grown in size. Therefore, these chains may be willing to take risks to continue growing and for this reason they present a higher rate of discontinuity. Meanwhile, other chains may be large, but have little franchising experience. These chains may have grown very fast and their low-level of experience prevents them from taking any further risks. As a result of this rapid growth without sufficient prior experience, they have a lower discontinuation rate. In another line of explanations, Everett & Watson (1998) point out that size limits small companies to diversify risk and this forces them to risk more to achieve their growth goal. Therefore, our unexpected finding would also make sense under this line of reasoning. In short, in all the analyses carried out, including the individual and organizational factors, the same pattern of behaviour towards risk-taking by male leadership is repeated. Therefore, our results provide empirical support for the bulk of the literature that suggests the existence of a prominent gap between gender and business risk. In addition, they do it, evaluating the risk of the decisions made in the context of the franchise. Namely, we analyse the real context and taking a step beyond the analysis based on psychological perceptions or preferences. CONCLUSIONS, FUTURE RESEARCH LINES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY Our results contribute to the field of strategic decisions, risk in the upper echelons leadership and the franchise and gender literature by examining in-depth how franchisor leaders behave in terms of risk taking within the real economic context at the chain level. We found that male leaders present a higher discontinuation rate than female leaders, which reveals a greater assumption of risk. We observe that this pattern of behaviour is continually repeated taking into account variables of interest such as the age of the leader and others related to the organizational field such as the sector where they operate (B2B and B2C), the size and level of experience of the chain. Additionally, an interesting finding reveals that there are gender differences in risk in favour of men, only in small chains, instead of large chains as we expected to find. Nonetheless, the same does not happen when we evaluate the chain's level of experience, where chains with a higher level of experience present gender differences in risk. This result raises a question of future academic interest, which could be to analyse the life cycle and growth speed of franchise chains, which may influence the risk assumed by the franchisor leadership. In terms of evaluating the risk in which franchise chains participate, this study offers an alternative to measure questionnaires based on opinion or perception of risk by using data on the discontinuation rate of franchise chains for a period of three years. Future research could address the behavioural differences in risk that franchise chains participate by using this indicator and analysing other variables that may influence leadership gender. For example, within the context of the family franchise, it would be of great interest to observe whether the pattern of risk-taking behaviour for men and aversion for women is repeated through generations of franchisor leaders. Future research could also address whether the risk of closure of establishments in a given franchise chain is related to the gender of the franchisees. Finally, we acknowledge that the study has limitations, for example, in relation to being conducted within one geographical location (in one country). We believe that this limitation offers researchers fruitful opportunities for further research, by applying the theories and analysis to broader contexts. \n",

McIntyre, University of West Georgia This critical incident was prepared by the authors and is intended to be used as a basis for class discussion.  The views presented here are those of the authors based on their professional judgment.    IntroductionElizabeth Torres reviewed the documents sent to her from the Phillips, Cantor and Shalek law firm in October 2020.  The Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC, (i.e., the franchisor) was suing her and her partner, Cory Attardo, for loan default involving their two I Heart Mac and Cheese locations (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  The franchisor also pursued unspecified monetary damages from Torres related to an email she sent in September (Ewen, 2020b).  She had twenty days to respond to the lawsuit.   The Relationship History Founded in 2016, I Heart Mac and Cheese was “a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in customizable, made to order macaroni and cheese bowls and grilled cheese sandwiches” (I Heart Mac & Cheese, 2020).  Stephen Giordanella, CEO of the Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, stated “It’s a very inexpensive franchise to get into.  It’s created for the family that may have a little equity in their home, where they could take out a second mortgage, and get into their own business and control their own destiny as a family.” (Maze, 2020).  Entrepreneur Magazinenamed the concept a “top new franchise” in 2019, and USA Today placed it in the “10 best fast-casual restaurants” in 2020 (Maze, 2020).   Each prospective franchisee paid a nonrefundable $35,000 franchise fee and upon opening continued to pay the franchisor through a percentage of gross sales comprised of 5% royalty fees, up to 3% brand fund contributions, and at least 1% local advertising fees (I Heart Mac & Cheese, 2020).  The initial franchisee agreement ran for ten years with an option for renewal.  Prospective franchisees also needed to show liquid capital of $75,000, secure a location, and obtain financing to cover a total investment that ranged from $251,000 to $464,500 depending on the geographic location (Maze, 2020).  The franchisor stated in 2020 that it had franchised over 100 locations to date (Ewen, 2020a), however, as of mid-October only thirteen locations (five company-owned and eight franchised) were in operation (Maze, 2020). On April 9, 2019, Torres and Attardo purchased two existing I Heart Mac and Cheese restaurants in New York that were then owned and operated by the franchisor.  Torres and Attardo agreed to a purchase price of $463,167 for the Patchague location and $306,088 for the Bayside location.  After the initial down payments, they signed two promissory notes with the franchisor for the remaining purchase price balances of $231,583 and $230,838, respectively.  The two locations came fully furnished with existing “furniture, fixtures, cooking, cooling and heating equipment, computer equipment, inventory, televisions, monitors, flooring, wall coverings, décor components, computer hardware, other tangible property… sales and promotional literature, client lists, and other marketing or service-related materials” (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).Torres and Attardo seemed successful with their two locations until the Covid-19 pandemic struck the New York City metropolitan area in early March 2020.  New York soon became the U.S. epicenter of the disease and its governor shut down all indoor dining statewide (Sutton, 2020), and both locations remained closed throughout the summer.  On April 1, Torres and Attardo failed to pay their required monthly promissory payments of $4,585 for Patchague and $2,350 for Bayside, and on May 1, no payment once again was submitted for the Bayside location (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  As a result, the franchisor agreed to accept half payments from the Patchague location of $2,292 for April and May deferring the remaining amount across the last six months of the year; for Bayside, the franchisor agreed to defer the two months of missed payments across the next four months (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  However, Torres and Attardo failed again to make the full renegotiated payment amounts for both locations (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  Payment ceased in August for Bayside, and they unilaterally closed the location.  Patchague closed in September, and all payments stopped.  By October, $37,413 was past due.Decision Time for TorresTorres read through the exhibits in the lawsuit.  Besides the expected copies of the franchise purchase agreements and promissory notes, a chain of six emails (shown in Table 1) involving Torres and eight other individuals (most unnamed) about formatting a letter of intent for a franchisee was included (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  The last email was the source of the Mac and Cheese Franchise Group claims of slander, libel, defamation, and tortious interference in a business relationship against Torres.                                 Table 1: Email Chain – Re: IHeartMac&Cheese – LOI template for California franchisee August 20, 2020 At 3:32 p.m.  – Whitney Dutton, a real estate advisor based in Florida wrote: “Funny, I just got a draft of mine today for a site we are submitting on.   Once I get the final draft back I’ll share it with the group.”  At 3:36 p.m.  – Brandi Taylor replied: “Here is my first one before we renegotiated terms.

At 5:28 p.m.  – Elizabeth Torres replied: “From corporate nothing was granted as relief… my landlords did however offer a reduction in rent and are allowing me time to catch up but not all my locations are surviving this.   We are still struggling hard in NY” September 11, 2020  At 7:14 a.m.  – Whitney Dutton wrote: “We are close to coming to agreement with landlord.   Here is the basis of our LOI negotiations.   Anyone seeing anything else to creative that I should be asking for?” September 28, 2020  At 12:36 p.m.  – Elizabeth Torres replied: \"If you can get out I would advise you DO NOT move forward.  I have to close my two NY locations and there is not a way to make money on these with the franchise fees and food costs rising… this is a scam and lawsuits are pending against corporate\" The franchisor was involved in several lawsuits with former franchisees (Maze, 2020).  For example, Genevieve Prieto opened an Oklahoma location in 2018, but it closed within 8 months (Ewen, 2020a).  She accused the franchisor of selling a business concept that was unprofitable.  The lawsuit included several accusations including illegal financial performance representations; she was told sales in the flagship restaurant in Florida were $700,000, but documents revealed sales of less than $300,000 (Ewen, 2020c).  In October 2020, the franchisor sent her a “cease and desist” notice claiming she had defamed the brand (Ewen, 2020a).  Kim Grotz and her husband opened a location in Georgia in 2019, but it closed within 5 months (Maze, 2020).  Her lawsuit accused the franchisor of using equipment that she leased from a third party.  Gordanella expressed some empathy, but blamed the failed franchisees, stating “I feel terrible for people who aren’t successful.  It’s like any business.  You have to work it hard” (Maze, 2020).   Regardless, dozens of prospective franchisees, such as Vinny Greco in New York, continued to sign up in 2020, willing to take the risk despite the lawsuits.  Greco stated that “We’re willing right now to take a one-store gamble…” (Ewen, 2020a).  Torres knew she had just joined the list of lawsuits.  What course of action should she take in response to the franchisor’s legal action?\n",
      "A CROSS-NATIONAL STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE CONSUMERS Massiel Carolina Henriquez Parodi PhD Research Fellow University of Agder University of Udine Kristiansand, Norway massiel.henriquez@uia.noIlan Alon Professor University of Agder Kristiansand, Norway ilan.alon@uia.no Michela Cesarina Mason Associate Professor University of Udine Udine, Italy michela.mason@uniud.it Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School May 24-26, 2021 A CROSS-NATIONAL STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE CONSUMERS Abstract This paper studies the behavioral intentions of global restaurant consumers and the mediating role of their perception of value in 15 countries: Austria, Italy, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, France, Spain, Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Thailand and Russia.  The international restaurant franchise studied in this paper has standardized to a great extent its operations, marketing strategy,  atmospheric elements and its products and services globally. This paper analyses to what extent the standardization of the servicescape and quality elements of international franchise restaurants are effective and whether or not atmospheric and quality elements of a food retailer have a positive influence in the value perception, and ultimately, in the behavioral intentions of its international consumers. Furthermore, we study whether or not there are significant differences between consumers from emerging and developed countries. Drawing from the Spence et al., (2014) framework and using structural equation modelling, we found that the visual, auditory and environmental servicescape elements together with the quality of products and services offered by the company, have a positive influence in the perceived value and behavioral intentions of international restaurant consumers. Furthermore, when comparing differences between emerging and developed countries through a multigroup analysis, we found that service quality and lighting have a different effect in value perceptions and patronage intentions of consumers in these markets, therefore fast-food restaurant managers should reconsider the standardization of these elements when internationalizing in these markets.  Key words: standardization, food retail atmospherics, international franchising, global brand, consumer behavior. A cross-national study of international franchise consumers Introduction Business format franchising consists of a contractual agreement between two firms, the franchisor and the franchisee, where the franchisee pays the franchisor for the right to sell the franchisor products, using its trademark and business format during a specific period of time (Blair & Lafontaine, 2005). Franchising has been widely used as an internationalization strategy for MNEs in service industries, especially in the hotel, restaurant, retail and general service industries (Alon et al., 2020).  Service industries are suited for franchising because their knowledge is codifiable and replicable (Brouthers and Hennart, 2007) which allows standardization and consistent quality through franchise contracts (Hennart, 2019) and facilitates benefiting from economies of scale (Fladmoe-Linquist and Jacque, 1995). Firm standardization has two different levels of centrality in the business strategy. These levels are divided in core and peripheral elements (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999). In franchising, the core elements are those that are central for the operation and survival of the business and its standardization should be system wide (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999). Peripheral elements are those where the benefits of standardization can be balanced with the benefits of local adaptation (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999).  McDonalds is one of the best examples of a successful franchise company that has become a leading firm and has steadily been among the top global brands. One of its key characteristics is that it uses a franchising to expand domestically in the United States and a strategy for internationalization. Therefore, nearly all its operations and products are standardized, and they maintain high standardization levels across their franchise system compared with other fast-food franchises (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999). The fact that they offer nearly the same key products in all countries, as well has having nearly the same service scape, services and procedures, times and movements in all countries where the company is present. This brings the question: Is the perception of the atmospheric characteristics and food and service quality of an international franchise restaurant affecting the value perception of its global consumers? Are the behavioral intentions influenced by the atmospheric cues perceived during the experience of visiting the restaurant? Are there differences in sensory perceptions between developed and emerging markets? This study aims to shed light on these questions. Roth (1995) analyzed the moderating effect of national culture and regional socioeconomic variables in the relationship of sensory and functional brand image strategies with product performance of two product categories. In his study, he recognized that certain products may require customization, as changes in cultural and socioeconomic contexts could entail adjustments of the brand. This relates to the need to reach and maintain cross-national consistency of the brand across markets. Additionally, Park and Rabolt (2009) studied cultural value, consumption value and its influence on brand image. In their study, they suggest that future research considers cultural characteristics when ascertaining the differences of brand image elements, investigating it from the perspective of cross-cultural consumer behavior. Additionally, their recommendations are to include the level of economic development as a national characteristic when identifying the differences of brand perceptions across the world.  As Grewal, Levy and Kumar (2009) affirm, the analysis of macro factors has not received enough attention in the consumer research literature. The analyses in this paper take into consideration national differences on the relationship between atmospheric elements, sensory cues, perceived product and service quality and the perception of value and behavior of the consumers of global brands, to understand to what extent different markets perceive the sensorial cues of the retail environment and how consumer perceptions and behaviors differ across markets. Additionally, in line with Roth (1995), there is need for more studies that focus on changes in the environment, consumer perceptions and the effect of the customization of strategic marketing and brand elements (Roth, 1995).  In this study, it will be studied the differences in perception of between developed and emerging market consumers. By performing a multi-group analysis, the differences in culture and economic development are taken into consideration to analyzing the effect of atmospheric cues, products and service quality and its relationship with the perception of value, as an antecedent of behavioral intentions in developed and developing countries. Consequently, as an extension of previous research and existing models of retail atmospherics (Donovan and Rossiter, 1982, Spence, Puccinelli, Grewal & Roggeveen, 2014;Rogeveen, Grewal and Schweiger, 2019), we propose a model of multisensory restaurant atmospherics influencing the behavior of international restaurant consumers.  The contribution of this paper is twofold: it aims to analyze the role of atmospherics in international restaurant franchising, considering the effect of the context on the relationship servicescape elements and quality of products and services, as an antecedent of value perceptions and behavioral intentions of consumers in global markets.  Additionally, it sheds light into the standardization-adaptation dichotomy that international retailers, specifically in the restaurant industry, face when entering global markets and expanding internationally. In line with Chabowski, Hult and Mena (2011), this study answers their call for more research emphasizing consumer topics and franchising, specifically, studies that analyze variable such as perceived value and retail atmospherics. This paper studies the relationship of servicescape elements and quality with the standardization strategy in international franchise chains.  By juxtaposing consumer-centered research issues with research in international franchising and marketing, this paper provides a clearer understanding of standardization-adaptation decisions by international franchise firms and the journey of the consumers of global food retailers.  This research questions have been answered using survey data of McDonald consumers from 15 countries: Austria, Italy, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, France, Spain, Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Thailand and Russia, analyzed with multigroup structural equation modelling.  Theoretical background The servicescape is the place where the services are delivered and it could be compared with the packaging of a tangible product: in the same way as the packaging of a product is important for the correct communication of the brand’s attributes, the place and mode in which the services are delivered constitute the service scape.  (Solomon, 1985) The way in which a product is designed to convey a specific meaning and generate emotions, consistent with the brand image, the place of service delivery or servicescape should also be designed to convey a message through the sensory elements and environmental cues, signaling about the brand identity and attributes, while simultaneously enhancing the customer experience and adding value to the consumer journey. (Solomon, 1985; Blitner 1992; Baker, Parasuraman, Grewal & Glenn, 2002). In industries where the delivery of services is one of the core aspects, the design and presentation of the servicescape is highly important. Music and auditory cues Music has a significant impact in the emotions and behaviors of consumers. As shown by Mattila and Wirtz (2011), different types of music can stimulate different kinds of emotions and behaviors. When music is paired with scent, it leads to arousal conditions and enhanced pleasure, and it increases the positive perception of the environment, as well as the buying impulse and satisfaction. When pleasant cues are provided to the consumer, it can enhance the positive purchase experience (Milliman, 1982; Mattila and Wirtz, 2011). Garling and Owen (2006) also found that consumers stayed longer at a retail place when the music was familiar, had a lower volume and a slow tempo. Moreover, Caldwell and Hibbert (2002) in their study of music influence on behavior patterns of restaurant consumers, found that music preferences influence the time spent in the restaurant, which consequently influences the expenditure on food by the consumers.  Lighting  Ryu and Han (2011) studied how the customer perceptions of the physical aspects influence satisfaction and loyalty for those who were first time and repeating consumers in restaurants. They demonstrated that lighting, together with layout and service, had a significant effect on disconfirmation, satisfaction and loyalty. Lighting is one of the servicescape elements used by retailers to achieve optimal levels of sensory stimulation that can contribute to a positive consumer cognition, affect and behavior, in relation to the type of atmosphere that the retail establishment is trying to achieve (Spence et al., 2014). In the context of restaurants, lighting plays an important role to define the type of atmosphere and sensorial experience created for the consumers, constituting an important visual element of the brand identity (Rogeveen et al., 2019). Internal and external layout The customer experience starts before the costumer enters the store, therefore retailers need to acknowledge that it is part of a longer journey that occurs inside and outside the retail environment (Rogeveen, et al., 2019), the layout is one of the servicescape elements that has an important functionality element as its design provides the consumer with directions and facilitates the completion of sales (Bitner, 1992). According to Baker et al. (2002), the design cues of the retail store is the component of the atmospheric retail element that has the strongest influence on patronage intentions. The interior design of a store can determine how long a consumer will stay in the restaurant. Wakefield and Blodgett (1996) found that the aesthetic appeal of the site, layout accessibility, the décor and the architectural design had a significant effect on the perceived servicescape quality, satisfaction, and with the desire to stay. Product and service quality  The quality of goods and services is a key determinant of the perception of value in the shopping experience (baker et al., 2002). In firms that operate within the hospitality industry, the performance of employees in contact with the consumer is an essential driver to determine the consumer service quality perception (Jang and Namkung, 2009). The quality of goods and services an important characteristic for the consumers, as it determines to a great extent the perception of value and satisfaction for the consumer. When the image of the company is positive, the perception of quality of their products and services increases (Konuk, 2018). Previous research has found that food quality, which involves freshness, a good presentation, a good taste and menu item variety, influences consumer satisfaction(Kivela, Inbakaran & Reece, 1999). Ambience  Initially, ambience was one of the factors included as one of the three servicescape dimensions by Bitner (1992), in addition to spatial layout and functionality.  In the context of this study, ambience constitutes other non-visual environmental elements, such as olfactory cues, background noise, smell of the restaurant, air quality and temperature.  Biswas and Szocs (2019) found that when customers are exposed to the smell of indulgent food ambient scents such as baked cookies, it causes less purchases of unhealthy food, in contrast to the absence of scent or the smell of a non-indulgent food. International franchise chains like Subway, Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and Cinnabon use olfactory marketing and use food ambient scents to attract customers. Scent marketing has also been used by retail firms, hotels and resorts to engage customers through the sense of smell (Glazer, 2017).  Perception of value In 1988, Valarie Zeithal defined value as the consumer’s general evaluation of the usefulness of a product according to the perceptions of what is received on exchange of something given. Value is characterized to be a more complex construct. It is different to quality in that the value is a personal construct, therefore considered as a higher-level abstraction than quality. It also encompasses a dynamic of giving and receiving with involves resources such as monetary payment, time, energy and effort (Zeithaml, 1988). Although value definitions and specifications are generally related with quality, other components such as intrinsic (Olson & Jacoby, 1972) (concrete elements related with the physical constitution of the product) and sensory attributes, can be included by the consumer as a signal of quality that provides them with value (Zeitham, 1988). Multisensory restaurant atmospherics The effects of store atmospherics are emotional states that are difficult to articulate and remember, which also influence the behavior of consumers, affecting their intention to patronize the store (Donovan and Rossiter, 1982). The theoretical framework in this study is initially organized based on a Stimulus-Organism-Response model: it was originally proposed by environmental psychologists Mehrabian and Russel in 1974. It suggests that the environmental stimuli (s) generate emotional and cognitive processes (O) that generate a specific behavior or response (Chang, Eckman and Yan, 2011).  In 1982, Robert Donovan and John Rossiter were the first researchers to apply the model to a retail environment. A suitable S-O-R model is composed by a stimulus taxonomy or environment, a group of conceptually clear and measurable intervening variables and a response, which in the case of Donovan and Rossiter (1982) are approach or avoidance behaviors towards a retail store, measured by the willingness to pay, the desire to explore or not to explore the store, to exit the store, to communicate or interact with others and the plans to repeat the shopping experience.  Since then, the Mehrabian-Russel model has been widely applied in marketing research to analyze the elements of retail environments, in terms of the specific characteristics that generate stimuli to the consumers (Spangenberg and Crowley, 1996).  It is a theory that explains how the environmental exposure influence the consumer purchase decision (Slama and Tashchian, 1987).  and drawing from the multisensory framework by Spence et al (2014), a model of global multisensory restaurant atmospherics is proposed.  In the case of this study, instead of a set of the emotional mediating states such as pleasure, arousal and dominance used by Donovan and Rossiter (1982), the mediating variable is the perception of value of the consumers of an international food retailer. Furthermore, in this study the resulting or response variables of approach or avoidance are measured in terms of the behavioral intentions of the consumers, specifically whether or not they intent to comeback, choose, speak positively and recommend the restaurant to others in the future.

The survey was designed using 7-point Likert scale and applied to consumers when exiting the restaurant, with the objective that the respondent would have a clear memory of the perceptions that were part of the consumer experience in the restaurant. It was performed in 2 specific places in each chosen city:  in a McDonalds restaurant located in the city center and another located in a shopping mall. The data was collected in 2015. The questionnaire was designed using 7-point likert scale. It includes the following constructs: environment perceptions (like music, lightning, ambience, internal and external layout), actual and ideal self-concept of consumers, with respect to a “stereotypical” McDonald’s consumer, product quality perceptions, service perceptions, quality perceptions, consumer satisfaction and behavioral intentions. For the purpose of this study it was used partial least squares. It was chosen as the method of analysis because it allows the analysis of complex hypothesized models as it contains many constructs and relationships between variables, in addition to the exploratory aspects of the study (Hair et al., 2018). The respondents that are part of the analysis are from 15 different countries: Argentina, Austria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Portugal Russia, Spin, Thailand and the United Kingdom for a total of 8,290 respondents, who approximately 50.52% identified themselves as male and 49.48% as female.

The effect of product quality is strong, with a coefficient of 0.621 (p-value less than 0,001), confirming hypothesis H6. Additionally, service quality was found to be significant, positively affecting value perception (β=0,339; p-value<0,001) supporting H7. Light has a direct positive effect on value perception (β=0.032, p-value=0.016), confirming H3. External and internal layout were also significant, with a beta equal to 0,131 and 0,108, and p-values lower than 0,001 respectively, confirming H4 and H5.   Music was found to be the only non-significant variable in its relationship with the perception of value and behavioral intentions in the model, failing to confirm hypothesis H1. Additionally, we can affirm that perceived value has a strong positive relationship with behavioral intentions (β=0.621, p-value<0.001), therefore we fail to reject H8 and inferring support to our model. The R for perceived value is 0.557 and for behavioral intentions is 0.38 which shows the high explanatory power of the model.  Table 5. Specific Indirect effectsRelationship Coeff. Sample Mean  S.D.

Music perceptions is the only significant variable with a negative significant indirect effect on behavioral intentions.  Meaning that based in our model, the type and volume of music played in the fast-food chain does not influence the willingness of the consumers to recommend the restaurant, to comeback or choose it again in the future and to say positive things of the restaurant.  After obtaining the bootstrapping results of the main structural equation model estimation, it was decided to make a comparison of the different countries via a multiple group structural equation analysis. This technique was also performed via bootstrapping with 5000 different subsamples. The main objective of this technique is to study whether or not the perceptions of value and behavioral intentions are different among countries. Another reason was to analyze the extent to which the inherent cultural and socioeconomic differences among emerging and developing markets affect the perceptions of service scape, quality, and its relationship with perceived value and intentions in both groups (table 6). In order to do that, a grouping variable was created. The 15 countries where divided in developing and developed countries, based on the United Nations country classification (2014). Among the developing countries are Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Israel, Russia and Thailand. The countries classified as developed, in the second group are: Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italia, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Table 6.

Discussion After performing the multigroup analysis comparing countries, we found that the only significant differences in perceptions between developed and developing countries are in the effects of service quality and lighting on value perceptions and intentions. When taking a closer look at the effect of service quality on value perceptions and consumer intentions, we can see that the quality of services in developing countries has a higher influence on value perceptions and patronage intentions of McDonalds consumers from developing countries than for consumers from developed economies.   This could mean that higher the level of development of the country, lower the influence of the service quality in the perception of value. Maybe, it could be due to the fact that more restaurants use self-service in developed countries compared to restaurants in emerging markets where labour costs are lower. This could imply that McDonalds needs to be attentive to the provided service quality and its influence on value perceptions in developing economies. Furthermore, McDonalds and international fast-food retailers need to analyze their procedures, operations and routines, as consumers in emerging markets give greater importance to the quality of services in fast food restaurants than the consumers in developed countries.  The other significant difference between emerging and developed countries is in the influence of lighting on the perception of value and intentions. Developing countries presented a negative, non-significant relationship between servicescape lighting, perceptions of value and behavioral intentions. In constrast, developed countries show a positive, significant relationship between lighting and value perception, posively affecting consumer patronage intentions. The fact that lighting does not affect significantly the value perception of McDonalds consumers in emerging markets, but it does affect value perceptions and behavior in developed markets confirms that there are social and cultural differences among consumers across countries and that those differences should be taken into consideration by managers when expanding internationally. This finding means that consumers in developed economies give greater importance to ambience and servicescape lighting in restaurants than their developing markets counterparts. Therefore, managers should pay greater attention to this servicescape element in developed economies as it could signify a greater value perception from their consumers in these markets, and ultimately, better patronage intentions.   Through these findings we can infer that service standardization, which has been one of the main characteristics of McDonalds and other international fast food franchise chains, should be reconsidered when entering developed and emerging economies, as not all elements are perceived equally across markets. Additionally, they could asses whether or not service quality procedures could be improved first in developing countries where service quality has a higher influence in consumer intentions, and then test or replicate the new standards in developed markets as incremental or significant system-wide quality improvements could signify a greater perception of value globally, and ultimately, better behavioral intentions and greater satisfaction and loyalty from consumers. Conclusions  We can see that the hypothesis were supported in the model, therefore it is possible to conclude that servicescape elements such as music and lightning, together with the quality of products and services offered by the company, have a positive influence in the perceived value of global firms. Moreover, the lightning, ambience, external and internal layout, and quality of products and services of the firm have an indirect effect in behavioral intentions trough the international consumers perception of value. Furthermore, the results indicate that servicescape lighting has a higher influence in the value perception and behavioral intentions of consumers from developed countries versus their emerging market counterparts where this relationship was non-significant. Additionally, the quality of services has a higher influence on the perception of value and behavior of consumers from developing countries, in comparison with the consumer from developed countries where the effect of service quality on value perceptions and patronage intentions is not as strong. This means that international franchise restaurants need to reconsider the standardization of these two elements, when expanding in global markets, as there are cultural and socioeconomic differences that can influence the perception of value and patronage intentions of their consumers.  Finally, the perceived value of international consumers positively affects the behavioral intentions towards the brand, influencing whether or not they will patronize it in the future.   \n",

Corporate Social Responsibility in franchise chains: Specificities, insights from French franchise chains’ CSD and avenues for future research Abstract Franchise chains – as most companies outside the franchise sector as well – are becoming increasingly committed to environmental, social and societal transitions. Despite this growing trend over the last decade, only a few researchers have focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the specific case of franchising. The aim of our paper is to explore how franchisors report on their sustainable practices, and emphasize subsequent directions for future research. In order to do so, we focused on Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) of franchisors operating in the French market in which regulations on non-financial information disclosure exist for large companies. It is based on a multiple case study approach, with the examination of CSD by eight franchise chains operating in hotels, fast food/bakeries, clothing and automotive repair industries in the French market. Our findings show that these franchisors disclose rich and diversified information on their CSR activities. Our research contributes to the literature on CSR in franchise chains and the practice. Keywords Franchising, Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development, Corporate Social Disclosure, Environmental, Social and Governance information.1. Introduction “‘I made the decision to remove plastic wherever possible, and we have invested a lot to innovate with answers that are relevant for our customers and for the environment’, explains McDonald’s France CEO, Nawfal Trabelsi. […] This approach is therefore part of McDonald’s France’s progressive positioning in terms of environmental transition, which began more than ten years ago. After changing its logo from red to green in 2010, the fast-food giant in France has made a series of eco-responsible commitments: organic milk in its milkshakes, delivery fleets fueled by used frying oil from its French restaurants, packaging designed to minimize waste, a waste sorting system for restaurants, and even an ‘energy plan’ implemented throughout the production chain, highlighted in particular by the installation of heat pumps.” (Le Parisien [French newspaper], 10 February 2021This is an example – among many others across various industries – of franchisors committed to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions. Indeed, franchise chains – as most companies outside the franchise sector as well (Chuah et al., 2020; Iglesias et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) – are becoming increasingly committed to environmental, social and societal transitions (Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018). A few years ago, Perrigot et al. (2015) showed that more than 85% of their 136 sampled French franchisors communicated about at least one of their CSR activities on their websites.  Despite this growing trend in the franchise sector over the last decade, research on CSR in the specific case of franchising remains limited (e.g., Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018). Scholars have, first, highlighted several determinants                                                             https://www.leparisien.fr/environnement/environnement-fini-les-jouets-en-plastique-chez-mcdonald-s-10-02-2021-8424323.php of franchise chains’ CSR actions, either chain characteristics (e.g., Choi & Lee, 2018; Kaufmann et al., 2008) or management-related characteristics (e.g., Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Sebastiani et al., 2014). Second, several studies focused on franchise chains’ Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) and franchisors’ motivations to communicate about their CSR activities (e.g., Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018). Third, various consequences of CSR practices on franchise chains were identified at the brand image level (e.g., Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017) as well as the managerial level (e.g., Lee et al., 2012; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012).  We believe that CSR, in the specific case of franchising, deserves particular attention and further investigation. The interest of studying CSR in the franchising context is twofold; not only franchising is relevant to the wider dissemination of CSR practices, but also CSR practices are relevant for franchise chains. On the one hand, franchising – through the duplication of a business-format in tens, hundreds or thousands of locations – is a way to maximize the impacts of CSR practices at the local, regional, national and even international levels. On the other hand, CSR can be beneficial to franchisors on several levels, including brand image. All franchisorsseek a strong brand image for their chains, in order to attract customers, franchisee candidates, employees for the units, etc. (Nijmeijer et al., 2014; Nyadzayo et al., 2011; Roh & Yoon, 2009). CSR practices and, above all the disclosure on CSR practices, provide a means for franchisors to reinforce their chain brand image (Cha & Jo, 2019; Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017; Perrigot et al., 2015). This positive impact on brand image can hence improve chain performance (Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017; Kim & Lee, 2020; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012).  Moreover, franchisors engaging in CSR actions can enhance their relationships with employees (Lee et al., 2012), and above all, with franchisees, in particular regarding franchisee trust and satisfaction, and prospective franchisees (Lee et al., 2016). According to these authors, such “activities will help franchisors not only retain current franchisees but also attract prospective franchisees by enhancing corporate image and solidifying the relationship with the franchisees” (Lee et al., 2016, p. 57).  Nevertheless, engaging in CSR activities is particularly challenging in the franchising context and thus requires specific attention as argued by Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012). Indeed, franchisees are independent entrepreneurs (Dant & Gundlach, 1999; El Akremi et al., 2011); hence, franchisors cannot impose CSR activities on their franchisees. For instance, if franchisees are not interested in CSR initiatives, franchisors cannot force them to invest in new waste sorting systems, or materials that are more eco-friendly, or specific local sponsorship. Franchisor explanations – conveyed through headquarters staff and on-field consultants – are mandatory for convincing franchisees to engage in CSR. These explanations entail the rationale behind such actions, the practices to be implemented and the potential impact on franchisees’ businesses in terms of image, customer relationship management, competitive advantage, performance, etc.  Moreover, when franchisees are committed to CSR activities, franchisors must pay close attention to the consistency of their implementation. For CSR actions to be impactful, franchisors and franchisees must both be consistent, franchisors at the global level (international, national or regional) and franchisees at the local level. For instance, if franchisors are committed to the inclusion of disabled people in their workforce, they will implement specific processes to accommodate disabled employees at the chain headquarters, do a partnership with an international or national charity organization dedicated to disabilities. They will also have to ensure that this action plan is being relayed at the local level. For instance, franchisees will be encouraged to employ disabled people in their units, and sponsor local associations dedicated to children, teens or adults with disabilities. Another example involves franchisors committed to environmental preservation, through working with an international or national NGO. Their franchisees will have to pursue the same strategy, by using recyclable products in their units and participating in local actions such as city or river cleaning days. Franchisor and franchisee CSR actions must be aligned, both emphasizing a set of consistent commitments.  Finally, franchisors must involve not only their franchisees but also all their stakeholders in their commitment towards CSR. Franchisors cannot succeed on their own in implementing CSR throughout their chains; they require the involvement of their main stakeholders, which of course include their franchisees (as mentioned above) as well as their suppliers, store employees, customers, etc. (Perrigot et al., 2021). Regarding suppliers, we can mention the fast food industry in which franchise chains’ suppliers will contribute to environmental preservation through an improved waste management system (e.g., supply of recyclable packaging), the grocery industry in which suppliers will promote local products, and the clothing industry in which suppliers will pay attention to working conditions inside the factories. Employees in direct contact with customers are especially decisive since they are the ones who will or will not apply the right practices in terms of waste management in the units. In addition, they (among other stakeholders) will encourage customers to participate in these minimization and sorting efforts, they will also include disabled people in their team. These specificities and challenges being exposed, the aim of our paper is to explore how franchisors report on their sustainable practices, and emphasize subsequent directions for future research. In order to do so, we focused on CSD, following most studies that used it as a proxy for activity in the area of social and environmental responsibility. Such studies are based on the assumption that the level of CSD is correlated with the company’s socially responsible behavior (Cowen et al., 1987; Perrigot et al., 2015; Roberts, 1992; Ullmann, 1985). Nowadays and in the French context, this hypothesis is reinforced by the adoption of several regulations dealing with non-financial information disclosure and audit (see section 3.1.). The term CSD is used to indicate corporate reporting focusing on environmental and social issues. CSD is not limited to financial information but involves such areas as climate change abatement, human rights, employee relations, product liability, philanthropy, and corporate governance. Firms usually disclose such kind of information in their annual reports, press releases, websites, or in separate social reports (Montecchia et al., 2016). While several authors used this CSD-based approach towards CSR (e.g., Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018), they did not focus on the content of franchisor messaging. Instead, they considered the presence or not and the number of occurrences of the information regarding specific CSR activities on franchisors’ websites. In this research, we go further by interpreting, from an in-depth qualitative viewpoint, the content of the information disclosed by franchisors. Since franchisors can signal their quality through CSD (Utgård, 2018), we expect the content of the information disclosed to provide a thorough understanding of their reporting strategies. This approach allows us to rely on data disclosed by franchisors and therefore accessible to their stakeholders rather than on declarative data. Moreover, we do not limit our observations to franchisor websites and include the content of the non-financial information of their annual reports when they publish any, as well as information released in the press.  Our empirical study deals with the French market in which regulations on non-financial information disclosure exist for large companies. It is based on a multiple case study approach, with the examination of CSD by eight franchise chains operating in hotels, fast food/bakeries, clothing and automotive repair industries in the French market.  Our findings show that franchisors disclose information covering a wide range of CSR activities related to environmental, social and societal challenges. To do so, they have developed highly structured approaches based, for example, on committees dedicated to CSR. Our research also emphasizes that franchisors can rely on various stakeholders to achieve their sustainable goals (e.g., franchisees, employees, customers). Moreover, in line with regulation theory (Perrigot et al., 2015; Posner, 1974), we notice that franchise chain actions can be influenced by a fear of future coercive measures, albeit some of their activities demonstrate a strong commitment to CSR and a willingness to exert a positive corporate impact (Depoers & Jérôme, 2017; 2019). In addition, we observe that chain characteristics (i.e., chain size and chain resources) and management-related characteristics (i.e., CSR experience) impact the extent of CSR, which is consistent with prior research (e.g., Choi & Lee, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015). Our research contributes to the literature on CSR in franchise chains and, more specifically, the stream dedicated to franchisors’ CSD (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Kaufmann et al., 2008; Perrigot et al., 2015; Perrigot et al., 2021; Utgård, 2018). More specifically, our paper provides new insights into franchise chain CSD, based on a multi-industry content analysis rather than mere content reporting. Our research also has managerial implications. Our findings may help franchisors enrich their CSR communication on their websites, and also engage in various CSR actions. They may additionally help them to target and select franchisee candidates who share their values, in order to maximize the efficiency of their CSR approach. To finish, our findings can serve to encourage franchisors to develop organizational know-how related to CSR and codify part of it as business know-how.  Our paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we review the literature on CSR in franchising. We present the methodology in the third section. We describe and discuss the findings of our multiple case study in sections 4 and 5, successively. 2. Literature review  2.1. Dimensions of franchise chains’ CSR practices As evidenced by Perrigot et al. (2015), franchise chains can engage in a wide range of CSR and sustainable actions (e.g., economic, social, environmental). Studying franchisors’ CSD practices thus requires finding or adapting a precise analysis grid that is as exhaustive and objective as possible, which can prove to be a complex task. Within the scope of franchising studies, several classifications developed by scholars and consulting firms have been used. Carroll's (1991) prominent pyramid of CSR, composed of economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities, has been favored by various authors (e.g., Cha & Jo, 2019; Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Lee et al., 2012). However, as pointed out by Kim and Thapa (2018), this classification neglects the environmental dimension, which also merits consideration. Kaufmann et al. (2008) used a four-dimensional grid – i.e., philanthropy, sponsorship, cause marketing, and volunteerism – that focuses on the nature of CSR actions rather than their outcome. Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012) based their study on the six dimensions of the KLD Research & Analytics, Inc. grid, slightly adapted to franchising specificities – support for the community, franchisee/employee relations, environment, human rights, products and services, corporate governance. As for Perrigot et al. (2015), they adapted a grid from Ernst and Ernst (1978) to assess the disclosure of franchisors operating in the French market; they distinguished seven categories of practices – environment, human resources, products, fair business practices, community involvement, ethics, and other practices. These categorizations are not enough accurate and researchers need to identify dimensions as indicated by “Grenelle II” Law (42 items described by the French regulator) and to investigate disclosure quality (Baalouch et al., 2019; Chauvey et al., 2015).2.2. Franchise chains’ CSR motivations In line with stakeholder-agency theory (Hill & Jones, 1992), franchisors will invest in CSR and disclose information regarding their sustainable activities only if it can be profitable for them (Perrigot et al., 2015). Similarly, scholars have referred to resource-based theory (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018) as well as signaling theory (Utgård, 2018) to support this opinion. More extensively, many academics examine, still now, the link between CSR and financial performance (Zhao & Murrell, 2021) in order to better manage CSR practices and understand corporate motivations. Consequently, CSR motivations and disclosure practices can vary significantly from one franchisor to the other depending on stakeholders’ expectations and their willingness to satisfy these expectations (Baird et al., 2012).  In fact, Sebastiani et al. (2014) classified franchisors into three groups based on their corporate sustainability strategy and the relationships they seek to develop with their franchisees. Traditionalist franchisors pay limited attention to sustainable issues and engage in a few sustainable actions with their franchisees. Relationship-focused franchisors mainly favor social practices aimed at enhancing sustainable relationships with their franchisees. True Bluesfranchisors engage in a wide range of social and environmental sustainable practices and seek to develop sustainable relationships with both internal (including franchisees) and external stakeholders. They found that more than two-thirds of their sampled franchisors and franchisors’ staff were into the first group, i.e., traditionalist franchisors. Franchisors can also invest in CSR practices in order to enhance their brand image vis-à-vis the final customers, who will be more loyal and more willing to spend money in their stores, the potential franchisees who will be more willing to join the chain as franchisees, as well as potential employees who will apply for available positions in the stores and at the headquarters (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015). For this brand purpose, franchisors disclose CSR information on their websites (Perrigot et al., 2015) and press releases (Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012), and in specific reports for some franchisors operating large chains. 3. Methodology 3.1. Context Our empirical study deals with franchising in France. France counts 2,049 franchisors and 78,218 franchised units generating an estimated 757,852 jobs and 67.80 billion euros of total sales (French Franchise Federation, 2021). Franchisors in the French market are especially committed to CSR. Indeed, an empirical study showed that 86.03% of 136 sampled franchisors were disclosing information on at least one CSR-related action (Perrigot et al., 2015), which is much higher than results from similar studies conducted in other markets, for example, 29% in the American market (Kaufmann et al., 2008) and 22.9% in the Mexican market (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018).  Moreover, in Europe, under NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive – Directive 2014/95/EU), since 2014, all large companies have to publish reports on the policies they implement in relation to ESG concerns: environmental preservation, social responsibility and treatment of employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, diversity on company boards (in terms of age, gender, educational and professional background). The directive offers flexibility for companies to disclose information in the way that they consider most useful. Nonetheless, they are obliged to give a description of their policies and results, the risks related to these matters and how they intend to address them. Subsequently, companies may use international, European guidelines or national laws. In France in particular, these requirements are not recent. Many regulations require companies both disclose non-financial information (social report Law, 1977 and New economic regulation Law, 2001), and audit this information (225 Art. Grenelle II, 2010). Consequently, large companies in France have a high level of maturity regarding CSD. Specifically with the environmental data, disclosures become more technical and precise (Albertini, 2014). Academics showed that the level of non-financial disclosure is positively related with the intensity of regulation (Barbu et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2020; Senn & Giordano-Spring, 2020). 3.2. Multiple case study approach We adopted a multiple case study approach to study franchisors’ CSD practices. This method has been used in the franchising literature (e.g., Bradach, 1997; Doherty & Alexander, 2006) and is particularly relevant for topics which have received scarce academic attention (Perry, 1998). To gain an extensive understanding of franchisors reporting practices, we focused on four different industries in which franchising is particularly well developed on one side, and CSR important on the other side: hotels, fast food/bakeries, clothing and automotive repair. For each of these industries, in an attempt to get diversified illustrative cases, we selected two distinct companies, one group operating several franchise chains subject to a reporting obligation and which therefore publish an annual report containing non-financial information, and another chain which is not affected by any reporting requirement.  Regarding the hotel industry, our illustrative cases are the Accor group and B&B Hôtels. The Accor group was founded by Paul Dubrule and Gérard Pélisson in 1967 when they opened the first Novotel hotel in Lille-Lesquin. The Accor group now includes 5,100 hotels under 39 brands in 110 countries worldwide, it generates 3.610 billion euros of total sales. Their most famous franchise chains in the French market are Ibis (created in 1973, franchised in 1974, 387 hotels in France), Ibis Budget (created in 1991, franchised in 1992, 351 hotels in France), Ibis                                                             https://group.accor.com/fr-FR/group/who-we-are/accor-in-brief Styles (created and franchised the same year, in 2007, 221 hotels in France), Mercure (created in 1973, franchised in 1975, 249 hotels in France) and Novotel (created and franchised the same year, in 1967, 114 hotels in France). As far as B&B Hôtels chain is concerned, it was founded in 1990, and started franchising in 1996. There are 493 B&B Hôtels in twelve countries, mainly in Europe, among which 70 franchised hotels and 230 company-owned hotels in FranceRegarding the fast food/bakery industry, our illustrative cases are the Le Duff group and La Mie Câline. The Le Duff group was launched in 1976 when Louis Le Duff opened the first Brioche Dorée in Brest. In addition to some activities in the agribusiness industry (e.g., Bridor), the group now operates five chains in the fast food/bakery and restaurant industries. Their largest fast food/bakery chain in the French market is Brioche Dorée, which was created in 1976 and started franchising in 1992. This is a plural form chain composed of 166 franchised units and 119 company-owned units in France. They also have 132 units abroad. Their other chains are Del Arte (208 Italian restaurants in France), Fournil de Pierre (16 units in FranceLa Madeleine (96 units in the United States) and Kamps (412 units in Germany). Concerning La Mie Câline, the first unit opened in 1985, and they started franchising the concept one year later, in 1986. The chain is now composed of 225 franchised units and 14 company-owned ones. They operate in the French market onlyRegarding the clothing industry, our illustrative cases are the Beaumanoir Group and Ekyog. The Beaumanoir Group was founded in 1981, when Roland Beaumanoir opened his first unit                                                             https://group.accor.com/fr-FR/group/who-we-are/accor-worldwide  http://www.franchise-hotelbb.com/  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/b-b-hotels  https://www.groupeleduff.com/home/historique  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/brioche-doree  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/Del-arte  https://www.groupeleduff.com/enseignes/fournil-pierre  https://www.groupeleduff.com/enseignes/madeleine  https://www.groupeleduff.com/enseignes/kamps  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/la-mie-caline in Saint-Brieuc. The group now operates various franchise chains in France and has a presence abroad, with 2,614 units in Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa. Their most popular franchise chains in the French market are Bonobo (created in 2002, franchised in 2006, 84 franchised units and 87 company-owned units) and Cache-Cache (created in 1985, franchised in 1991, 110 franchised units and 104 company-owned units). In 2016, they launched Vib’s, a multi-brand concept combining Bonobo, Bréal and Cache-Cache within a same unit. There are 182 units operated in France through franchising and company ownership. As far as Ekyog is concerned, it was launched in 2003, they started franchising in 2006. They now have 18 unitsRegarding the automotive repair industry, our illustrative cases are the Mobivia Group and Feu Vert. The Mobivia Group was founded by Eric Derville in 1970. They operate various businesses in link with automobile services, among which two famous franchise chains in the repair segment: Midas and Norauto. Midas started in 1952 in the United States and in 1976 in France, where the first franchised unit opened in 1979. Mobivia acquired the Midas brand in 2004. They now have 327 franchised units and 30 company-owned units in the French territory. Regarding Norauto, they started their businesses in 1970, and started their franchise operations in 1981. Their chain is composed of 130 franchised units and 276 company-owned units. As far as Feu Vert is concerned, the first unit was opened in 1972, and the first franchised unit in 1979. They have 182 franchised and 172 company-owned units in France                                                            https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/historique/  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/linternational/  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/bonobo  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/cache-cache https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/marque/vibs/  https://www.ekyog.com/fr/content/14-liste-des-boutiques-ekyog  https://www.mobivia.com/convictions/histoire/  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/midas  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/norauto-franchise  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/feu-vert 3.3. Data collection The growing tendency towards non-financial reporting has led to the generation of many documents (Montecchia et al., 2016). We collected data from multiple and complementary sources which provide a holistic view of franchisors’ CSD: the websites of the chains, the websites of the groups when chains belonged to a group, the non-financial information of their annual report if they publish any, and the recent press articles on these chains when information was related to CSR practices.  In order to be as exhaustive, reliable and precise as possible, we relied on an analysis grid stemming from the French government. Indeed, the Article 225 of the “Grenelle II” Law establishes the rules for producing reports and the information to be included in these reports. Companies over a certain size (i.e., more than 500 employees and 40 million euros in sales or 20 million euros in total assets for publicly-listed companies, and more than 500 employees and 100 million euros in sales or total assets for non-listed companies) have to issue non-financial reports and “comply or explain” why they cannot disclose an information. Article 225 lists 42 items split into three main categories in favor of sustainable development: environmental information, social information and societal information (see Table 1). All data collected were classified in this analysis grid by two of the researchers to limit interpretation bias.  << Table 1 to insert here >> 4. Findings Franchise chains are increasingly well structured to address CSR-specific challenges. Some franchisors developed committees dedicated to this particular purpose. For instance, the Mobivia Group, operating the Midas and Norauto brands, appointed a “Sustainable                                                             https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0095 Development Committee […] to ensure that the actions and projects of companies in the Mobivia ecosystem are in line with an ambitious Sustainable Development strategy leading to the creation of shared economic value and a positive social, environmental and societal contribution”. This statement highlights the multidisciplinary nature of franchise chains’ CSD, which can focus on either environmental, social or societal aspects. We found information related to all 42 items of our grid, which confirms this diversity of franchisors’ CSR practices.  4.1. Environmental information Our sampled franchisors appeared to be particularly concerned by their environmental impact. In fact, we found information on all 14 environmental items of the grid, thus highlighting the wide range of activities in which they are involved. Some franchisors, like Midas and Norauto through the Mobivia Group, sought to promote their commitment and continuous improvement by obtaining high environmental value certification such as ISO 14001, that assess environmental management through cross internal audits on every Norauto centers of the group. This emphasizes that franchisors tend to exceed legal requirements in terms of environmental commitment.  Moreover, we observed that the success of franchise chains’ environmental practices relies on various stakeholders, which is consistent with previous research on CSD (e.g., Perrigot et al., 2015; Perrigot et al., 2021). First of all, franchisors can educate their employees in order to reduce resource consumption and contribute to the chain’s sustainable strategy. To this end, the Beaumanoir Group has developed a training program specifically for purchasing teamsFranchisors can also involve their customers by sensitizing and informing them about                                                             https://www.mobivia.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/DPEF-2019-2020.pdf  https://www.mobivia.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/DPEF-2019-2020.pdf  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf sustainable practices. For instance, the Beaumanoir Group’s brands “are making their customers aware of the role they can play to better preserve water when they wash their products”. They provide their customers with “recommendations for taking care of products while preserving the planet [that] are included on [their] care labels”. Moreover, the mitigation of externalities generated by customers seems to be important for franchisors, as illustrated by B&B Hôtels’ implementation of “chargers for electric cars” to allow customers to “recharge their vehicles for free”. Such a measure encourages the use of electric vehicles and, consequently, limits the environmental impacts resulting from fossil fuel consumption. In addition, franchisors can base their environmental activities on innovative partnerships which may first be tested in company-owned units, and once they have proven to be successful, implemented in franchised units. We can mention, in particular, the Le Duff Group, which “launched a pilot test of the Too Good To Go mobile application in Brioche Dorée units in France to combat food waste by selling baskets filled with the day's unsold items at reduced prices”. In light of its success, this solution was then extended to all company-owned units and probably to numerous franchisees attracted by the Too Good To Go concept. As a matter of fact, franchisees are considered the cornerstone of the chain’s sustainable actions, as pointed out by the Accor Group, which “has made commitments to combat food waste, the consumption of non-renewable resources and the reduction of its contribution to water stress, the achievement of which depends largely on its partners, particularly hotel owners”Finally, franchise chains can engage in collective actions with other companies, sometimes even competitors, sharing common interests in the area of CSR. This can be illustrated by the                                                             https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://www.hotel-bb.com/fr/entreprise-durable-rse  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2019/08/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2019/08/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf Beaumanoir Group, which decided to sign the Fashion Pact along with more than 60 other companies in the fashion industry, thus committing “to curbing global warming, restoring biodiversity and protecting the oceans, and to implementing concrete actions in their respective organizations”. Some of these visible actions can in fact be explained by regulation theory since franchisors’ motivations may stem from a willingness to promote their chain’s commitment and therefore avoid future coercive regulations (Leung & Snell, 2017; 2021; Perrigot et al., 2015; Perrigot et al., 2021). << Table 2 to insert here >> 4.2. Social information The second category of CSR-related information disclosed by franchisors refers to social practices. Again, the franchisors in our sample report on a variety of activities that cover all 18 items in our grid. First, franchisors can emphasize the positive outcomes stemming from the duplication of their concepts in territories where their units are located. The Accor Group, for example, placed a strong emphasis on diversity, which is why “women represent 43% of the workforce and 34% of hotel managers, in company-owned, under management contract and franchised hotels” of its brands. It should be further noted that the Accor Group overwhelmingly relies on partnerships (i.e., franchising and management contracts) rather than company ownership to expand its chains, given that partners employ about 94% of the group’s total workforce (280,000 employees)                                                            https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf Second, franchisors can promote the evolution and career advancement of employees working in their chains. For example, 20% of La Mie Câline’s franchisees “come from the network”Internal mobility can also be promoted through employee training, which is why all Le Duff “group’s companies have set up structured integration and training programs” and “the Group's head office is recognized as a Training Organization […], enabling it to deliver qualifying training programs”. This training policy is even more relevant given that franchisors have a contractual obligation to transfer their know-how and therefore train their franchisees. Third, franchisors can improve the working and living conditions of both their employees and franchisees’ employees in several ways. With this in mind, the Accor Group has “defined a global compensation policy for employees at its headquarters and in its company-owned and under management contract hotels”, which “is adapted to the specific practices of each country”. Moreover, these adaptations to local culture and customs are essential to employee well-being. International franchisors are then particularly vigilant in this regard. As an example, Kamps (the Le Duff Group’s chain located in Germany) allows remote working and flexible hours for its employees as well as “special days dedicated to health, paid for by the company's mutual insurance company”. Another major challenge for franchisors is the safety of employees working within their chain. This concern is of paramount importance since franchisors must ensure that the safety of employees working in their units, regardless of the organizational form (i.e., franchised, under a management contract, company-owned), is not compromised. For this purpose, the Accor Group has set up an alert line “accessible 24/7 in 29                                                             https://www.lamiecaline.com/fr/enseigne-restauration-rapide/environnement  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf languages and […] scheduled to be opened to employees of other under management contract and franchised hotels”Fourth, franchisors can contribute to an improved social climate by implementing equal treatment policies within their chains. Such policies might focus specifically on recruiting and including people with disabilities. Feu Vert insisted on maintaining “a 3.5% hiring rate of disabled personnel, above the national average in the private sector” owing to “a proactive policy to promote the integration of disabled persons by giving them a full place within the company”, while accompanying each new employee with a disability through a dedicated mentorship. Nevertheless, not all franchisors are as successful as Feu Vert in including workers with disabilities. Indeed, the Accor Group disclosed employing 2,094 individuals with a recognized disability in its company-owned and under management contract hotels, which accounts for only 1% of its total workforce. The Beaumanoir Group participates twice a year in the Hello Handicap virtual recruitment fair, which each time allows recruiting several people. Although this approach has positive implications, it merely offers temporary work contracts that do not provide long-term employment for disabled personnel. In addition, these equal treatment policies can be oriented towards other populations, such as ethnic minorities. This is notably the case for Accor, where “each country in which the Group operates is implementing an action plan based on local discrimination issues. In Australia, for example, specific programs have been implemented to promote the inclusion of Aboriginals”<< Table 3 to insert here >>                                                             https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://www.feuvert-entreprises.fr/a-propos/developpement-durable-et-responsable/  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf 4.3. Societal information The franchisors selected for the purpose of our study disclosed information regarding various societal-oriented actions implemented within their chain. Indeed, whether it concerned territorial impact, philanthropy, relationships with suppliers or human rights, their determination to address societal challenges seemed to be particularly strong, as evidenced by the fact that we found information covering all the items of our grid (i.e., 9 out of 9). Through their geographic expansion, franchise chains can exert a positive impact on the dynamism and economic activity of the territories where they choose to locate units. As an example regarding Del Arte (belonging to the Le Duff Group), “for each franchisee or company-owned restaurant opening (between 10 and 25 openings per year), an average of 20 jobs are created locally, for which the company favors permanent contracts”. The Le Duff Group further explained that “local recruitment is done in conjunction with local partners: Pôle Emploi [employment office], schools and training centers, hotel schools, etc.”. In addition, franchise chains can create indirect jobs by collaborating with local producers or suppliers. This is the case for Bridor (the Le Duff Group’s brand supplying Brioche Dorée units), which purchases all of its flour from local millers operating close to its production site. In fact, agency theory has demonstrated that franchisees usually have a better knowledge of their local territory and are more committed than company-owned unit managers to expanding their business (Combs & Ketchen, 2003). Franchisors therefore have an incentive to recruit franchisee candidates who share common values, in order to maximize positive impacts and strengthen the effectiveness of their CSR actions.                                                              https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf Franchise chains’ social-oriented actions can also play out at a broader level, i.e., nationally or internationally, though philanthropy for instance. This is indeed the case for Feu Vert, which initiated a partnership with the NGO “Children of the Mekong”, in donating some of its profits to finance the education of young children in South AsiaFurthermore, franchisors seem to be particularly cautious regarding the societal impacts associated with their purchasing policies. As Ekyog pointed out, they “pay great importance to the origin of the materials used to make [their] sustainable clothing” and “know precisely the conditions of culture and harvest (organic agriculture, reasoned...)”. For its part, the Beaumanoir Group requires suppliers to sign their “Ethics Charter and therefore to commit to respecting [their] code of conduct and the social and environmental standards contained therein”. This prudence however can sometimes extend beyond selecting virtuous suppliers, as some franchisors also support suppliers’ efforts towards improving their social practices. In this regard, the Le Duff Group works with its suppliers “to build channels where animal welfare is a top priority”Moreover, franchise chains are attentive to their customers’ safety, not only in terms of health (e.g., Ekyog guaranteed “the absence of the use of any toxic or harmful substance”) but also with regard to the protection of their personal data. As such, the Accor Group implemented new measures in 2019 to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These include a “review of the clauses governing the use of personal data in franchise and management contracts” as well as the creation “of a toolkit for hotels to develop and deploy their compliance programs”. This last point is of interest since it implies franchisor know-how                                                             https://www.feuvert-entreprises.fr/a-propos/developpement-durable-et-responsable/  ekyog.com/la-marque/tracabilite.html  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.ekyog.com/la-marque/nos-engagements.html  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf which can be codified and transferred to franchisees. This know-how transmission can also be illustrated by the Accor Group’s commitment to provide “all hotels with awareness-raising kits including web series, e-learning and video learning” in order to protect human rights. In fact, franchising facilitates a virtuous scaling mechanism that magnifies the impacts of CSR actions at both the franchisor and franchisee levels. << Table 4 to insert here >> 5. Discussion 5.1. Contributions to the theory Our research builds on the literature on CSR in franchise chains, and more specifically from the CSD viewpoint. Findings show that our eight sampled franchisors disclose extensive information on their CSR activities. According to the typology built by Sebastiani et al. (2014), most of our franchisors can thus be considered as True Blues engaged in numerous social and environmental sustainable practices and seeking to develop relationships with both internal and external stakeholders.  Moreover, we observed that the groups operating several franchise chains, i.e., Accor, Beaumanoir, Le Duff and Mobivia, tend to disclose more CSR-related information than the other chains. These findings are consistent with Resource Theory (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), according to which franchisors’ resources will condition their commitment to CSR (Choi & Lee, 2018; Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012).  It also appears that larger chains, by virtue of belonging to a group, are more active with respect to CSR. This is in line with previous research that pointed the positive and significant impacts                                                             https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf of a chain’s size on its CSR commitment (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015). Furthermore, these groups were founded a long time ago, more than 40 years ago, thus contradicting the findings of Flores Villanueva and Gaytán Ramírez (2018), who observed that older franchisors were engaged in fewer CSR activities than younger ones.  In addition, we observed that chains for which CSR lies at the core of their business, e.g., Ekyog, disclose a considerable amount of CSR-related information, thereby confirming that aside from chain characteristics, other management-related characteristics may be major determinants of chains’ CSR activities (Sebastiani et al., 2014). Indeed, franchisors with substantial experience in CSR issues will tend to increase their chains’ CSR actions, as argued by Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012).  Lastly, bearing in mind the positive impact of CSR on brand image and performance (e.g., Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012), it should be noted that franchisors’ CSD practices may be less sincere than they appear and constitute a form of “greenwashing” or strategy to avoid new coercive regulations (Leung & Snell, 2017; 2021). Nevertheless, part of these limitations can be addressed by the fact that some franchisors’ CSD are output-oriented and hence refer to tangible and measurable CSR actions. 5.2. Contributions to the practice Our research contributes to the practice. First, by showing that all franchisors within our sample are actively pursuing CSR initiatives, our findings can encourage other franchisors to set up and implement CSR activities in their own chains and then communicate regarding these activities. CSR is no longer an option; it has become critical for franchise chains to reinforce their brand image, differentiate their brands and build long-term relationships with their stakeholders, i.e., franchisees, employees of franchisees, customers, suppliers, etc.  Then, our findings can help franchisors enrich the CSR-related content on their websites while strengthening their CSR commitment to other CSR-related activities. Our illustrations of the 42 grid items, within four different industries, serve as suggestions to franchisors at the beginning of the CSR engagement process.  Finally, our findings suggest that franchisors seek to involve all their stakeholders in their CSR activities, in particular their franchisees at the local level. For instance, the Accor Group “has decided to set up a hotline dedicated to Ethics, Compliance, Health and Safety, Human Rights and the Environment […] scheduled to be opened to employees of other under management contract and franchised hotels in 2020”. To get the support of franchisees in implementing CSR activities at the local level, franchisors must “think CSR” from the very beginning of the franchise relationship, that is from the time of franchisee candidate selection. Franchisors select new franchisees according to several criteria, including financial resources, previous experience and knowledge of local markets (e.g., Clarkin & Swavely, 2006; Jambulingam & Nevin, 1999). In addition to these factual indicators, shared values must be taken into consideration (El Akremi et al., 2012). If franchisee candidates are found to have an interest in environmental preservation, diversity and inclusion, it will then be easier to collaborate on CSR projects over the whole period covered by the franchise contract.  Moreover, CSR practices can be integrated into franchisor know-how, both organizational and business know-how. Franchisors can develop organizational know-how, i.e., capabilities and competencies (Perrigot et al., 2020) over time, through different ways: recruitment of CSR experts at the chain headquarters, conduction of benchmarks on best practices, cooperation with stakeholders. This organizational know-how will indirectly benefit the franchisees, and directly benefit them if franchisors are able to transfer a part of it as business know-how (Perrigot et al.,                                                             https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf 2017). Franchisors could in fact insert into the operations manual a number of processes that for instance deal with waste management and use of local products in the restaurant industry, customer incentives to return empty perfume bottles in the cosmetics sector, or responses to the specific needs of disabled employees. This codification of CSR know-how would serve to facilitate implementation in the units. 5.3. Limits and tracks for future research Our research has some limitations and open avenues for future research. Firstly, we focused on CSD only, i.e., franchisor communication regarding their CSR actions but not the actions themselves as they are implemented in practice at the chain headquarters as well as in the franchised units and company-owned units (if any). Although this approach provides an accurate overview of the CSR information accessible to franchisors' stakeholders, further research could explore CSD or CSR practices through in-depth interviews conducted with franchisors, franchisees, franchisee candidates, employees and consumers. In particular, more research is needed on the implementation of CSR activities across the three dimensions: environment (e.g., green practices), social (e.g., diversity) and societal (e.g., relationships with suppliers). Such research is currently underway, green practices and waste management in the fast food sector (Perrigot et al., 2021), and the inclusion of disabled employees in the hospitality and service industries (Le Bot & Perrigot, 2021). Future research should be extended to other industries, such as clothing, cosmetics and homecare services, where franchising is also widespread.  Secondly, our empirical research is based on a multiple case study approach, hence findings cannot be generalized. Examining the website content of all chains within a same industry might prove to be a relevant approach. Thirdly, even though we used a grid to analyze the content of franchisor websites and reports, interpretation issues could be raised. Lastly, we focused on France where there are many regulations on CSR and CSD (NER Law, “Grenelle II” Law, PACTE Law – 2019 - allowing companies to define a “raison d’être” and to change status in a “benefit corporation”), comparing franchisor CSD across several countries could allow taking the regulatory impact into consideration (Jackson et al., 2020). To conclude, our findings show that franchisors report rich and diversified information on their sustainable practices, in response to regulation and Society pressures. More research is needed in CSR reporting, as well as CSR practices, in the specific case of franchising. \n",

Dr Tess Hardy Associate Professor Melbourne Law School University of Melbourne Melbourne, Victoria, 3003 Australia Telephone: +613 8344 2590 Email : tess.hardy@unimelb.edu.au Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 24-26, 2021 Work Health and Safety in Franchise Networks: A Regulatory Hot Potato? Abstract Prior to the arrival of the COVID-19 in early 2020, the challenges of promoting compliance with work health and safety () obligations in franchise networks had been largely overlooked in mainstream media and public commentary. The pandemic has refocused attention on the health and safety risks faced by frontline workers in casual or insecure work arrangements, including within franchise networks. Ensuring WHS obligations are met is essential not just for preventing the spread of disease amongst workers, but for protecting the community at large. This paper considers the regulation of WHS in the context of franchise networks in Australia. The paper begins with a summary of studies which have attempted to identify and assess the health and safety risks posed by franchise networks, including economic pressures faced by franchisees, fractured lines of responsibility and the characteristics of workers engaged in much franchise work. The paper then considers the harmonized work health and safety legislation in Australia and the way in which this unique statutory scheme maps onto franchise networks. Next, the paper surveys some of the key cases in this area to assess how courts approach the difficult task of ascribing liability for health and safety contraventions occurring in franchise networks. In concluding, the paper identifies possible lines for future research regarding the effective regulation of WHS in franchise networks. Key words: Health and safety; employment; work; COVID-19 INTRODUCTION Since systemic underpayment was revealed at 7-Eleven, tackling wage theft in franchise networks has dominated many inquiries and driven much law reform. In comparison, the difficulties of promoting compliance with work health and safety () obligations in franchise networks have been largely neglected in the public debate. However, this has started to shift since the arrival of COVID-19. The pandemic has refocused attention on the health and safety risks faced by frontline workers in flexible or fissured work arrangements because this has ‘made disease prevention and suppression more difficult.’Indeed, early in the pandemic, 14 McDonald’s outlets in Melbourne were forced to close, and 1000 employees were stood down, as a result of workplace transmission risks. Similar concerns were raised by McDonald’s workers across the globe.Issues such as inadequate staff training, the insufficient supply or use of personal protective equipment and fears associated with reporting injuries and illnesses when employment is precarious have all been brought to the fore. It has become clear that ensuring WHS obligations are met within the workplace is essential not just for preventing the spread of disease amongst workers, but for protecting the community at large. It is also evident that  Allyson O’Connor, Trevor Peckham and Noah Seixas, ‘Considering Work Arrangement as an “Exposure” in Occupational Health Research and Practice’ (2020) 8 Public Health 363.

Fowler (n 3).  the health and safety of workers may be compromised in fragmented employment arrangements, such as franchise networks, due to economic pressures, blurred lines of responsibility and key characteristics of franchisees and franchise workers.  This paper considers the nature of health and safety risks in franchise networks in Australia and the regulatory response to these risks. The paper begins with a summary of studies which have attempted to analyse the health and safety risks posed by franchise networks, especially in key sectors, such as food retail. The paper then considers the harmonized work health and safety legislation in Australia and the way in which this unique statutory scheme maps onto franchise networks. Next, the paper surveys some of the key cases in this area to assess how courts approach the difficult task of ascribing liability for health and safety contraventions occurring in franchise networks. In conclusion, the paper underlines the need for improved data collection and further research about effective regulation of health and safety issues. HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES IN FRANCHISE NETWORKS: A SUMMARY Employment laws across many developed economies have traditionally been premised on two key assumptions. The first is that employees are generally vulnerable and in need of statutory protection beyond that afforded under the common law. Conversely, non-employees, including contractors, bailees and franchisees, are assumed to be less in need of elevated protections and the general law applicable to commercial arrangements is seen as appropriate. Second, employment laws are founded on the assumption of a unitary  Paul Harpur and Philip James, ‘The Shift in Regulatory Focus from Employment to Work Relationships: Critiquing Reforms to Australian and UK Occupational Safety and Health Laws’ (2014) 36 Comparative employer –  that is, ‘the same firm controls the site, manages the workers, bears the risks, and makes the profit.’ However, since the mid-1970s, both these assumptions have started to come undone in light of the global move away from stable, secure, full-time work towards temporary, insecure and casualised arrangements. Well before the current pandemic, it was evident that work arrangements have been ‘increasingly deviating from this standard conception of employment in contemporary labor markets.’Over the course of the past four decades, a range of studies have shown that non-standard work arrangements, a lack of job security and income inequality have had deleterious effects on occupational and public health. Non-standard work has been associated with higher injury frequency rates, greater injury severity, more hazard exposures and poor mental health. These arrangements have also been found to threaten the capacity of workers to obtain essential information, receive critical training, be fitted with appropriate PPE, control their working time and/or participate in WHS more generally.  Quinlan has argued that these adverse outcomes may be due, in part, to the fact that competitive pressures induce firms to not just adopt fragmented business models, but to Labour Law and Policy Journal 111, 111. See generally Richard Johnstone and Richard Mitchell, ‘Regulating Work’ in Christine Parker, Colin Scott, Nicola Lacey and John Braithwaite (eds) Regulating  (2004) 101.  Leslie Boden, Emily Spieler and Gregory Wagner, ‘The Changing Structure of Work: Implications for Workplace Health and Safety in the US’ (Paper prepared for the Future of Work Symposium, US Department of Labor, 9-11 December 2015).

Reviewing Research and Policy Debates on the OHS Effects of Outsourcing and Home-Based Work’ (2008)International Journal of Health Services 489. take risks when it comes to WHS. This may lead to underbidding on contracts, a failure to properly maintain equipment, a decrease in staff levels, limited training or a reduction in supervision and monitoring. Boden, Spieler and Wagner have observed that the factors ‘that produce lower wages and wage and hour violations may also result in cutting corners on providing a safe and healthy workplace.’ In support of this contention, they point to an earlier study undertaken by Filer and Golbe, which found that serious violations of OSHA standards were inversely related to firms’ operating margin.These issues are further exacerbated by blurred lines of responsibility which can lead to chaotic or disorganized work processes. As O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas point out, shared or confused responsibility ‘over who is required…to provide training and personal protective equipment or report work-related incidents leaves workers vulnerable.’ Where fissuring has led to the shedding of employment by larger firms to smaller, subsidiary firms – whether via franchising or otherwise – these smaller employers are often less capable of managing WHS risks effectively. These problems are further magnified in sectors where workers are vulnerable in one or several respects – for example, temporary migrant workers moving from job to job may have less control over working time, less agency to pursue a complaint and less capacity to access a union. Finally, Quinlan points out that precarious workers are afforded weaker protection under occupational health and safety legislation,  Michael Quinlan, ‘The Effects of Non-standard Forms of Employment on Worker Health and Safety’ (Discussion Paper No. 67, International Labour Organisation, 2015) 3-13.  RK Filer and DL Golbe, ‘Debt, Operating Margin, and Investment in Workplace Safety’ (2003) 51 The Journal of Industrial Economics 359.  O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas (n 1) 4. See also J Howard, ‘Non-Standard Work Arrangements and Worker Health and Safety’ (2016) 60 American Journal of Industrial Medicine  Boden, Spieler and Wagner (n 6) 24. as well as workers’ compensation laws. In addition, O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas have pointed out that workers in non-standard arrangements may lack access to benefits, such as paid sick leave, which may lead those workers to work while sick or injured. As the pandemic has shown, sickness presenteeism has a range of negative health consequences, including increased risk of injury to the worker, and potentially exposing co-workers, customers and the general public to infection. In short, the existing research suggests that fissured work arrangements have a multitude of ‘implications for worker health and safety by potentially intensifying existing hazards or creating new ones within the workplace’and WHS regulation ‘has been slow to adjust to these changing work patterns.’So far, however, there have been very few published studies which have specifically or separately analysed the impact of franchising on WHS. A notable exception is the study conducted by the Young Workers’ Centre in 2018, which surveyed around 370 young workers about their experiences of health and safety within franchises. This survey revealed that 65% of young franchise workers feel bullied, unsafe or uncomfortable at work. This is partly due to the fact that many young employees are required to work alone in franchises during unsociable hours (such as early in the morning late at night) without adequate support or supervision to keep them safe. Survey respondents reported that perceptions of vulnerability were elevated in particular situations, such as when they were handling cash or where they were serving customers who may be affected by drugs or  Quinlan 2015 (n 11).  O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas (n 1), 3.  Richard Johnstone, ‘Regulating Work Health and Safety in Multilateral Business Arrangements’ (2019) Australian Journal of Labour Law 41, 42.   Boden, Spieler and Wagner (n 6) 14. alcohol. In addition, 40% of young franchise workers reported that they or a co-worker had suffered a physical injury at work. The most common involved burns (41%), cuts (29%) and falls, slips or trips (15%). This survey also found that while franchisor representatives frequently visited their workplace, these representatives were far mor focused on store presentation (89%) than whether staff had completed relevant training (40%).  The findings of the Australian survey echo other studies undertaken in the United States. For example, the National Employment Law Project found that in a period of three years ending in April 2019, the media had reported on more than 700 incidents of workplace violence at McDonald’s stores across the US, including shootings, robberies, sexual assaults and other forms of harassment and abuse. This analysis – which considered violent incidents reported in the media, violence data from two cities, and interviews with current and former McDonald’s workers – found that McDonald’s long hours of operation routinely expose workers to risk due to high levels of violence associated with late night retail (between 10pm and 4am). The report argued that by failing to provide sufficient training to staff or adopting violence hazard controls, such as cash handling procedures and panic buttons, McDonald’s was not complying with its ‘legal and moral duty to provide employees a safe work environment.’ An earlier national study of health and safety conditions in the restaurant industry in the US found that more than 95% of workers had either been cut or burned on the job; almost 25% came into contact with toxic chemicals at  National Employment Law Project, Behind the Arches – How McDonald’s Fails to Protect Workers from Workplace Violence (May 2019).  their place of work; over 87% did not get paid sick leave; and 64% cooked and served food while sick.REGULATION OF WORK HEALTH AND SAFETY IN AUSTRALIA From the 1970s onwards, comprehensive WHS statutes were enacted at Commonwealth, state and territory levels, seeking to prevent and address the occurrence of work-related injury and disease. Although the legislation in all these jurisdictions ‘were broadly consistent in approach, there were many differences in matters of detail’. One of the common features was a desire to extend protections which were ordinarily confined to common law employees to other types of workers who lay outside the employment paradigm. For example, section 21 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (Vic) required the employer to provide information, supervision and training to non-employees, such as independent contractors and their employees. In addition, sections 22-23 imposed duties on employers and self-employed persons to persons who were not employees, such as customers and passers-by. This broad duty to ‘others’ was designed to extend protections to a range of different business models, including franchisees and their employees and contractors.The Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, Serving While Sick: High Risks and Low Benefits for the Nation’s Restaurant Workforce, and Their Impact on the Consumer (September 2010) < https://chapters.rocunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/reports_serving-while-sick_full.pdf>.  As at 2011, prior to the wide-scale harmonisation of WHS legislation in Australia, the principal Occupational Health and Safety Acts in force were: Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth); Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW); Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Qld); Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Act 1986 (SA); Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Tas); Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic); Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (WA); Work Safety Act 2008 (ACT); and Workplace Health and Safety Act 2007 (NT).  Andrew Stewart et al, Creighton and Stewart’s Labour Law (Federation Press, 6 ed, 2016) 541.   See Richard Johnstone, ‘Paradigm Crossed? The Statutory Occupational Health and Safety Obligations of the Business Undertaking’ (1999) 12 Australian Journal of Labour Law 73. From 2008, there was a desire, and concerted effort, to ‘harmonise’ the disparate legislative frameworks with the aim of having a single, uniform law applicable across all nine jurisdictions. These efforts culminated in the publication of a Model Work Health and Safety Bill in 2010. By 2012, all jurisdictions, except Victoria and Western Australia, had enacted WHS Acts adopting the terms of the Model WHS Bill.In stark comparison to the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act), the harmonised work health and safety legislation ‘no longer normalises the employment relationship as a starting point of regulation’. Instead, under the WHS Acts, ‘primary’ responsibility is placed on ‘a person conducting a business or undertaking’ to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of ‘workers’ and ‘other persons’. The definition of a ‘person conducting a business or undertaking’ – colloquially referred to as a PCBU – includes not just employers, but also principal contractors, head contractors, occupiers and franchisors, amongst others. Unlike the secondary liability provisions of the FW Act or the US concept of ‘joint employment’, there is no requirement to show that the PCBU has ‘control’ over the work. Harpur and James observe that the WHS Acts are deliberately geared towards a more expansive form of business regulation ‘that serves to limit the extent to which the  See, eg, Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth), Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW); Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Qld), Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (ACT); Work Health and Safety (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011 (NT); Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (SA); and Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (Tas).

WHS Acts, s 19(1)-(2).  WHS Acts, s 5 of WHS Acts See also Explanatory Memorandum, Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 (Cth), [23].   Johnstone 2019 (n 17) 48. application of health and safety duties are decisively shaped by the corporate veil, corporate structures and physical location.’Similarly, the term ‘worker’ under the harmonized WHS Acts is exceptionally wide. In particular, this term is defined under the WHS legislation as including any person who carries out ‘work in any capacity for’ a PCBU, including work as: a contractor; a sub-contractor; an employee of a labour hire company; an outworker; and as a volunteer.Further, as Johnstone points out, this definition only requires the worker to work for PCBU – in other words, it expressly contemplates the fact that here may be more than one PCBU and there is no requirement for the worker to work for the PCBU who owes the s 19(1) duty.The broad scope of these provisions and the potential way in which they might apply to a franchise arrangement was described by Johnstone et al as follows: As the franchise arrangement is part of the franchisor’s business, a franchisor will owe the primary duty in s 19(1) to the franchisee, to the franchisee’s employee, and to all “workers” (for example, contractors and subcontractors) engaged by the franchisee. And even if such parties are not found to be “workers” “engaged”, “influenced” or “directed” by the franchisor, they will be “other persons” who might be “put at risk from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking”. Harpur and James (n 5) 123.  WHS Acts, s 7.   Johnstone 2019 (n 17) 46.  Johnstone et al (n 25) 167. Importantly, the WHS Acts contain provisions which are designed to address what is sometimes referred to as ‘counterproductive liability avoidance’ – that is, where firms seek to recalibrate their contracting relationships to avoid being defined as an employer or further reduce the extent to which they monitor a franchisee’s practices. Rather, the WHS legislation is crafted in a way that seeks to encourage firms to respond with the ‘right kind of liability avoidance’, that is, by taking additional, voluntary measures to minimise the relevant legal risks, including closer monitoring of contractors, increased investment in training and skills or reintegrating the work back into the core organisation. To achieve this objective, the legislation provides that: a) the relevant duties cannot be delegated; b) one person can owe a number of duties; and c) more than one person can hold a duty, and each person must comply with the duty even though it might be also owed by others.Together, these provisions mean that both the franchisor and the franchisee owe primary duties concurrently to the franchisee’s workers and contractors, and to members of the public. A related aspect of the WHS Acts is the way in which they impose a horizontal duty on all PCBUs to consult, cooperate and coordinate with other PCBUs. Again, this provision is specifically designed to address the ‘problem of hazards arising from fractured, complex and disorganised work processes.’ This horizontal duty requires, for example,  Cynthia Estlund, ‘Who Mops the Floor at the Fortune 500? Corporate Self-Regulation and the Low Wage Workplace’ (2008) 12(3) Lewis & Clark Law Review 671, 692.  Ibid.  Ibid.  WHS Acts, s 14.  WHS Acts, s 15.  WHS Acts, s 16.  WHS Acts, s 46.

Australian Labour Regulation and the Fissured Workplace’ (2015) 37 Comparative Labor Law & Policy Journal 55, 59. that the franchisor and the franchisee consult, cooperate and coordinate activities so far as is reasonably practicable. In addition, there is a ‘vertical’ duty for a PCBU to consult with workers (or their health and safety representative) who carry out work for the business or undertaking and who are, or are likely to be, directly affected by a WHS matter. To satisfy this obligation, franchisors and franchisees must, so far as is reasonably practicable, consult all the workers working for the franchisee.Finally, the WHS Acts place a ‘positive and proactive duty’ on each officer of each PCBU ‘to exercise due diligence’ to ensure that the PCBU complies with all relevant duties and obligations arising under the Act. An officer can be prosecuted for a failure to exercise proper due diligence, even if the PCBU itself is not breaching its own duties.In summary, the WHS Acts are explicitly designed to ‘protect all workers in all kinds of work arrangements arising from new and changing business models, and from all kinds of existing and emerging hazards.’ In doing so, the Acts arm the state-based WHS inspectorates with a ‘rare regulatory tool to prompt a systematic approach from the top of the structure’. This is very much in line with idealized models of enforcement, such as  Johnstone et al (n 25) 167.   WHS Acts, s 47.  Ibid.  Section 27(5) of each of the WHS Acts defines ‘due diligence’ to include taking ‘reasonable steps’ to do the following, amongst other things: to acquire and keep up-to-date knowledge of work health and safety matters; to gain an understanding of the nature of the PCBU’s operations and generally of the hazards and risks associated with these operations; and to ensure that the PCBU has, and implements, processes for complying with any duty or obligation under the Act.   See s 27(4) of WHS Acts.  Johnstone 2019 (n 17).  Ibid 58.  David Weil’s approach of ‘strategic enforcement.’ However, as Johnstone laments, there has been very little evidence of WHS regulators taking a proactive, creative or strategic approach to regulating WHS risks in franchise networks, and other multilateral business arrangements.INSIGHTS FROM CASE LAW CONCERNED WITH WHS ISSUES The novelty of the harmonised WHS provisions, together with the fact that they are still relatively new, means that it is not entirely clear how these provisions will play out, and how liability will be ascribed in the context of franchise networks. Although key provisions have changed under the WHS Acts, some of the prosecutions brought under predecessor legislation are still instructive in in showing how regulators are likely to frame the prosecution’s case, and how courts may potentially respond.  While the number of cases which deal with WHS offences within franchise systems are limited in number, the bulk of decisions involving franchises tend to focus exclusively on the failures of the employer at law, which is typically the franchisee. For example, in Safework NSW v QSR Pty Ltd a young worker engaged at a KFC site run by a multi-unit franchisee was injured after stepping in hot oil. While the franchisee was convicted and fined $60,000 for a breach of s 19(1), the franchisor was not named as a defendant. Further,  David Weil, Improving Workplace Conditions through Strategic Enforcement: A Report to the Wage and Hour Division (Report, Boston University, May 2010).  Johnstone 2019 (n 17) 58.   In extensive searches across all relevant legal databases and WHS websites, 21 cases were identified as involving work health and safety related contraventions in franchise networks. This is unlikely to be comprehensive or exhaustive and it is quite possible that other cases have been decided in this context. However, it is very difficult to trace the case law in this area due to a lack of published decisions.  [2019] NSWDC 67. to the extent that the court referred to the role of the franchisor, it was in positive terms. A similar approach was adopted in Boland v Balhahn Pty Ltd t/as Balhannah Mitre 10 In this case, which was brought after two employees of a Mitre 10 franchisee were injured while at work, the court was squarely concerned with the failures of the franchisee (which had no safe system of work for moving stock with forklifts). The court made no comment or observation regarding the duties or role of the franchisor in this respect. Franchisors have generally only been held liable for WHS contraventions occurring at company-owned units – that is, where they own and operate the relevant site. This was the case in both DPP v Hungry Jacks, Visy & Veolia and Boland v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty LtdThere are, however, two  notable cases which depart from this general trend where the court has found that the franchisor has breached their statutory duty as a person who has ‘control’ of a place of work (which was a narrower provision relevant under the predecessor legislation before the harmonised WHS Acts came into effect). In Inspector Estreich v Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd the franchisor of a mobile hose repair business –  [2017] SAET 112.  A similar approach was adopted in a string of WHS cases brought against the franchisee as direct employer: see Campbell v H&T Cook Enterprises and Cook [2020] SAET 241; Osborne Park Commercial Pty Ltd v Miloradovic [2019] WASCA 17; Wyatt v MR & RC Smith Pty Ltd [2010] WADC 178; Terra Firma (Newcastle) Pty Limited t/as “Amber Tiles Newcastle Limited” v Margaret Smith and Philmar Investments (Newcastle) Pty Ltd [2009] NSWWCCPD 145; Glen Rowe v Q-COMP [2009] QIRComm 9; Barnett v Domino’s Pizza Australia New Zealand Limited [2007] SAIRC 2; Erindale M Pty Ltd v Curran [2004] ACTSC 69; Inspector Barbosa v McDonald’s Australia Limited [2003] NSWIRComm 196; and Inspector Louise May v McDonald’s Australia Limited [2002] NSWIRComm 179.  [2018] VCC 1454. In this case, a person was killed, and another injured, when they were struck by a large recycling bin that was being emptied at a Hungry Jacks store. This store was owned and operated by the franchisor and they were ultimately prosecuted and fined for breach of s 23(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Cth) as the direct employer.  [2017] SAIRC 16. Here, the franchisor was fined for breaching s 19(1) of the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (SA) after an employee was injured (when they fell into a container of hot oil) at a site owned and operated by the franchisor (who was effectively the direct employer in this case).  See WorkCover Authority of NSW v McDonald’s Australia Limited & Anor [2000] NSWIRComm 277.   [2011] NSWIRComm 11. Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd – was fined $110,000 for breaching s 10(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW). In this case, an employee of the franchisee – Maintenance & Contracting Pty Ltd () – had been injured when one of the gas cylinders in the truck he was driving unexpectedly exploded. The truck had been supplied by Parker Hannifin to the franchisee as part of its franchise arrangement. The truck’s ventilation system did not comply with the relevant Australian Standards for vehicles carrying flammable gases. In addition, the franchise agreement required MCP to comply with all Parker Hannifin’s operating procedures, including an OH&S procedure. However, there was no express operating procedure relating to ventilation requirements for vehicles. In assessing the serious of the offence, Haylen J observed that the franchisor had fundamentally misunderstood its OHS obligations to its franchisees which was not a view reached by taking advice on the subject but was basically an assumption made because of the fact that the Hose Doctor franchises were independent businesses who had been sub-contracted to perform service functions using the defendant's product. It is difficult to accept that these matters should reduce the seriousness of the offence. The defendant was a well-developed corporation with, admittedly, a comprehensive safety system mainly in relation to its own employees and in relation to the use to be made of its products but it had neglected to make safety arrangements concerning the operation of the Hose Doctor franchises who were a significant part of the manner in which the defendant undertook its business. Even a superficial review of the many occupational health and safety prosecutions dealt with in this part of the Court's jurisdiction would have quickly shown that the Court had consistently and frequently drawn attention to the fact that occupational health and safety obligations could not be delegated and especially could not be delegated to sub-contractors, even though those arrangements might have widened the field of persons to whom the defendant had obligations in relation to the safety of the people involved. This legislation has now been repealed. Inspector Estreich v Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd [2011] NSWIRComm 11 [21]. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v McDonald’s Australia Limited and Another,the franchisor was fined a total of $270,000 for breaching ss 17(1)(a) and (b) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW). In this case, an employee working at a franchisee-owned outlet was killed after being electrocuted while cleaning a grill at the restaurant. McDonald’s Australia Limited was prosecuted in its capacity as lessor of the premises where the incident occurred (under s 17(1)(a)) and as the franchisor (under s 17(1)(b)). Under the relevant franchise agreement, the franchisee was required to comply with every component of the McDonald’s system, including uniform specifications and facilities. The franchisor also specified the layout and design of the building, as well as fixtures and equipment of the restaurant. In assessing the appropriate penalty, Walton J pointed to the terms of the franchise agreement and the lease as the relevant sources of ‘control’ exerted by McDonald’s Australia over the franchisee. The judge went on to note that the control exercised by McDonald’s Australia was  was both direct and significant in determining the system of work (in relation to the cleaning and maintenance of grills) in the restaurant operated by Lyndhurst. Even though the employees were those of Lyndhurst and Lyndhurst retained at all relevant times obligations for the training of each person and the provision of a safe system of work, the system of work was substantially governed by the controls exercised by the first defendant [2000] NSWIRComm 277  Section 17(1)(a) of the NSW OSH Act provided that a person who has control of non-domestic premises which have been made available to persons (not being the person’s employees) as a place of work shall ensure that the premises are safe and without risks to health. Section 17(1)(b) provided that a person who has control of any plant in any non-domestic premises which have been provided for the use or operation of persons at work (not being the person’s employees) shall ensure that the plant is safe and without risks to health. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v McDonald’s Australia Limited and Another [2000] NSWIRComm 277 [197]. One of the most recent, and potentially most significant, cases relating to WHS issues is one that was not brought under the WHS legislation. In this case, the Retail and Fast Food Workers’ Union (RAFFWU) brought a civil remedy proceeding under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) against Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd (Tantex) – a multi-unit McDonald’s franchisee. In finding in favour of RAFFWU, Logan J held that Tantex’s assertion – via Facebook – that WHS laws do not provide workers with a right to have a drink or go to the toilet outside their scheduled 10-minute drink break amounted to misrepresentation, coercion and adverse action under the FW Act. The franchisee was ultimately fined $82,000 for the relevant breaches. In handing down the penalty, Logan J noted that  Employers need to be sensitive to that when a worker asserts a workplace right and not find comfort in that imbalance by not giving weight to the possibility that the worker might be right. On the whole of the evidence, I was left with the distinct impression that this had occurred in relation to Ms Staines’ [the manager’s] assertion. Even if one were disposed not to react to the assertions of an individual worker, the Union’s emphatic adoption of that same position and advocacy for it ought to have occasioned this and at least a careful, studied reading of the clause, if not the taking of advice. Tantex had multiple potential sources of such advice, either in-house from its human resources staff, from the franchisor or, based on its apparent financial resources, from external legal or industrial relations advisers.Following the decision on the merits of the case, the franchisor – McDonald’s Australia Pty Ltd – stated that the company continues to ‘work closely with our restaurants to ensure Retail and Fast Food Workers Union Incorporated v Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd [2020] FCA 1258 (31 August 2020).  Retail and Fast Food Workers Union Incorporated v Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2020] FCA 1644 (13 November 2020).   Ibid [46].  employees receive all the correct workplace entitlements and pay.’ The spokesperson for the franchisor also confirmed that the franchisee had implemented ‘processes to ensure ongoing compliance’ and that any other McDonald’s staff who might have queries should contact the ‘dedicated employee assistance hotline.’ The franchisor finished by saying that McDonald’s Australia remains ‘committed to working with our employees and franchisees to ensure any concerns are addressed.’However, the pandemic has raised a whole set of new WHS issues at McDonald’s, as well as other franchise networks. The fast food industry has been subject to a high level of scrutiny due to Victoria’s ‘McCluster’, where 12 COVID-19 cases were linked to one McDonald’s outlet in Fawkner. Subsequently, another 13 McDonald’s venues across Melbourne were shut down due to concerns about workplace transmission. Many of the regulatory challenges identified earlier in this paper – including a young workforce that was not properly trained or supervised – were cited as exacerbating WHS issues. The secretary of RAFFWU, Josh Cullinan, commented that:  At McDonald’s 80 per cent of their workforce is under 21. They’re not used to workplace safety precautions. When a manager says, go and work in the drive-through, it doesn’t occur to them to  wash their hands between every transaction, or they’re too nervous to mention it.However, the power of the franchisor to voluntarily shape WHS outcomes was demonstrated in July 2020 – when the second wave emerged in Victoria. Before the government mandated the wearing of masks, McDonald’s Australia announced that all  ‘McDonald’s operator threatened workers on Facebook: Court’, Workplace Express, 1 September 2020.  Fowler (n ?). employees across metropolitan Melbourne would be required to wear face masks ‘out of an abundance of caution.’CONCLUSION In light of the recent focus on WHS issues faced by frontline workers, such as those working in many fast food franchises, this paper has examined the evidence relating to WHS risks in franchise networks and the regulatory response to those risks. While there is substantial evidence to suggest that fissured work arrangements – such as subcontracting or labour hire – lead to adverse WHS outcomes, there are far fewer studies which have focused on the impact of franchising on health and safety. Further data on this issue would deepen our understanding of the regulatory challenges and opportunities presented by franchise networks when it comes to effective management of WHS issues. There remains much that we do not know in this regard. The harmonized WHS legislation represents a significant shift away from the dominant employment paradigm. The primary obligations of the WHS Acts are deliberately framed in an inclusive and expansive way and impose overlapping and concurrent duties on both franchisors and franchisees. Notwithstanding the ‘radical recasting’ of duties and obligations, the majority of decided cases tend to focus on breaches committed by the direct employer (i.e. the franchisee). The lack of cases, and the absence of direct intervention, has not necessarily prevented high profile franchisors, such as McDonald’s, from adopting a proactive approaching in managing WHS risks, particularly since the pandemic. Again,  Chanel Zagon, ‘McDonald’s staff required to wear face masks in Melbourne’, 9 News, 14 July 2020.  Johnstone 2019 (n 17). further research is required to assess whether, and to what extent, other franchise brands in other industry sectors are also taking voluntary steps to address WHS issues and what factors are driving these shifts in compliance behaviour.   \n",
      "Unstoppable scandals of Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. in South Korea Jean Jeon, PhD Associate Professor, Marketing College of Business University of Nevada, Reno / MS0028 Reno, Nevada 89557-0206 Office: 775.682.9166 Email: hjeon@unr.eduJohn Nolan, JD Lecturer, Management College of Business University of Nevada, Reno / MS0028 Reno, Nevada 89557-0206 Email: johnnolan@unr.eduInternational Society of Franchising 2021 Annual Conference Submitted March, 2021  Unstoppable scandals of Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. in South Korea Abstract Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. (hereafter “Namyang”) is one of the largest dairy manufacturers in South Korea (Dairy Market News Letter 2020). Namyang has franchised its dairy distribution system. In 2013, three former and current franchisees alleged that Namyang’ engaged in unreasonable coercion to purchase dairy products (i.e., “mireonaegi” in Korea) and coercion to provide benefits. Even though the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act in South Korea prohibits coercion of transactions and abuse of superior bargaining position, mireonaegi had been a well-established convention in franchising. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Korea found a legal advisory opinion that showed the illegality of excessive mireonaegi when investigating Namyang The Korea Fair Trade Commission also found evidence that supported franchisees’ allegations and imposed a penalty of 12.3 billion KRW (10.9 million USD). However, two years later the company filed a lawsuit for denying the illegality of unreasonable coercion to purchase dairy products to its franchisees. Since 2013, consumers continued to boycott Namyang’s products. The company has never recovered its sales in the dairy industry in South Korea. Recently, the company proposed a resolution to the commission to improve its relationships and business practices with franchisees.  Learning Outcomes Students will:  understand the nature of monopoly regulation and fair trade practices evaluate business practices explain both legal and social consequences of companies’ wrongdoings suggest branding and promotional strategies Application This case would be appropriate for undergraduate students who study franchising, distribution channels, reputation, and business ethics. Key Words Franchising, Reputation, Boycott, Dairy Industry, South Korea The authors developed the case for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of the situation. The case was anonymously peer reviewed for presentation at the 34th Annual ISoF Conference – Virtual Conference, May 25-26. Introduction Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. (hereafter “Namyang”) is the second-largest dairy manufacturer in South Korea (Dairy Market News Letter 2020). Namyang was established in 1964 as a baby formula manufacturer, and the company has grown to control about 16% of the milk market share (Seoul Dairy Cooperative n.d.). It has extensive product lines including milk, baby formulas, beverages, coffee, and various dairy products (Namyang Company n.d.). In the 1970s, the company sponsored the excellent children competition, and its successful marketing effort allowed the company to hold a strong brand position in the baby formula industry. Namyang’s milk sales started to take off after the company’s sensational product launch of “Einstein” milk which contains DHA in the 1990s (Namyang Company n.d.). However, consumers have boycotted the company since the Namyang scandal in 2013. Restoring brand reputation has been challenging, and the company has collaborated with other companies to disassociate itself from the negative brand image. A Well-Established Korean Distribution Tactic: MireonaegiMany dairy manufacturers in Korea manage a hybrid distribution system. Since a dairy distribution system needs to handle products from receiving to dispatch with high speed and precision, the manufacturers directly handle their distribution to major retailers for larger supplies and military units. Local franchisees that are allowed exclusive dealing of manufacturers’ products are often in charge of supplying milk to schools and local businesses and delivering dairy products to individual households.  Like any principal and agent relationship, Namyang has faced various conflicts with their franchisees. Mireonaegi, a well-established business strategy in South Korea, was not an unexpected or unprecedented move from Namyang to its franchisees. In fact, the Korean Fair Trade Commission charged a penalty to the company for its unfair trade practices in 2007 (Korea Fair Trade Commission n.d.b).  The direct translation of mireonaegi would be ‘unreasonable coercion to purchase.’ In an exclusive franchising relationship, manufacturers aggressively penetrate their new product in the market or force their franchisees to shoulder difficult to handle inventories by using mireonaegiThen franchisees need to pay for delivered products and to try to sell excessive products quickly by utilizing various promotions, such as 1+1 bundling sales, or donate products in order to minimize their losses. Franchisors’ superior bargaining position, which is innate in asymmetry power dynamics, have allowed the franchisor to continually take advantage of its franchisees.  The 2013 Namyang Scandal On January 26, 2013, three former and current Namyang franchisees filed a case at the Korea Fair Trade Commission for the company’s violation of the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act of Korea. The case was based on unreasonable coercion to purchaseand pressure to give rice cake cash gifts for the holidays to Namyang’s headquarters salespeople. Franchisees accused that Namyang had manipulated the ordering system and repeatedly delivered 200% more products than ordered quantity in order to meet the company’s sales goals. Due to the short shelf life, the franchisees had to discard the unsold products and be responsible for a significant loss. Throughout this process, the company had threatened franchisees that it would reject a renewal of their franchising contracts if franchisees did not accept the excessive amount of delivery (Park 2013a). A former franchisee also accused that the company compelled him to solely pay 70% of expenses for a promotion salesperson, who was working at a large retail chain, while the retailer covered 30% of the salary (Kang 2013). The franchisee claimed that the company forcibly pressured him to compensate a promotion salesperson.  A couple days later, about thirty franchisees rallied against the alleged unfair practices of Namyang in front of the company’s headquarters. Namyang sued the three former and current franchisees who filed a case at the Korea Fair Trade Commission for defamation. The company claimed that those three franchisees during the rally distributed false information including excessive mireonaegi, pressure for rice cake cash gifts during the holidays and illegal rebates. However, this did not receive much attention from either the media or the public. On May 3, 2013, an abusive conversation between a Namyang salesperson and a franchisee went viral on a social media platform. The salesperson, who is in his 30s, used abusive language to the 53 year-old franchisee while the salesperson talked about franchisees’ responsibilities for mireonaegi. Soon, an additional voice recording which asked for rice cake cash gifts for the holidays was released (Yonhap News Agency 2013). The association of convenience store franchisees started a boycott for the entire Namyang products as a group. Within two weeks, Namyang’s dairy product sales decreased 15% compared to the same time in the previous year. Namyang’s market competitors enjoyed an increase in sales due to a substitutional effect as the boycott continued, and it lowered their market share gaps (Kim, B-J 2013).  The public recognized this as a strong case of Gabjil, which is referred to as “an arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in South Korea who have positions of power over others (Korean Open Dictionary n.d.).” Individuals started to pay more attention to unfair trade practices in franchisor-franchisee relationships that are based on asymmetry power dynamics in nature. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Korea confiscated and searched Namyang. The prosecutors secured documents related to product distribution, accounting books, reports, and computer hard disks (Jung, 2013). Namyang publicly apologized for its wrongdoings. However, individuals did not believe its public apology was sincere. The chairman, the figurehead of the Korean Chaebeol Conglomerate, did not join the event. Namyang then discussed to resolve the issue with its franchisee association after its stock prices declined and consumers started to boycott its products. During that process, Namyang’s involvement in the process of establishing a franchisee association was revealed, and franchise victims created a separate association as a result (Park 2013b). The company sued the former franchisee who released a transcript of Namyang’s unreasonable mireonaegi for a violation of the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection (Herald Pop 2013). The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Korea found a legal advisory opinion that was written in 2011 from the confiscated documents. The document stated that “it may be illegal if the company forcibly required franchisees to purchase more than what they actually ordered.” The document was also signed by the CEO. Thus, Namyang’s denials of the mireonaegi business practices to the public broke consumers’ remaining trust (Jung, 2013), even though Namyang publicly apologized for its wrongdoings. On July 8, 2013, the Korea Fair Trade Commission found evidence that supported the franchisees’ allegations regarding Namyang’s unreasonable coercion to purchase and coercion to provide benefits (Thomson Reuters Practical Law 2013). The commission imposed a penalty of 12.3 billion KRW (10.9 million USD). The company agreed to compensate losses from unfair business practices to its franchisees and to financially support franchisees who suffered damage due to the boycott. The Namyang franchise victims’ alliance agreed to drop the lawsuits against Namyang and its employee (Kim, T-J 2013). Many individuals naively believed that the underdogs finally won, and that Namyang and its franchisees had found a happy medium. On January 30, 2015, Namyang filed a lawsuit for canceling the 12.3 billion KRW (10.9 million USD) penalty against the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The Seoul Central District Court judge denied the illegality of Namyang’s unreasonable coercion to purchase and canceled all portions exceeding 500 million KRW (441 thousand USD). Later, the former franchisee filed a case to the Korean Fair Trade Commission again. In early 2020, the Korean Fair Trade Commission publicly notified that the commission had worked with Namyang to correct its unfair trade practices. The company agreed to improve its relationships and business practices with franchisees. The proposed resolution guarantees franchisees’ rights to establish an association, and any major changes of items in the franchise contract would be consulted with the franchisee association (FTC News 2020).  The Korea Fair Trade Commission’s Competition Policy According to the Korea Fair Trade Commission, unfair trade practices are defined as “trading conducted unfairly or unjustly, which may limit free competition in the market (Korea Fair Trade Commission n.d. a).”  The Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act in Article 23 stated that “No business entity shall do any of the following acts that are likely to hinder fair trade, or require its affiliates or other business entities to do such act: (1) Unfairly refusing a transaction or discriminating against a certain transaction partner, (2) Unfairly excluding competitor, (3) unfairly soliciting or coercing customers of competitors to make transactions with it, (4) Making a transaction with a certain transaction partner unfairly taking advantage of its bargaining position, (5) Making a transaction under terms and conditions that unfairly restrict business activities of a transaction partner or disruption business activities of other business entities, (6) Assisting a related party or other company by doing any of the following acts: (a) Providing advanced payments, loans, human resources, real estate, securities, goods, services, intangible property rights, etc. for the related party or other company or making a transaction with the related party or other company under substantially advantageous terms; (b) Making a transaction through the related party or other company, acting as an intermediary, that does not play a practical role in the transaction, despite making such transaction with other business entity is substantially advantageous, (7) Any act that is likely to hinder fair trade, other than those listed in subparagraphs 1 through 6. (Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act n.d.).”  Even though Namyang’s unfair trade practices were found in 2013 by the Korea Fair Trade Commission, the Seoul Central District Court judge denied the allegation toward unreasonable mireonaegi. The company avoided legal consequences of its unreasonable mireonaegi. Its franchisees claimed that they have not been fully compensated from the financial damage that were created by the unreasonable coercion to purchase and coercion to provide benefits. Also, current franchisees who are members of the Namyang franchise victims’ alliance have been excluded from ongoing training and promotional items by Namyang (Lee, Lee, and Chang 2015). Owner Risk: Wrong Visions and Wrongdoings  Like many Chaebol companies in Korea, the founder of Namyang gave ownership of the company to his first son, Chairman Hong, Won Seek. In 2003, he was restricted and released for an accusation of receiving a large amount of illegal rebates from construction companies to create a slush fund. He then rescued himself from the management role by hiring a new CEO, Kim, Yoong, to shift public attention. However, the company had always found quick solutions in order to disengage with social controversies including unfair dealings with its franchisees, fixing and illegal rebates, noise and obscene marketing practices, and trademark infringement allegations. The public does not trust the company’s numerous public apologies. This is especially true after an employee’s claim during a training event that went viral on Twitter that stated, “[h]aving the largest share of the market is not possible without breaking the law.” (Seoul Shinmum 2013; KoreaBang n.d.).  Reputation Management: Ongoing Scandals and Boycotts  Since the 2013 Namyang Scandal, unreasonable mireonaegi in franchisor-franchisee relationships has received more public attention. Focusing on rapid growth in Korea’s economy now has shifted to healthy and balanced growth for all entities. Consumers tend to practice social justice by boycotting brands and products when unfair business practices go viral. Namyang has never recovered its sales in the dairy industry, and the company has tried its best to disassociate with its brands. Instead of promoting dairy products that are associated with its brand name, the company has promoted its sales by expanding the Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) business, Namyang F&B, which was established in 2011 to expand its beverage product lines. Since consumers are less likely to recognize a brand of an original equipment manufacturer, Namyang was able to generate profits by disassociating itself from infamous brands. In 2019, Namyang F&B even changed its brand name into “Healthy People Inc.” However, consumers have demanded Namyang’s business partners (e.g., convenient store chains and retailers), who hired Namyang as an original equipment manufacturer to produce retailers’ private branded products, to switch their partners (Kim 2020).                                                                Foxxcon is the original equipment manufacturer of iPhone, but end consumers are less likely to recognize brand names of OEMs.Moreover, the company started Baekmidang 1964, a milk & ice cream café, in 2014 and rapidly expand its business through franchising. However, many consumers have shared information about the relationship between Namyang and Baekmidang 1964 to encourage boycotting Namyang’s unrevealed businesses. Baekmidang 1964 entered into Hong Kong and China by signing a master franchise agreement with the New World Group (Lee 2019).  Figure 1 Namyang Dairy Products Co. Stock Prices (Source: Google Finance) Conclusion Several mireonaegi cases, such as Baesangmyun Brewery, CU convenience store, Hyundai Mobis, have received attention (Lee, Lee, and Chang 2015). Even though courts have ruled favorably toward franchisors that have strong legal counsels and financial resources, franchisors have to pay huge social punishments by consumers. Namyang’s scandal demonstrates that consumers do not always move on from companies’ wrongdoings.

While the impact of CSR on financial performance is weak, researchersseem to agree that CSR positively impacts the brand, reputation, and the goodwill of acompany undertaking CSR initiatives. Despite the substantial contributions of this streamof literature, there are three important gaps that this paper seeks to address in relation tofranchising networks: First, there are very few studies that focus on implementation of CSR in thefranchise settings. Franchising is a form of contractual relationship of legally independentbut  socially  and  economically  interdependent  franchisors  and  franchisees  (Michael,2013).  Franchisor  as  a  creator  of  the  concept  leads  CSR  initiatives  and  requirescommitment of franchisees to implement them. CSR programs are not part of a typicalfranchise contract and thus implementation of CSR in franchising networks is left to thediscretion of the franchisees. Similar issues were investigated in the context of supplychains, where the focal company has limited opportunity to introduce and control theimplementation  of  CSR  initiatives  down  the  value  chain.  Despite  calls  for  moreinvestigation of CSR in franchising (Combs, Ketchen, Shook, and Short, 2011; Michael,2013), the number of studies investigating CSR practices in franchising is very limited(e.g., Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot, Oxibar, & Déjean, 2015).  Second, while the relationship between CSR and various brand constructs hasbeen investigated in several studies, no research investigated the impact of CSR on brandcompetitiveness.  Brand  competitiveness  is  meaningful  when  comparing  competingbrands in a marketplace and is an important indicator of brand performance. This study isthe  first  to  present  empirical  evidence  of  relationship  between  CSR  and  brandcompetitiveness. Third,  prior  work  has  largely  focused  on either  franchisor’s  or  franchisees’perspective  of  brand.  In  reality  the  franchise  brands  are  co-created  by  multiplestakeholders:  franchisors,  franchisees,  employees  and  consumers,  who  play  role  asrecipients  and  co-creators  of  brand  benefits  (Ghantous  and  Christodoulides,  2020).Following the call for more research to enrich the current framework to include views ofother  stakeholder  groups,  we  adopt  the  co-creation  concept  of  brand  and  usecrowdsourcing to collect consumer brand assessments, additionally to brand assessmentsby the franchisors collected through a survey methodology. In  summary,  this  paper  pursues  the  objective  of  studying  the  CSR  brandcompetitiveness  relationship  in  the  franchise  settings  and  in  doing  so  adopts  aninnovative  methodology,  which  uses  alternative  measures  of  CSR,  as  well  ascrowdsourcing of brand data from consumers in addition to using a more traditionalsurvey approach for data collection.  We  use  empirical  data  from  Austrian  franchising  networks,  as  well  ascrowdsourced consumer data, to perform an innovative analysis to test our hypotheses onrelationship between CSR and brand competitiveness. First, we run the cluster analysisusing Carroll’s (1979) pyramid of corporate responsibilities and classify the franchisingfirms  in  two  groups:  franchise  companies  that  prioritize  economic  objectives  andfranchise companies that pursue a more balanced approach to economic, legal, ethicaland discretionary responsibilities. We find that the firms with a more balanced approachtowards CSR have higher brand competitiveness as compared to firms that focus more oneconomic objectives. Second, we run regression analysis and find that CSR measured ontwo dimensions “proactive CSR” and “partner preference” varies positively with brandcompetitiveness. Our study contributes to both CSR and franchising literature by beingthe first to document the role of CSR for brand competitiveness. The article is organized in five sections. Section 2 presents theory and formulatestestable hypotheses. We discuss the methodology in Section 3 and present the analysisand findings of the empirical study in Section 4. In Section 5 we conclude the article bypresenting some directions for the future research. THEORY AND HYPOTHESESCorporate Social ResponsibilityThere is no single definition of CSR (Vilanova, Lozano, & Arenas, 2009), however, thescope of CSR starts from the boundaries of minimum legal requirement and is mainlyrelated to firm’s discretionary actions in order to contribute towards the common socialgoals (Lindgreen, Xu, Maon, & Wilcock, 2012). Adoption of CSR initiatives starts fromreaction and defence, goes towards accommodation and proaction (Wilson, 1975; Carroll,1979). While reactive CSR aims mainly at regulatory compliance, proactive CSR aims atgoing beyond regulatory requirements and taking active role in solving societal problems(Chang, 2015). We adopt the definition by Torugsa, O’Donohue and Hecker (2013) thatproactive  CSR  represents  voluntary  activities  to  simultaneously  support  sustainableeconomic, social, and environmental development above the required compliance level.  The existing CSR literature can be divided into two main streams. The first streaminvestigates  the factors explaining  the motivations  and organizational  characteristicsinfluencing implementation of CSR programs. The second stream largely focuses oninvestigating the performance outcomes and consequences of implementation of CSRprograms (Du, Bhattacharya, & Sen, 2010). The firms may benefit from CSR in severalways: CSR implementation may support brand building efforts of the firms by creating amore positive view  of the products and business activities  and may encourage thecustomers and other stakeholders to place higher trust in the firm by seeking employment(Greening and Turban, 2000) or investing in the firm (Sen, Bhattacharya, & Korschun,2006). A firm can focus on its CSR activities by creating a balance between social andeconomic goals, and by its commitment to engage in activities beyond minimum legalrequirement  (Sen,  Bhattacharya,  &  Korschun,  2006).  A  firm  with  superior  CSRperformance has better access to financing due to reduced agency costs and reducesinformation asymmetry (Cheng, et al., 2014). Ultimately, engaging in CSR is in the self-interest of the firm for longer term viability (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). There are certainstudies that evidence positive relationship between CSR and improved reputation of thebusiness (Fombrun, Gardberg, & Barnett, 2000; Melo & Garrido-Morgado, 2012). TheCSR implementation may also have positive relationship with commitment of employees(Brammer, Millington, & Rayton, 2007; T. B. Porter, 2008) and lower level of employeeturnover (DeTienne, Agle, Phillips, & Ingerson, 2012). However, the findings of the pastCSR research are quite heterogeneous. Several studies present mixed findings regardingthe relationship between implementation of CSR and economic performance (Balabanis,Phillips,  &  Lyall,  1998;  Flammer,  2015;  Kiessling,  Isaksson,  &  Yasar,  2015).Contradictory findings range from positive to negative relation (Margolis and Walsch,2003 and Margolis et al., 2007), U-shaped (Barnett and Salomon, 2012) and inverse U-shaped relation. The mixed nature of the findings can be explained by the fact that thesestudies have been conducted in different settings, use different aspects of CSR andperformance measurement (e.g. Chatterji et al (2016) show that the  six most popularsocial ratings correlate poorly), as well as due to important theoretical and empiricallimitations (McWilliams and Siegel, 2000) like stakeholder mismatching, measurementerrors, and omitted variable bias.  In summary, the past literature suggests that CSR implementation may or may nothave direct relationship with economic performance of the firm, but more probably mayhave an indirect effect though influencing consumer perceptions, brand equity, andcorporate  reputation.  The  amount  of  literature  on  relationship  between  CSR  andcompetitiveness is rather limited and these studies approach competitiveness from afinancial perspective and focus on documenting empirically  the  relationship betweenfinancial performance and CSR (Vilanova, Lozano, & Arenas, 2009).2.2.  Brand competitiveness Brand competitiveness is defined as a brand’s possession of competitive advantage, theability to outperform competitors by providing better value through a combination ofprice and product/service quality (Winzar at al, 2018). The construct is meaningful whencomparing  competing  brands  in  a  marketplace.  Recent  research  has  focused  oninvestigating the drivers of brand competitiveness (Gupta et al, 2020). Implementation of CSR initiatives may result in higher competitiveness becauseof increased the brand awareness and strength. Previous research focused on relationshipsbetween CSR and brand credibility, brand equity, corporate reputation (Hur, Kim &Woo, 2014); brand attachment, brand attitude, purchase intention (Kull and Heath, 2016),brand financial performance (Lai et al, 2010), service brand loyalty (He and Li, 2011),brand trust, brand affect and brand loyalty (Singh et al, 2012). These studies wereconducted  in different empirical settings:  in the service industries  (He & Li, 2011),consumer goods (Singh, Iglesias & Batista-Fogu, 2012; Hur, Kim and Woo, 2014) andbusiness-to-business markets (Lai et al, 2010). Some brands provide an opportunity totheir consumers to choose a charitable action to which the brand will donate in responseto the consumer’s purchase, providing an evidence of the CSR and brand relationship(Kull and Heath, 2015). The brand name is one of most important intangible assets a firm can base itscompetitive advantage on (Aaker, 1989; Hall, 1993). In franchising, brand name is animportant intangible asset that has a  direct  effect on franchise network’s performance(Gorovaia and Windsperger, 2013; Nyadzayo, Matanda & Ewing, 2015). No research onthe relationship between CSR and brand competitiveness has been done in the franchisingcontext and this paper addresses this gap.2.3. Combining brand co-creation with crowdsourcingIn marketing literature the idea of a company-centred and company-controlled brand hasbeen gradually replaced by the concept of a multi-stakeholder co-creation of brands(Ramaswamy & Ozcan, 2016; Zhang, Jiang, Shabbir & Du, 2015). Brand co-creationassumes active role of individuals and “explicit recognition of individual human beingsas “experiencers” of the brand” (Ramaswamy and Ozcan, 2016). Digitally empoweredconsumers  disrupted  the conventional model of brand management from a one-wayprocess  to  a  more  complex,  multi-stakeholder  joint  creation  process.  Recentdevelopments in high tech platforms and social media facilitated communication with thecrowds. Crowdsourcing became a powerful strategic tool for brands to extend and expandbrand value because of firm’s ability to communicate with brand communities (Bal et al,2017). Crowdsourcing is based on Surowiecki’s idea of “wisdom of crowds” (2004):decisions taken by a large group, even if the individuals within the group aren't smart, arealways better than decisions made by small numbers of  “experts”.  Surowiecki relates ananecdote that during a county’s fair visitors were asked to guess the weight of an ox, andwhile none of them was able to guess the weight correctly, the mathematical average ofall the answers, revealed the number without an error. Crowdsourcing engages consumers by asking them to become part of brand co-creation  and  provides  dynamic  marketing  opportunities  for  brands.  According  toGhantous and Christodoulides (2020) empirical research studying brand perceptions andsimultaneously using data from multiple stakeholders remains scarce. We address the gapby using the data on franchise brands from two stakeholder sources: the franchisors andthe consumers.      2.4 Hypotheses Proactive CSR is defined as business strategies and practices that are adopted voluntarilybeyond regulatory requirements in order to support economic, social and environmentalprinciples of sustainable development (Torugsa et al, 2012). We argue that franchisingfirms being network organizations differ in the their implementation of CSR initiatives:Firstly, the franchisor’s proactive CSR strategy is going to impact the scale and scope ofCSR  initiatives  within  the  network.  Secondly,  support  of  CSR  activities  by  thefranchisees is crucial for the success of implementation.   CSR initiatives may result in positive perception of the brand in the minds ofstakeholders (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2004; Torres, Bijmolt, Tribó, & Verhoef, 2012) andmay  increase  their  loyalty  and  recommendation.  Innovative  ideas  on  recycling,sustainable efforts, fair sourcing are more likely to draw the attention of customers and,therefore, improve brand awareness and brand perception among them. Therefore, it isvery important for a franchise system to incorporate CSR values into its corporatestrategy.  While  these  practices  may  have  different  level  of  engagement  includingrecognizing the responsibility of the firm beyond generating profits and meeting theminimum legal requirement, we argue that the franchisor’s proactive CSR strategy willresult in increased brand competitiveness of a franchise system. H1:  Franchisor’s  proactive  corporate  social  responsibility  has  a  positiverelationship with brand competitiveness.The franchisor as a recruiter of new franchisees can facilitate CSR initiatives by selectingfranchise partners with proven commitment to CSR. Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012)observed that franchise companies, being network organisations, are different  in theirimplementation of CSR programs. CSR is not a part of a typical franchise contract andfranchisees have no legal obligation to implement CSR programs. Previous research has highlighted the difficulties of adopting CSR initiatives insupply chains, where a socially responsible company attempts to persuade supply chainpartners to implement CSR or select partners based on their fulfilment of CSR requisites(Cruz, 2009; Ciliberti, De Haan, De Groot, & Pontrandolfo, 2011). The problem ofimplementing CSR initiatives  in franchising companies is in many  ways similar: afranchisor cannot pressure franchisees to implement a CSR program, but can encourageand convince them to do so. Cooperation of franchisees is crucial for the success ofadoption and implementation of CSR initiatives  (Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012). Toensure a smooth implementation of a network-wide CSR strategy, franchise partners mustshare  commitment  to  social  and environmental  causes. It  is more  efficient  for thefranchisors to implement CSR programs in a centralized way if the franchise partnersbelieve in the value of CSR and are committed. In addition, franchisors with better CSRperformance  may  also  be  more  attractive  for  franchisees  due  to  improved  image(Perrigot, et al., 2015) and attract franchisees will higher capabilities and resources toimprove the brand competitiveness of the system. Therefore, we argue that in selection ofthe franchise partners, their commitment to CSR plays an important role. By focusing onpartnerships between franchisors and franchisees in implementing CSR initiatives, ourpaper  contributes  to  the  literature  on  collaborations  in  fostering  CSR  in  inter-organizational settings (Svendsen & Laberge, 2005; Murillo & Lozano, 2009; Phillips,2010).   Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:H2: Franchise partners with proven commitment to CSR will positively impact brand competitiveness.  METHODOLOGY3.1. Data collectionThe data for this research was collected from two sources: a survey of the Austrianfranchisors and a survey of the crowd about their perceptions of the Austrian franchisebrands. We first obtained the list of all the franchise systems in Austria from the AustrianFranchise Association (AFA). The AFA identifies 311 franchise systems in Austria in2014. After several preliminary steps in questionnaire development, including interviewswith the representatives of AFA and few franchise professionals, the questionnaire waspre-tested with 10 franchisors in Vienna. The final questionnaire was sent out to themanagers of the franchise organizations by post. The data were obtained through a keyinformant approach  (McKendall & Wagner III, 1997). Key informants for this  surveywere senior managers of the franchise organizations who are mainly responsible formanagement of franchise networks and expansion. The information about key informantswas retrieved from the list of franchise companies obtained from AFA. Additionally, anonline  version  of the  questionnaire  was  made  available  to  the  respondents  on thehttps://www.soscisurvey.de and a link for online survey was sent via e-mail to all 311franchise systems. Three weeks later, we sent reminders via e-mail to the companies thathad not responded. In the process of data collection, we found out that 31 franchisecompanies did not have franchised outlets or did not use franchising anymore. Thisreduced  our  target  population  to  280  systems.  Altogether,  we  received  65  usableresponses reflecting a response rate of 23%, which is consistent with comparable studiesusing  key  informant  methodology.  We  compared  the  early  respondents  to  the  laterespondents to test for non-response bias, where late respondents served as proxy for non-respondents  (Armstrong & Overton, 1977). We did not find any differences between thetwo groups of respondents. The second survey was addressed to the crowd and was distributed through socialmedia in various Austrian online communities, including Austrian students’ community.Social media platforms are very appealing to crowdsourcing because they are widelyused, accessible, and cost-effective (Afuah and Tucci, 2012).  Participants of the surveywere from the general public anonymous to the researchers. The participants were shownthe graphic and textual representation of a brand and asked to evaluate it compared to itscompetitors. Participants could skip a brand, if they had insufficient experience with it.Each brand received a different number of assessments from min 87 to max 238 with anaverage of 142 assessments per brand. To construct the index we calculated averages ofcustomers’ assessments. Crowdsourcing is recommended as a method when the researchquestion  is  straightforward,  easily  defined,  and  can  be  reasonably  expected  to  beunderstood by the general public or when the question aims to measure public sentiment.It is the best method when value is placed on diversity of opinion (Flostrand, 2017). Mostof the studies on franchising used a company-centred and company-controlled concept ofbrand and collect brand-related data from one source, namely the franchisors. In thispaper the brand data is collected from two sources: from the franchisors and from theconsumers, which is consistent with the brand co-creation concept. 3.2.MeasurementThe survey administered to franchisors requested information on proactive economic,social and environmental attitudes of franchisors, beyond those legally required andcompliance-driven.  Furthermore,  we  requested  descriptive  data,  e.g.  the  year  ofestablishment and total number employees at headquarters. To test the hypotheses thefollowing variables were used: brand competitiveness (Brand), proactive CSR (PCSRpreferred partner (Partner), age of the franchise system () and size of the franchisesystem (Size3.2.1. Dependent VariableBrand competitiveness  (Brand) was adopted from previous empirical studies in thefranchise context (Combs & Ketchen, 2004; Barthélemy, 2008). Four items on a seven-point Likert-type scale  operationalize  the construct of brand name  competitiveness.Brand competitiveness was measured as an average index of all items, consisting offranchisors’ and customers’ brand assessments. Franchisors and customers were asked torate the systems on brand strength compared to competitors, brand recognition comparedto competitors, reputation for quality, and the importance of brand name for achievingcompetitive advantage. 3.2.2. Predictor Variables CSR  is  an  elusive  concept  to  define  and  to  operationalize.  Various  theories  likesustainable development theory, stakeholder management theory contributed to differentoperationalisations of CSR, as well  creation of related concepts such as sustainabledevelopment, corporate social performance, corporate citizenship, which resulted in CSRliterature being blurred and disconnected (Perez and Rodriguez del Bosque, 2013).  We measured CSR concept in two ways: first, we operationalised CSR constructbased on Carroll’s pyramid of responsibilities (1979), second, to capture the proactivedimension of CSR policies, and choice of partners committed to CSR, we used reflectivemeasurement scales. Following Carroll (1979), we asked the respondents of the survey tospecify  what  percentage  they  give  to  each  of  the  four  categories  (economicresponsibilities, legal responsibilities, ethical behaviour and philanthropy), with a total of100%. Following Torugsa, O’Donohue and Hecker (2013) we defined proactive CSR asvoluntary  activities  to  support  sustainable  economic,  social  and  environmentaldevelopment beyond compliance level.  We have two predictor variables in our model: proactive CSR (PCSR) and partnerpreference  (Partner). To operationalize  proactive  CSR (PCSR), a set of items  thatdescribe the variable is needed. The items have to be grounded in theory and relevant tothe franchise context. We base our variables on the measures used in the previous studies(Luo, 2006; Park & Ghauri, 2015). In the first step, we define PCSR based on review of academic literature (Keinert,2008). In the second step, we develop a comprehensive set of items that characterizeproactive  economic,  social  and  environmental  attitudes  of  franchisors,  above  thoselegally  required  and  compliance-driven.  We  discussed  all  the  items  with  franchisepractitioners and adapted the formulation of the questions to the franchise context. In the third step, we perform a principal component analysis of all the CSR andbrand items in order to reduce the number of explanatory variables and allow a groundedclassification  of  CSR  components,  rather  than  to  accept  one  of  the  contradictingdefinitions of CSR.  Three factors emerged with large eigenvalues (4.346, 1.747 and1.463) and together accounted for 69 percent of total variance. The factor loadings afterare listed in Table 1. All factors have high factor loadings above 0.626.The analysis of the factor loadings suggests that the first factor captures proactiveCSR commitment  to economic, social,  and environmental  causes  above the legallyrequired, the second factor highlights that commitment to social and environmentalcauses  makes  a  company  a  preferred  partner.  The  third  factor  represents  brandcompetitiveness.  3.2.3. Control VariablesOrganization size has been shown as a fundamental predictor of whether the organizationengages in CSR or not  (Wang, Gao, Hodgkinson, Rousseau, & Flood, 2015). Keinert(2008, p. 139) argues that small and medium enterprises do not engage in CSR due totheir struggle for growth and survival. We measure the size of the franchise system (Sizeas the number employees working in the headquarters of the franchise system. Largerfranchise systems are more likely to pursue CSR initiatives and result in higher brandcompetitiveness. Size of the franchising firm is also associated  with resources andcapabilities of the franchise network (Combs, Michael, & Castrogiovanni, 2004). We also control for the age of the franchise system ( is measured by thenumber of years since the opening of the first franchise outlet. Age is a proxy for inter-organizational learning and experience (Gulati & Sytch, 2008). Older franchise systemsare more likely to pursue CSR initiatives and hence increase the brand competitiveness. is  also  traditionally  seen  as  associated  with  firm’s  resources  and  capabilitiesparticularly is franchising (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1968; Combs, et al., 2004). <Insert Table 1 Here>3.4.Construct Validity We use multi-item scales for measuring PCSRPartner and Brand competitiveness. check convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs we estimated the averageintra-construct correlation as a ‘‘within measure’’ and the average correlation of eachconstruct’s items with each other construct’s items as a ‘‘between measure’’. The resultsare presented in the Table 2. The ‘‘within’’ average correlations are higher than the‘‘between’’ average correlations, providing support of discriminant validity of theseconstructs. Cronbach alpha shows values above the recommended cut-off value of 0.70(Cronbach, 1951): Brand =0.740, PCSR=0.837, Partner=0.870. The 11 items reflecting the three constructs of the proposed model were examinedvia confirmatory factor analysis with the initial analysis indicating only a poor fit: χ71.569 (df  = 41,  < 0.05), comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.90, Tucker-Lewis-index(TLI) of 0.868 and root mean square of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.111. Cross-loadings were examined via modification indices and standardized residuals. Two itemsof the Brand construct (“The quality of our franchise system is very good in comparisonto our competitors” and “Our brand is very strong compared to our competitors”) areconceptually close and thus it is conceptually plausible that the error terms might becorrelated.  We added this  path to the model.  Furthermore,  we added another pathbetween error terms of two items of  Partner  construct (“A franchisee with provencommitment to social and environmental issues is a preferred contractual partner”, “Afranchisor with proven commitment to social and environmental issues is a preferredcontractual  partner”)  which  is  also  conceptually  plausible.  The  CFA  analysis  wasrepeated and resulted in an acceptable fit of the measurement model: χ= 44.124 (39, p =0.264), CFI 0.984, TLI 0.977 and RMSEA 0.047. <Insert Table 2 Here>ANALYSISTable 3 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the sample. The average our  sample  is  16.38  years  and  the  average  Size is  around  61  employees  in  theheadquarters.<Insert Table 3 Here>We start with the cluster analysis using Carroll’s (1979) pyramid of responsibilities. Thenwe proceed with testing our hypotheses with the regression analysis. 4.1. Cluster AnalysisWe used deductive approach to select the number and suitability of clustering variablesas recommended by Ketchen and Shook (1996).  Following Carroll’s (1979) definition ofCSR, we asked the respondents of the survey to specify what percentage they give toeach  of the four categories  (economic  responsibilities,  legal  responsibilities,  ethicalbehaviour and philanthropy), with a total of 100%. We performed a cluster analysis withthe four clustering variables derived from Carroll (1979) using a two-stage procedureusing Euclidean distances. Two-stage procedure increases validity of solution because itcombines hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods: first, a hierarchical algorithm isused to define the number of clusters and centroids; second, the results from the firststage are used for subsequent non-hierarchical clustering (Ketchen and Shook, 1996).Examination  of  the  dendrogram  indicated  a  two-cluster  solution.  We  checked  therobustness of the finding by re-running the analysis with non-standardized variables, asresults may differ based on standardization, and achieved the same result. We also re-analysed the data using random halves of the total sample and the results were consistentacross sample halves.  Table 4 presents a final cluster solution. A closer analysis of the scores derivedfrom the cluster analysis allows the following observations to be made: the first cluster(44%) consists of franchise companies that have a balanced view and give relativelyequal priorities to their economic, legal, ethical and discretionary responsibilities. Thesecond cluster (56%) consists of franchise companies that give very high priority to theireconomic responsibilities, giving significantly less to legal, ethical and philanthropicresponsibilities. As presented in Table 4, the firms in the first cluster gave more equalimportance to economic, legal, ethical and discretional responsibilities. <Insert Table 4 Here>To assess criterion-related validity we performed T-tests with external variables that werenot  used  in  defining  clusters.  Given  our  emphasis  on  investigating  CSR-brandcompetitiveness  relationship,  the  external  variables  were  brand  competitivenesscomputed as an average of franchisors’ and customers’ brand assessments, as well ascontrol variables, such as age and size of the franchise system. We performed T-tests toinvestigate  the difference between two clusters on brand competitiveness. The firstcluster has a higher Brand score as compared to the second cluster (p<0.1). We found nodifference between the two clusters in terms of Size and Age. Results of T-test analysisare reported in Table 5. <Insert Table 5 Here>4.4. Regression AnalysisTo test  H1 and H2, we employ ordinary least squares regression (OLS) with  BrandCompetitiveness as dependent variable. The dependent variable is measured as an averageof franchisors’ and customers’ brand assessments. The predictor variables are PCSR andPartner. Additionally,  Size and  Age  are included in the regression analysis as controlvariables. We do not find any multi-collinearity indication. We estimate the followingregression equation: Brand = α0 + αAge+ αSizePCSR + αPartner + εWe expect that proactive CSR will positively impact the Brand competitiveness.Furthermore, we also expect that partners with proven commitment to CSR initiativeswill  positively  impact  the  Brand  competitiveness.  Table  6  presents  the  results  ofregression analysis. Model 1 includes only control variables while Model 2 includes bothcontrol and predictor variables. The coefficients of PCSR and Partner with proven commitment to CSR initiativesare  positive  and  highly  significant.  Hence  both  hypotheses  are  supported  by  theregression analysis. Additionally, the coefficient of the Size is positive and significant,indicating  that  larger  franchise  systems  are  more  likely  to  have  stronger  BrandCompetitiveness.   4.5.Cross-validation of Regression ResultsOur sample size of 65 responses exceeds the minimum threshold of 10 observations perpredictor variable  (Harris, 2013) and of total 57 observations for regression analysis(VanVoorhis & Morgan, 2007). To mitigate potential concerns about the validity of ourresults given the small sample size we employed bootstrapping to cross-validate ourmodel. (Woodside, 2013, Harrell, Lee & Mark, 1996, Steyerberg, Eijkemans, Harrell, &Habbema, 2000). This technique is based on extensive resampling from the existingsample and is widely used for cross validation  (Cramer, Bunce, Patterson, & Frank,1988).  We  subjected  our  regression  model  to  2000  repetitions  and  the  confidenceintervals are reported in Table 7. <Insert Table 7 Here>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 5.1. FindingsWe tested the relationship between CSR and brand competitiveness in franchise settings.CSR is measured along the dimensions of proactive CSR and partner preference. We alsoused Carroll’s  (1979) responsibility pyramid to create an alternative measurement ofCSR. The results based on analysis of the empirical data collected from the Austrianfranchise  systems  suggest  a  positive  relationship  between  CSR  and  brandcompetitiveness. Exploratory cluster analysis revealed two clusters of franchise firms:  one groupof the firms has clearly more focus on economic goals, while another group has a morebalancedapproach and focus on all four dimensions of corporate social responsibility(Carroll, 1979). The brand competitiveness of the second cluster is significantly highercompared to the first cluster. We show that a balanced approach toward CSR results inhigher competitiveness of the firm.  Regression analysis revealed that proactive CSR strategy of the franchisor has apositive  impact on brand competitiveness. Proactive CSR strategy results in initiatingCSR programs in the franchise system, which ultimately create more favourable view ofthe brand among consumers. Hence, it strengthens franchisor’s brand in comparison withcompetitors. Regression analysis also showed that franchise partners with commitment to CSRhave positive impact on brand competitiveness. The success or the failure of CSRprograms largely depends on the franchisees and their acceptance of the program. Thefranchisors should consider it at the very beginning of a franchise relationship and selectfranchisees that share commitment to CSR.  On the other hand, it may also be argued thatfranchisors perceive that CSR initiatives will have positive impact on their attractivenessas preferred partners, and that they can leverage benefits on their CSR reputation byattracting better franchisees. 5.2. ContributionsOur findings contribute towards the franchise literature  by shedding more light on theexisting CSR-performance relationship. First, we extend the existing stream of literatureon performance outcomes of CSR in general and corporate competitiveness in particular(M. E. Porter & Kramer, 2006) by presenting empirical evidence from a business sector,where brand is relatively more important and brand management is unique (Pitt, et al.,2003). The past research also calls for further investigation into different dimensions ofperformance  implications  of  CSR  in  order  to  enhance  the  understanding  of  thephenomenon  (Brammer & Millington, 2008). Second, we address the call for furtherresearch into business ethics in franchising in order to enhance the ethical dimension ofthe franchising research (Combs, et al., 2011) and improve our understanding how theconcept of corporate social responsibility applies to a franchise chain (Michael, 2013).We argue that CSR has a positive impact on brand competitiveness. Our contributions are also methodological: we use an innovative measure for CSRbased on Caroll’s pyramid of responsibilities  (Carroll, 1979, 1999). Carroll’s studiesinspired lots of research in CSR, however, no previous study created a measurementmodel utilizing this concept. Our measure enabled us to collect and analyse data based onthe actual decision-making problems firms face while adopting CSR. The franchisorswere  asked  to  allocate  a  percentage  importance  (out  of  100)  to  each  of  the  fourdimensions of CSR. Furthermore,  we used  crowdsourcing and more traditional survey methodologyfor data collection. Compared to previous studies that used either only franchisors’ oronly  franchisees’  brand  assessments,  we follow  the  brand  co-creation  concept  thatconsiders customers brand co-creators by being active experiencers of the brand.  Wecollected the brand competitiveness data from two stakeholder groups: franchisors andcustomers. 5.3. Practical implications The findings have practical implications for the franchisors and franchise-managers. Thefranchisors should balance economic, legal, ethical and discretionary responsibilities andbe proactive in implementation of CSR  programs to achieve  brand competitiveness.Franchisors should also incorporate criteria related to CSR reputation and commitment infranchisee  selection.  Franchisees’  participation  in  CSR  programs  is  critical  forimplementation, makes them preferred partners, and contributes to brand competitivenessat the outlet level.  Effective implementation of CSR will result in increased brandcompetitiveness for the benefit of both franchisors and franchisees. 5.4. LimitationsThis study has certain limitations. First, the sample size is rather small and there might besome concerns about the generalizability of the findings. It would be interesting to testthe similar relationships on larger samples in different cultural contexts and by takinginto account the franchisees’ perspective.  Second, we use subjective measures of brandcompetitiveness based on the perceptions of the franchisors and the customers. While weargue that crowd’s assessment of brand competitiveness are accurate, we have no datafrom other stakeholders like franchisees, employees. Future studies should investigate thebrand co-creation collecting data from other sources and testing the misalignment ofbrand assessments of different stakeholder groups. Third, our study does not differentiatebetween single-unit franchising vs. multi-unit franchising. Multi-unit franchisees arelarger  partners  with  higher  organizational  capabilities  and  resources  (Hussain  &Windsperger, 2010) and they are in a better position to implement CSR programs moreeffectively as compared with single-unit franchisees (Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012). Thefuture research may also explore the differences among different forms of franchising interms of CSR implementation and organizational performance. \n",
      "Antecedents of international franchising strategy Tamara Massold Maria Jell-Ojobor Josef Windsperger Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 24-26, 2021Antecedents of international franchising strategy Abstract Purpose – Identification of antecedents for international franchisor’s standardization/adaptation strategy. Definition of practical implications for the international management regarding the adaptation and standardization degree of international franchise strategy.  Design/methodology – This study uses survey data collected from franchise headquarters in eight countries. It applies quantitative research methods, i.e., multiple regression analysis. Findings - Power distance, cultural uncertainty, franchisor’s system specific assets and franchisee's local assets significantly influence adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies.Research limitations/implications – Limited sample size of 162 international franchisors from US and Western European countries. It is not a longitudinal study.  Originality/value – First study in international franchising that investigates antecedents of international franchisor’s standardization/adaptation strategy.  Keywords International franchising, antecedents of international franchisor’s strategy, standardization and adaptation degree of strategy  1. Introduction Franchising is a known strategy for business growth, job creation, and economic development, and has been a common way for companies to enter foreign markets or expand internationally (Dant and Gruenhagen, 2014). Similar as in common international companies co-alignment of strategy and structure is important for operations and performance of international franchising networks. Apparently, various factors like culture, brand reputation, trust, and knowledge sharing are highly critical for gaining fit between strategy and structure in franchising networks (Alon et al., 2012). For achieving fit between strategy, structure and performance international franchising companies needs to take a closer look on their international strategy. Especially important in franchising networks is the decision whether to use standardization or adaptation strategy when entering an unknown or foreign market. So far, franchising research hardly explored the influencing factors for the standardization versus adaptation of strategies, and their fit with firm structure in foreign countries. Standardization is a fundamental characteristic of franchising as a business format (Kaufmann and Eroglu, 1999). Business format franchising is characterized through a constant tension between the franchisor, who strives for standardization in order to achieve uniform corporate activities and economies of scale, and franchisees, who need local adaptation of certain business format features for market satisfaction (Fock, 2001). Differences between markets exist in terms of production conditions, labor costs, nature of firm activities and other regional conditions, which need to be accommodated in the local franchise operations through strategy adaptation (North and Smallbone, 1995; Smallbone et al., 1993; Vaessen and Keeble, 1995). The franchisor wants to preserve consistency of a high quality standard of products/services and its goodwill and brand equity among the franchise system, whereas the franchisees asks for independence (Dant and Gundlach, 1999). Usually franchisors regulate core components of the system and franchisees are responsible for peripheral components (Kaufmann and Eroglu, 1999), such as product-mix, pricing, marketing and human relations, which they adapt to fit the local market requirements (Cox and Mason, 2007). However, adaptations of a format can damage the franchise’s competitive advantages, brand name and consistency (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001, Choo, 2001). While standardization of a strategy positively impact economies of scale and consumers’ brand identification it can have a negative impact on local sales, when the franchise product or service is not conform with the host market environment conditions (Alon, 2004).Thus, the aim of this paper is to identify the antecedents of international franchisor’s degree of standardization/adaptation strategy, or in other words: which variables/factors influence the choice of franchisor’s international strategy. The goal is to define those parameters, which help international franchising companies to choose standardization or adaptation strategy in preparation of successfully entering a new host country or market.  2. Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses development Our research model about the antecedents of the international strategy of franchise firms is based on hypotheses derived from cultural theory, transaction cost theory and resource-based theory. It is summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1. Research ModelCultural theory hypothesisAccording to the cultural theory, the national culture of firm headquarters influences the strategies adopted by the international franchise companies (Erramilli, 1996; Hennart and Larimo, 1998). Geert Hofstede developed a frequently used framework for measuring of cultural differences between countries (Morosini et al., 1998) and conducted several studies during last decades to verify the framework (Hofstede, 1984, 1991, 2001). The distinct feature of his framework are the five cultural dimensions which he linked with demographic, geographic, economic, and political aspects of a society and to which he assigned indexes for all nations (Kale and Barnes, 1992). Table 1 describes the five cultural dimensions. Cultural dimension Description Power distance  This dimension reflects the consequences of power inequality and authority relations in society. It influences hierarchy and dependence relationships in the family and organizational contexts. Individualism vs. collectivism This dimension describes the relationships individuals have in each culture. In individualistic societies, individuals look after themselves and their immediate family only whereas in collectivistic cultures, individuals belong to groups that look after them in exchange for loyalty. Uncertainty avoidance  “The extent to which people feel threatened by uncertainty and ambiguity and try to avoid these situations” (Hofstede, 1991, p. 113). This dimension deals with the need for well-defined rules for prescribed behavior. Femininity vs. masculinity Dominant values in masculine countries are achievement and success and in feminine countries are caring for others and quality of life. Short-term vs. long term orientation Long-term orientation “stands for the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards, in particular perseverance and thrift” (Hofstede, 2001, p. 359).  Table 1. Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Soares et. al., 2007) Previous research showed that two of Hofstede's dimensions – power distance (PD) and uncertainty avoidance (UA) – influence organizational decision-making in a cross-border context. PD describes how people belonging to a specific culture view power relationships and accept social inequalities (Hofstede, 2001). Managers of franchising companies from countries which score high on power distance are more autocratic and prefer to keep power over strategic decision-making (Erramilli, 1996). UA measures the extent to which people feel uncomfortable in the presence of vagueness and ambiguity (Hofstede, 2001). Managers of franchising companies from countries, which score high on uncertainty avoidance, tend to avoid uncertain situations and pursue control over operations and decisions (Erramilli, 1996). Franchisors feel reluctant to provide adaptation rights to local network partners to prevent adverse situations of brand name hijacking in environmental distant countries (Choo, 2001). Thus, we assume that franchising companies from countries, which score high on  and UA, will prefer standardization strategy, which enables them to exert decision-making control over critical value chain activities of the franchise system such as product mix and quality control. These considerations lead us to the formulation of the first hypothesis.  The international franchise headquarters’ degree of power distance and uncertainty avoidancenegatively influence the adaptation degree of its strategy. Transaction costs hypothesesUncertain business environment is characterized by constantly changing conditions such as of political systems, demand, and competition (Rajan and Pangarkar, 2000; Erramilli et. al, 2002; Brothers and Brothers 2003), and affect companies’ decisions of entry in new markets. The franchisor will pursue an adaptation strategy for franchise partners in order to flexibly modify standardized operating, product and/or service functions and to capture the profit potential in the volatile foreign environments (Boyle, 1999). Besides environmental uncertainty, the cultural differences between countries, such as norms, values, language and habits, hamper the transfer of standardized strategies to foreign countries and require adaptations to the local market environment. The greater the cultural distance between countries, the higher is the cultural uncertainty, and the more important is the franchisor’s strategy to adapt the franchise business model (e.g., operational business practices and personnel management practices) to the host country environment (Fladmoe-Lindquist, 1996; Alon and McKee, 1999).  This reasoning results in the following two hypotheses: H2a: Cultural uncertainty, due to cultural differences between the home country of the franchisor and the host country of the franchisee, positively influences the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.H2b: The environmental uncertainty in host countries positively influences the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.  Resource-based theory hypothesesAccording to the resource-based theory, “a firm is said to have a sustained competitive advantage when it is implementing a value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current potential competitor” (Barney, 1991, p. 120). In franchising competitive advantages can be created through combining the system-specific assets of franchisors with the local market knowledge and resources of franchisees(Windsperger, 2004). Franchise systems which derive competitive advantage from intangible system-specific assets, such as innovation capabilities or product knowledge, will transfer and exploit their system-specific assets to new markets without adapting them. On the other hand, when the franchisees’ local market knowhow and assets, such as local human resources or customer management competences, are critical to gaining a competitive advantage in the host country, then franchisors are more likely to use an adaptation strategy to capitalize on the franchisees' ability to adapt the franchise to the specifics of the country local market. Therefore, depending on the importance of the system-specific/local market assets for the value creation of the franchise brand, the franchisor will prefer a lower/higher degree of adaptation strategy in the host country. We can formulate the following hypotheses: H3a:Franchisor’s system-specific assets negatively influence the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.  H3b:Franchisees’ local market assets positively influence the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.  3. Empirical study 3.1. Data collection and measurement Our empirical study was conducted with data from international franchise firms headquartered in eight countries. We identified the international franchise firms with the support of national and international franchise associations of the countries of interest. In total, we contacted 2,713 companies. Starting in December 2014, we sent emails to the selected firms with an electronic link to the online questionnaire in several rounds of surveys. By June 2015, we completed the data collection process, resulting in a cleared data set of 162 international franchise systems headquartered in the US (24), UK (8), Germany (41), Austria (16), Netherlands (10), Italy (18), France (22), and Spain (23).  To test our hypotheses, we applied multiple regression method conducted via IBM SPSS. Table 2 provides an overview of the hypotheses and variables, which are used for testing of the research model (see Figure 1).

Regression analysis results The regression model is highly significant (p = .000, p < 0.05)Our model explains 17,6% (R² = 0.176) of the variance in adaptation degree of strategy. Power distance index (p = .003, ß = .267) (H1a), cultural uncertainty(p= .045, ß = -.185) (H2a), franchisor’s system specific assets (p = .006, ß = .211) (H3a) and franchisee's local assets (p = .006, ß = .199) (H3b) show significant impact on the choice of the international franchise strategy.  The first hypothesis is partly confirmed. The franchisor’s home country culture, i.e., measured by the degree of power distance, significantly impacts adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. However, the results are opposite to our hypothesis. Contrary to hypothesis (H1a), power distance (PD) positively influences adaptation strategy (p = 0.003, ß = .267). However, we find no significant relationship between adaptation strategy and uncertainty avoidance (UA) (p = .749). The regression results show a significant impact of cultural uncertainty adaptation strategy (p = .045, ß = -.185) but surprisingly with a converse result as predicted by our hypothesis (H2a). Cultural uncertainty negatively influences the degree of strategy adaption. Environmental uncertainty shows no significant impact on adaptation degree of franchising strategy (p = .106). Therefore, H2b is rejected.  The results of hypotheses H3a & H3b are significant. Resource-based factors significantly affect adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. Contrary to hypothesis (H3a), franchisor‘s system-specific assets positively impact choice of adaptation strategy (p = 0.006, ß = .211) and in alignment with H3b, the franchisee local assets positively influence choice of adaptation strategy (p = 0.010, ß = .199). 4. Discussion and conclusion Contrary to our hypothesis (H1a), power distance (PDI) positively influences the choice of the adaptation strategy by international franchising companies. Consequently, the higher the PD index of the franchising company‘s home country, the higher is the adaptation degree of strategy in host countries to which franchising company is expanding. Possible interpretation might be that strategies of franchising companies from countries with a high score on PD are difficult to transfer/implement in other countries. For example, human resources strategies from countries, which score high on PD might not be applicable in countries, which score low on PD, because employees of different cultural backgrounds are used to a different management approaches such as highly hierarchical management style versus flat hierarchies. Contrary to hypothesis H2a, cultural uncertainty has a negative, significant effect on adaptation degree of international franchising strategy. One possible interpretation is that franchisors who are unfamiliar with local cultures, norms and values are reluctant to accept changes to their standardized franchise business format due to a cognitive risk perception associated with adapting to the unknown, such as brand hijacking. Contrary to hypothesis (H3a), importance of franchisor‘s system-specific assets positively impact adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. Consequently, the more important the franchisor‘s system-specific assets for value creation, the higher is adaptation degree of strategy in host countries to which franchising companies are expanding. Possible interpretation might be that franchising companies with system-specific assets that are highly important in achieving competitive advantage need to adapt to local markets of host countries more than franchising companies, which do not possess highly important system-specific assets. The product or service of those firms might be highly dependent on e.g., local consumer preferences or local employee management. As hypothesized, importance franchisee‘s local assets (H3b) for value creation positively impacts the adaptation degree of strategy by franchisor in the host countries. High levels of local franchisee‘s know-how consequently results in higher necessity to use the adaptation strategy. In conclusion, Hofstede's power distance score has a newly discovered positive influence on adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. These finding calls for retesting the relationship on a different data sample, for example on data from Eastern or Asian countries, where power distance score can be particularly high. Managers of franchising companies from countries, which score high on power distance need to prepare for adaptation of their international franchising strategy when they expand to other countries/markets. Being aware of it in advance can save international franchising companies many efforts and financial expenses.  Franchising system-specific assets and local market assets are in a recursive relationship. Franchising companies, which have system-specific assets and are entering a business relationship with foreign franchisees, who possess local market knowledge, should pursue an adaptation strategy. In this case, the franchise managers have to adjust the system-specific knowhow to the local market environment in order to gain competitiveness when implementing the franchise business format in new or foreign markets.  This study has several limitations. Our data set consists of 162 international franchisors from eight countries. This data is a snapshot and is not a longitudinal study. The proportion of cases between countries and industries is unequal. Franchise headquarters are all located in developed countries, rather US or Western Europe. 5. Outlook to future research This paper tests the first Part I on the antecedents of international franchising strategy of the general research model shown in Figure 2.  Figure 2. General research model In franchising networks, centralized structure makes implementation of decisions by the franchisor easier. Thereby, one entity, i.e., the franchisor, makes the decisions and spreads it to international franchisees (Berkowitz and Wren, 2013). On the other hand, franchisors that transfer decision-making powers to franchisees can achieve a greater fit between strategy and structure (Xu et al., 2006). Transfer of centralized structure in franchising networks to other markets/countries via franchisees can cause minor decision-making power of franchisors (Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). Centralized structure in franchising is highly efficient in the enforcement of high-quality standards (Wu, 2015). Decentralization of decision-making in franchising networks makes it difficult for management to control the business standards and performance (Yin and Zajac, 2004). Decentralized structure in franchising networks require high control from franchisor HQ to establish fit between strategy and structure resulting in expected performance (Baena, 2012). According to the property rights, approach in franchising, structure of decision rights in franchising networks depends on intangible system-specific assets and the local market assets (Windsperger, 2004). International expansion of franchising companies leads to choice of governance mode such as wholly owned subsidiaries, joint venture franchising, area development franchising and master franchising (Konigsberg, 2008). Each of the governance modes are characterized by certain level of control in terms of ownership, decision, and residual income rights, which franchisor split between headquarter and international franchisees (Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger, 2014). The choice of efficient governance mode depends on the fit between strategy and structure, leading to improvement of performance in international franchising companies (Prajogo, 2016).  Previous studies in international franchising are unable to explain the fit between strategy, structure and organizational performance. Most of the studies have limitations due to the availability of data (Ahmady et al., 2016; Wilden et al., 2013; Baena and Cerviño, 2014). Therefore, this research project has three major goals: identification of antecedents for international franchising strategy, testing of strategy impact on franchising structure and investigation of interaction between strategy, structure and performancein international franchising context.  \n",

We argue that the threat of franchisor/franchisee joint employment and its vicarious liability will likely become binding precedent. Franchisors should put systems in place that will mitigate the risks associated with franchising.   Joint Employment and the Development of  Vicarious Liability in Franchising Introduction Without realizing it, all consumers have been to multiple franchises in every industry. Franchising is one of the most popular business models in the market today. While franchising is quite common in the restaurant and hotel industry, it is found in a multitude of industries in U.S. domestic and foreign markets. The symbiotic relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee has allowed for new legal precedents that inevitably create the need to make modifications to the model. In this paper, we argue that the concept of franchisor/franchisee joint employment and its vicarious liability will likely become binding precedent in the U.S. Therefore, franchisors should put systems in place that will mitigate the risks associated with franchising.   Literature Review Franchising is a business model designed to promote rapid expansion. A franchisee is someone who owns a franchise location. A franchisee's success and profit depends significantly on its own performance, but also on the performance of other franchisees. The franchisee operates as a separate legal entity. Franchising circumvents vertical and horizontal agency risks by replacing the employee-manager with a franchisee. While the concept has been around for centuries, the modern format has only become popular since World War II. Franchising                                                   Michael H. Seid, Where it All Began. The Evolution of FranchisingRANCHISE http://www.franchise-chat.com/resources/where_it_all_began_the_evolution_of_franchising.html (n.d.) augmented the rapid expansion that the U.S. market was facing in the 1950s and has continued to develop rapidly today largely under the same framework.Franchisees face life-cycles where they generally start out dependent on the expertise and established product/brand that the franchisor offers. Over time, they grow in their own expertise and develop ambition for more independence and wealth. They may procure it via purchasing more and more outlets, either multi-unit, multi-brand, or multi-system.Franchisors, on the other hand, are heavily influenced by the theory of resource scarcity during the early stages of a system’s existence. Under resource scarcity, franchising is a mechanism to ease financial and managerial constraints on growth, which aids in rapid business expansion. As can be expected, resource scarcity is most present early in the timeline of a franchise’s growth as the franchisor still relies on another agent’s resources to grow. Agency theory becomes more critical during the latter part of a franchise’s life-cycle. Under agency theory, franchising is a mechanism for improving alignment between the firm and outlet-level incentives. Agency theory comprises two classifications: vertical and horizontal. Vertical agency is the idea that employee-managers in company-owned outlets will shirk in order to get                                                   Jennifer S.

Conversely, horizontal agency is the idea that franchisees may free-ride on the brand-building efforts of others in order to draw in consumers.With agency theory, there are a few risks for the franchisor that come with signing a franchising contract. The risks occur either during the selection process or during the time spent operating together. Pre-contract, franchisee candidates may misrepresent themselves in order to get a better deal from the franchisor, otherwise known as adverse selection. Post signing the contract, the issue of “moral hazard” arises, where the residual claimant may cut corners.However, franchising may be the only business model to solve these issues; unlike with the chain business model, any franchisee shortcuts will cause a direct impact as the franchisees own units themselves. Franchising is based on a legal business contract, and the idea of being an independent owner alongside a partner is enticing; many entrepreneurs want to be their own boss and have their own business, but they also like the comfort that comes with the security of having a partner. They do not have to create a business model from scratch, as they have someone to train them on how to run this business; moreover, they believe that this same model was successful in a different unit.

Additionally, there are safeguards against the franchisor taking the franchisee out of business, as twenty-three states have established relationship laws that require franchisors to have “sufficiently good cause for terminating franchisees” or to “protect from arbitrary or baseless termination.” So, while the franchisee relies heavily on the franchisor for the franchisee’s potential and initial success, the franchisor is taking a risk by investing in this separate agent and trusting the franchisee with its brand.Rubin elaborates on the relationship between franchisor and franchisee and their economic and legal agreements. “The franchisor may provide various sorts of managerial assistance to the franchisee… [and] the franchisee will agree to run the business in a manner stipulated by the franchisor… [and] pay royalties, usually a percentage of sales to the franchisor.” Rubin goes on to state that “the franchisor has almost complete control over the behavior of the franchisee” and that the “definition of the franchisee as a separate firm, rather than as part of the franchisor, is a legal and not an economic distinction.”Franchisees act as independent owners, ones that franchisors do not wholly control like employees in corporations. Currently, the contracts and its operational standards reflect this, as the franchisor essentially just sets the standards that franchisees must operate by in the product or service. For restaurants, the franchisor determines how to prepare the food so the food tastes the                                                   Timothy Bates, Analysis of Survival Rates among Franchise and Independent Small Business Start-Ups, 33 J.

For hotels, they decide how frequently rooms are cleaned, the standards for cleanliness, and even the folding of towels and bedspreads so customers know what to expect from their hotel room regardless of location. However, in the U.S. franchisors set few standards in other areas, such as Human Resource policies. This means that the franchisee may design its own policies on hiring prerequisites, or how employees get promotions. While this allows a certain degree of autonomy for the franchisee, it also begs for scrutiny of two key concepts, namely vicarious liability and the recent notion of joint employment.  In the franchising world, the theory of joint employment focuses on the view that employees can have multiple employers under the same employment relationship. It is an employment arrangement many workers have been fighting for the courts to recognize. Importantly for franchise systems, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) issued its final rule defining join-employer status under the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”). This rule became effective April 27, 2020 and carried with it a more restrictive standard from the more expansive joint-employment view used in recent years. This new rule is very employer friendly, narrowing the definition of joint employer and providing a higher degree of certainty for business arrangements between companies. The new rule defines joint employer under the                                                   Marko Grünhagen et al., The Moderating Influence of HR Operational Autonomy on the Entrepreneurial Orientation-Performance Link in Franchise Systems, 10 INTREPRENEURSHIP GMT (2013)  Theodore P.

Id.  NLRA as “an employer who shares or codetermines another employer’s employees’ essential terms and conditions of employment.”However, this is a Trump administration NLRB decision that very likely will be revisited during President Joseph Biden’s tenure. Most impactful on franchising was the Browning-Ferris Industries case from 2015. In this decision, the NLRB expanded the joint-employer standard by holding that status as a join employer rested on the employer’s “reserved right to control employees as well as its indirect control over employees.” This relaxed the previous joint employment standard, potentially allowing employees to assert their right to bargain with both their direct employer as well as the company that contracted their services.There are two types of joint employment: horizontal and vertical. The Jackson Lewis firm defined horizontal joint employment as a structure “where the employee has employment relationships with two or more employers and the employers are sufficiently associated or related with respect to the employee such that they jointly employ the employee.” In contrast, vertical joint employment is defined as a structure “where the employee has an employment relationship with one employer (typically a staffing agency, subcontractor, labor contractor, or other intermediary employer) and the economic realities show that he or she is economically                                                  Id.  362 NLRB 1599 (2015).

Independent contractors are frequently put in a position where they are without protection of any workplace laws. By clarifying that the lead employer may also be responsible as a joint employer for the conditions of employment, the worker that was once without claims may have multiple avenues for relief.

This other employer, who typically contracts with the intermediary employer to receive the benefit of the employee’s labor, would be a potential joint employer.” Horizontally, such employees are sufficiently associated with both the franchisee and the franchisor. After all, the employees work at the franchisee’s location, and the uniform the employee wears has the franchisor’s logo and name on it. Vertically, the employee is economically dependent on the franchisee, as the franchisee location’s success is the source of the employee’s paycheck. The franchisee is also in a way dependent on the franchisor, for if the franchisor suffers financially or if the brand’s reputation is tarnished it may jeopardize the employee’s livelihood. If joint employment is accepted by the courts in any form, what impact would there be? With joint employment comes joint employer liability, also known as vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is when one party is held liable for the actions of a third party. This form of liability has existed since the middle ages and has had slight adjustments made to it throughout the centuries. Unfortunately, concepts that helped shape the law as it exists today were never fully updated to match modern business models leaving a great deal up to interpretation making finding vicarious liability largely incoherent. Vicarious liability has its roots in the middle ages, and “whereas modern law is founded on an action in negligence the mediaeval law was built around the forms of an action.” In the 1400s, the idea was that “an employer should be liable for an act that they had commanded,” whether it was to a serf or a servant was irrelevant. By                                                  Id.  Warren Swain, A Historical Examination of Vicarious Liability: A “Veritable Upas Tree”? 78 CAMBRIDGE J. 640 (2019). Id. Id. the late 1700s, the “principle of authority replaced that of command,” which gave room for a greater range for conduct as many servants were viewed to be part of the family and easily associated with their lords and masters. This idea is similar to how closely a franchisee’s employees are associated with the brand, and if they do any reprehensible acts, consumers and the media may easily create connotations with the whole franchise that can damage the brand’s reputation and the franchisee’s finances. Today, vicarious liability is “frequently central to the question of who pays compensation when a tort is committed. In most instances, an insurer indemnifies an employer or corporation.” Swain, writing for the Cambridge Law Journal, expanded upon the modern situation in Britain’s courts and the arguments for master’s and servant’s tort theories. He noted that while the United States might have different cases and court systems, they are intrinsically similar to the United Kingdom court system, with some changes. State and federal courts have been addressing joint employment liability over the past few years as lawsuits keep reaching higher and higher with their appeals. While the US Supreme Court has never heard a joint employment liability case, it is only a matter of time until it does and franchisors should do well to pay attention. Joint Ownership – Development and Arguments Are you an employee of the franchisor if you are an employee of the franchisee? You wear the franchisor’s logo, represent its brand, and see that its name is on your checks, but does                                                  Id. Id. Id. Id. it eliminate the authority and independence of the franchisee? And if something goes wrong, who can be held legally responsible? Franchisors frequently prioritize their brand as the most valuable asset they have and have to balance protecting their product and service standards with not exercising excessive control over franchisee operations and employee’s day-to-day actions. This difficult balance is where the lines blur, and where loopholes might come into play in litigation and liability lawsuits. Lawsuits that are filed against an individual franchisee can only be brought against the franchisor if the tort occurs where the franchisor had a hand in determining the franchise-wide policy, and in Swain’s words, an “action in negligence.” “For decades, franchisors could be held liable under a theory of vicarious liability if they exercised direct and immediate control over day-to-day employment matters.” such as how many employees are in each role and the standard of the product or service.One of the most infamous court cases against a franchise is Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants Liebeck is a milestone in US tort law and reforms of the time. Liebeck sued the franchise for requiring all units to keep the coffee well above scalding when sold to customers, as it was a health and safety risk. This was the policy because it kept the coffee tasting fresher for longer, making it possible for the company to sell the same pot for longer without having to                                                   Michael Brennan et al., Joint Liability for Franchisors: Employment, Vicarious Liability, Statutory and Other Liabilities, 14 I OF RANCHISING L. 3 (2016)  John T.

Multiple consumers had received third-degree burns from it, and Liebeck herself had her skirt melt onto her skin in her pelvic region, landing her in the hospital for over a week. The court held that the franchisor (McDonald’s) was responsible for the injuries because it was a cross-unit policy, not a rule of the one franchisee. This also meant that the plaintiff was entitled to a higher settlement for damages.  Liebeck v. McDonald’s Restaurants became well-known as a case of frivolous litigation. All to-go coffee cups are now labeled “Caution: Hot” to avoid future lawsuits against coffee-selling franchises. The media handled the case report with derision, and the general population views it as a joke. The case is the best smear campaign McDonald’s could have crafted, as now most of its customers do not think the company was in the wrong. However, Liebeck’s case is one of the very few that managed to get through the lower courts and one of the even fewer that resulted in a win for the plaintiff customer. The franchisor was responsible because McDonald's policy was to serve the coffee at the dangerously scalding temperature. Other such cases do not hold the franchisor responsible, as they usually deal with aspects of operations that are up to the individual franchisee, such as human resources. This brings us back to joint employment and vicarious liability. If franchises were to adopt and utilize joint employment, then the franchisor would have a higher risk of being sued by employees and potentially being held liable for violations committed by those entities.

The Famous McDonald’s Coffee CaseOAN  (Oct. 24, 2018), https://www.thedoanlawfirm.com/blog/2018/october/the-famous-mcdonalds-coffee-case/Currently, franchisors are at risk of joint-employer liability from their franchisees' employees.Some of the examples Lewis gives of the risk pertain to federal law violations that could come from a franchisee’s employee or the franchisee themselves.One such example is a hotel chain where one of its franchisees was being held accountable for immigration violations. The violation was committed by the franchisee’s custodial services vendor who employed undocumented workers. Many believe that it is ridiculous to expect that the franchisor could have even known any immigration violations might be occurring, as the franchise is too large to manage every little aspect. However, there may be more precedents when dealing with an employment discrimination lawsuit that violates statutes like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where there are additional clauses in the law to protect certain minorities. Joint employment status determines if an organization’s workers can have a union representation election under the National Labor Relations Act, as well as who would be held responsible in a court of law for unfair labor practices. An additional example Adler-Paindiris gives is that “a national fast-food franchisor may face exposure in a systemic disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) if a franchise adheres to a strict ‘100-percent healed’ policy.” Eighteen states have enacted legislation in response to ‘joint employer’ concerns, mostly by adding the distinction that a franchisee does not qualify as a franchisor’s employee, and so vertical joint                                                   Adler-Paindiris, supra note 29. Id. Id. at 4. Id.  liability cannot occur. If the United States Supreme Court ever gives a ruling on the matter, the ruling would trump whatever the states held previously per the Supremacy Clause. Child abuse, like that found in high profile child molestation cases against the Church, has raised difficult issues about the degree to which an employer should be held liable for the criminal activity of an employee. However, to pull on that string brings with it the risk of unraveling a great deal more than intended or that can be controlled in a manageable way. One of the biggest questions that comes with joint employment is, how far does it extend? And what is the correct balance between control and risk avoidance? Lewis stated that “while a wholly ‘hands-off’ strategy might be optimal for purposes of risk avoidance, it’s likely unrealistic from a business perspective.” Will joint employment liability be impacted by whether or not the franchisor actually utilizes its right to control? Technically, “the franchisor has almost complete control over the behavior of the franchise,” but they do not necessarily utilize it. There is a patchwork of different tests in determining a relationship to be a joint employer, as jurisdictions have enacted their own statutes. The first and most common analysis is the right-to-control test, which asks whether the putative employer has the right to control the means and manner in which an employee’s work is done. Factors in the analysis look at whether the purported employer has control over the hiring and firing, compensation and training, and supervision over day-to-day activities of the employee.  Alternatively, a separate                                                   Grow, supra note 41.  Swain, supra noteId.  Rubin, supra note 18.   Adler-Paindiris, supra note 29. Id. test that commonly arises in wage-hour cases is the economic realities test. This test looks at the “economic realities” of the relationship between employees and the putative joint employer to determine whether there is a joint employer relationship. Courts look to the purported employer’s ability to permit the employee to work, assessing the degree of control it has over the work conditions and method of payment. Other key factors include the amount of skill required by the employee in performing the job duties.The argument for joint employment and vicarious liability is that, if a lawsuit is filed, the plaintiff will want access to the franchisor’s deeper pockets. In addition to this, if a lawsuit is brought on grounds that could affect a multitude or even all of the different franchise units, it is not unreasonable to assume that the same issues and violations may be happening to others in the same position. Some employees believe they have a moral obligation to change the franchise standards to protect others and themselves from it happening again. This brings about the question of who should be held accountable for unjust actions.  That being said, on paper joint-employment and vicarious liability might seem reasonable. What is the degree of liability that would be practical to impose in real-world practice? As stated earlier, many believe it would be unreasonable for the franchisor to be expected to know every occurrence in its franchised units. That is why the franchisee was brought-in as an independent partner to be in charge of all management and success of the franchisee’s business. The larger a franchise gets, the harder and harder it would be for the                                                  Id. Id. Id.  Randall K.

Because of this, some plaintiffs have lawyers that argued in favor of an agency theory of liability rather than the pure joint-employment design. One case argued that the franchisor had “reserved power to impose broad discretionary control over the franchisee [which] plausibly created agency theory.”federal court refused to dismiss sexual-harassment claims against a national fast-food chain in this case. It based this argument on the fact that the employee signed the franchisor’s conduct policy, which, inter alia, established an employment relationship with the corporate franchisor.What sort of standards could be created to establish a form of joint liability that would remain fair to all parties involved? Where would the standards be crafted? What new protections will have to be put into place?  Discussion of Joint Employment Liability Today In 2014, the California Supreme Court heard Patterson v. Domino's Pizza, LLC, a case concerning employer liability for sexual harassment. Taylor Patterson was a female employee who raised allegations against her male supervisor, an assistant store manager, who, whenever  they shared the same shift, “made lewd comments and gestures [toward Patterson], and grabbed her breasts and buttocks.” After reporting the incident to the franchise owner, she had her hours                                                  Id.

She sued Domino’s based on the acts of sexual harassment as well as the franchisee’s failure to take measured actions to remedy the harassing behavior.” Claims were brought against the franchisor under the legal theory that the franchisor was the actual employer of the plaintiff and the assistant store manager or, in the alternative, that the franchisee was the agent of the franchisor, meaning that the franchisor was ultimately responsible for the actions of the male supervisor.”While the lower court ruled in Domino’s favor, the appellate court reversed. The appeals court found that these operational standards, and the comments of the Domino’s representative to Sui Juris [the franchisee] that the franchise had to get rid of the assistant manager, arguably created an agency relationship, potentially subjecting Domino’s Pizza to vicarious liability. The California Supreme Court reversed the holding of the appellate court, finding that the operational and marketing plans that are part of the franchise agreement do not create agency or employment relationships with those individuals who are hired by the franchisee.” In layman’s terms, the Californian courts believe there is reason to debate and reexamine the franchise’s relationships on all levels in a modern setting, and in theory Patterson was only one step away from having her case examined by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014. The individual contracts of that Domino’s unit determined who was responsible for training employees and the hiring and firing process as the franchisor usually does not have control over HR matters.

Now Applebee's and IHOP are the two chains with the most claims against them with four each. Many of these workers stated that they believed their claim would not be heard or hold much weight as they are viewed as expendable employees due to their lower social and financial status. One of these workers was a sixteen-year-old from the St. Louis area who worked at IHOP as part of a high school program in order to graduate. The general manager, Rami Ramadan, allegedly groped her and eventually turned to threats and demands for sex. Male and female employees at a nearby IHOP reported similar behavior from cooks at their location, and complaints were “laughed off” by the owner of both locations, Khalid Ramadan, who is brother to the general manager. Many similar accounts come from IHOP and Applebee’s locations from coast to coast from men, women, and under-age employees, but there is no response from the franchisees, and these are only those reported and filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).Forbes magazine recently identified cybersecurity and sexual harassment claims as two of the largest threats to businesses as 2018 “had sexual harassment complaints to EEOC                                                    Alexia F.

N.T. v. Taco Bell Corp. U.S. District Court Judge John W. Broomes granted Taco Bell’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed claims based on sexual assault and Taco Bell's negligence. The plaintiff stated that, although the franchise knew there was a risk for sexual assault, itfailed [to] institute any policies and procedures its franchises are required to follow, which seek to prevent sexual assault in the workplace,” and that Taco Bell has “duties to provide rules regarding the operation of franchises, to ensure that the franchises are safe working environments, and to disclose the known defects and risks of operating a Taco Bell restaurant.” The judge dismissed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff could not prove any duty the franchise had to the franchisee’s employee.

In 2019, the National Public Radio reported on a McDonald’s unit in Mason, Michigan that had over 50 women, including former employee Jenna Ries, as a part of a class-action suit against the store manager for sexual harassment, joining a multitude of cases pertaining to fast-food workers in franchises being sexually harassed and assaulted by supervisors. Despite McDonald’s issuing statements about its plans to implement new anti-harassment training, the lawsuit says, “the corporation, too, has failed to address the ‘systemic sexual harassment’ and therefore enabled it.” The company faced staged protests by its workers in May 2020, and many more women have joined in ongoing sexual harassment actions, now both in Michigan as well as a sexual harassment class action against McDonald’s on behalf of employees or former employees at more than 100 company-owned McDonald’s restaurants.What is interesting is that in November 2019, McDonald’s terminated its popular CEO, Stephen Easterbrook, with a multi-million severance package for having, reportedly, solely consensual relationship with a female employee. This was against McDonald’s current company policy, which “prohibits employees who ‘have a direct or indirect reporting relationship’ with one another from dating or having a sexual relationship.” A stereotype in                                                   Alina Selyukh, McDonald’s Sued Over ‘Systematic Sexual Harassment’ of Female EmployeesNPR (Nov. 12, 2019), https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/778530312/mcdonalds-is-sued-over-systemic-sexual-harassment-of-female-workers.More Women Come Forward, Allege ‘Unchecked’ Sexual Harassment By Management Of Teenage Workers Employed At McDonald’s, WNYABOR ODAY (June 23, 2020), https://www.wnylabortoday.com/news/2020/06/23/new-york-city-labor-news/more-women-come-forward-allege-unchecked-sexual-harassment-by-management-of-teenage-workers-employed-at-mcdonald-s/.

McDonald’s was willing to lose its CEO to maintain its policy to protect themselves from any financial or legal repercussions, but not willing to act when the conduct of its store managers was called into question. Why are many franchises failing to address the proliferation of sexual assault claims filed against their franchisees hundreds of men, women, and even minors? Data (Graph on next page) show that the category, “Accommodation and food services,” which includes the most popular industries for franchises, has the highest number of sexual harassment charges. Finally, large franchisors, may be taking even more aggressive measures to counter the harassment.Implications In all 50 states over the years, the potential for joint employment liability to be legally recognized and reinforced in franchises had been increasing due to the over-abundance of sexual harassment claims that resulted from the #MeToo movement. For the franchise sector, this is a powder keg just waiting to explode, as the cases with every variety of circumstances keep progressing just a little bit further up the court ladder. Inevitably, many cases involve minors. Surely it is only a matter of time until a case advances to an appellate court: A case with the right plaintiff and a set of circumstances for which the franchisor can be decreed liable.

When a “correct formula” prevails, there will be a precedent for all  the other cases calling for joint employment. Joint employment’s vertical liability will be much more likely to win cases and all of the money that comes with it. No matter how expensive it may seem to fund finding a functioning solution to protect employee’s rights and, therefore, the franchise’s wallet from future legal actions, it will be incomparably more expensive to pay off all of those future claims. Franchises are already a delicate composition of control and independence that makes up a large portion of the international market and economy. Economists have no way of anticipating how far the effect joint employment might make on the industry. Also, economists do not know how far joint employment will reach if vertical liability is established before franchises have the chance to build a shield, like the way Walmart did with its no-gun policy against future shootings.  Future Research This study concludes with a summons to research. We need to know just how much of the U.S. economy is wrapped up in franchises, and how much the economy depends on the amount of revenue they generate. We also need to know, more than anything else, what could be done to prevent wrongful franchisee misbehaviour and unfair franchise control of the economy? What is a feasible solution? Are there precedents for solutions elsewhere, like Australia’s Fair Work Act with special provisions for franchises? The protesting McDonald’s franchisee employees say that the webinars and training sessions they are trying to implement are not enough to have an impact on what has been a standard of harassment. The question then is, what would be sufficient and effective? Are there existing laws in the U.S. that can be expanded, such as anti-discrimination legislation? And should legislation cut both ways, i.e. offer protection in both directions so franchisees are also protected from abuses by franchisors?                                                   Tess Hardy, Working for the Brand: The Regulation of Employment in Franchise Systems in Australia48 AUSTRALIAN . 234 (2020) Does the franchisee sign a code of conduct alongside its employees? It is a legally binding document, and slight adjustments to the wording here or there would give room for franchises to correct the source of these issues while still providing a barrier against a lawsuit. These questions are present while potential major changes in labor policy loom. Should there be a simple addition to the contract that a franchisee signs in the Human Resource section stating a zero-tolerance policy for harassment? How would they enforce that? Should there be fail-safes put in place pertaining to a situation such as the Ramadans in southern Illinois with IHOP, where one negligent franchisee owns multiple units? There is undeniably a greater threat from someone who owns multiple units to the brand and to employee safety than from someone who owns one unit, so is there a way to remove the franchisee if there are enough claims against the franchisee? Should a clause be added to the franchise agreement allowing for franchisors to terminate the franchise agreement if the franchisee is enough claims against the franchisee or if the franchisee is found liable for sexual harassment? Not to mention the question of how likely it is for sexual harassment to be the only issue in those locations in such a situation. Or, in the most radical of solutions, should franchisors establish company by company or as an industry as a whole joint employment liability themselves? Rather than wait for the Supreme Court to create the standard - declaring “open season” on franchisors and their wallets - franchisors could control the narrative and ensure more beneficial results by taking proactive action.  Which would be more practical? What would be easiest? What would be the most effective? And do any of the answers overlap? These are questions franchisors need to be asking themselves now before they lose control of the situation entirely. \n",

Sustainability and green practices: The role of stakeholder power in fast food franchise chains Structured abstract Purpose: This paper explores how the power of salient stakeholders involved in the green waste management of franchise chains can impact the ability of the chains to change their green practices.  Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study is based on interviews data from 19 franchisors and their head office staff, operating in the fast food sector in France where franchise chains have been ‘named and shamed’ as continuing to ignore waste management regulation. Findings: Our findings suggest that both the form and bases of power of different stakeholder groups have important implications for the implementation of green practices, even those required by law. We find that the franchisees’ central network position alters the ability of franchisors to directly engage in dialog, consult with, and educate key stakeholders, creating additional challenges for franchisors in the implementation process.  Originality: Our study is the first to consider the role of stakeholders in the implementation of green practices in franchise chains. By examining franchise chains, we provide new insights into the role an additional stakeholder, that of franchisees, and enrich the literature on green practices in the hospitality sector.  Keywords Green practices, waste management, stakeholder power, franchising, fast food.Introduction The increasing concern over environmental issues means that firms are subject to ever greater scrutiny of their green practices (Baah et al., 2020). This is just not limited to industrial sectors historically associated with pollution, but also service sector organizations such as hospitality firms (Chan and Hsu, 2016). The public as well as regulators have become increasingly aware of the environmental impacts of the hospitality industry, with respect to issues such as energy use, generation of waste, and water usage (Aragon-Correa et al., 2015). Perhaps in response to the increasing scrutiny the sector is experiencing, we have seen an increase in hospitality studies exploring sustainability issues, from sustainable development approaches and implementation (Ertuna et al., 2019; Filimonau et al., 2019a; Prud’homme and Raymond, 2016), motivations for sustainable practices and environmental management engagement (Novacka et al., 2019), green marketing (Jones et al., 2014; Rivera‐Camino, 2007), and outcomes associated with greening activities (Kularatne et al., 2019; Park et al., 2017).  Despite the acknowledged importance of stakeholders in environmental strategy formation and implementation (Hart, 1995; Aykol and Leonidou, 2015), the role of stakeholders in environmental management has received less interest from hospitality researchers (Chan and Hsu, 2016). It is this key role of stakeholders which our paper seeks to explore. We do so in the context of franchise organizations, where even less is known about how stakeholders influence green practice implementation. Franchising introduces additional stakeholders, most notably franchisees, as well as employees of franchisees, local communities, and the local governments where franchisees operate their units (Kim and Lee, 2020). Franchise chains, therefore, may be subject to potentially different types and intensity of stakeholder responses and pressures compared with other types of organization. Whilst franchisees, as residual agents, may be believed to have interests more closely aligned with their franchisor compared with employee managers (Combs et al., 2009), which could potentially facilitate green practice implementation (Hörisch et al., 2014), such alignment cannot be assumed, as franchisees may be primarily concerned with the short term profitability of their own units, rather than the longer term sustainability of the chain (Barthélemy, 2011). Furthermore, the pivotal position franchisees hold within the network, given their interactions with employees, customers and other stakeholders, means that the franchisor may find it more challenging to manage their relationship with other stakeholders who are instrumental in greening activities. The aim of our paper is, therefore, to explore how key stakeholders can impact the ability of franchisors to implement green practices in their chain restaurants. The empirical study deals with the specific green practice of waste management within the context of the French market. Waste management is of considerable importance in the fast food sector, with an estimated 1 kg of waste produced daily by an average consumer of hospitality services within Europe (Bohdanowicz, 2006).  It is also subject to regulation within Europe. We focus on fast food franchise chains operating in France given the French government’s recent ‘naming and shaming’ of major fast food chains, who three years after its introduction, were still not in compliance with a governmental decree obliging companies that generate more than 1,100 litres of waste per week to sort and recycle it according to five streams (‘Tri 5 Flux’): paper, plastic, metal, glass, and wood, and to separate biodegradable waste from all other waste (ADEME, 2017). In early 2019, the French Secretary of State for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition (Brune Poirson) summoned the executives of all the major fast food chains operating in France to discuss their waste management, asserting that there had been “…zero effort in terms of sorting non-food waste”. Following this meeting, the government introduced a three-year compliance plan for fast-food chains, where at least 70% of restaurants must be compliant by 31 December 2019, 90% by 31 December 2020, and 100% by 31 December 2021 (Gouvernement, 2020). Thus, the French market is a particularly interesting context in which to explore waste management practices and regulation effects within franchise chains.  From the French experience, it would seem that despite regulatory obligations, fast food franchise chains have been either unwilling or unable to change their waste management practices, which leads us to question why this might be the case. What role do different                                                             Separation of biodegradable waste is only required for those companies which produce more than 10 tons of biodegradable waste, or more than 60 liters of edible oil waste per year. https://www.leparisien.fr/societe/tri-des-dechets-les-fast-foods-rappeles-a-l-ordre-31-01-2019-8000793.php  There are no available statistics as to whether fast food companies have met this requirement, although a study by ‘#ZerodéchetauMcDo’ (Zero Waste McDonalds) found that just 36% of McDonald’s outlets had sorting facilities in their restaurants (https://www.actu-environnement.com/ae/news/restauration-rapide-tri-dechets-salle-peu-progres-34906.php4). stakeholders play in enabling/inhibiting the implementation of green waste management practices? To address these questions, we undertook a qualitative study comprising 19 interviews with franchisors and their head office staff operating in the fast food sector in France. As stakeholder theory puts “people at the centre of the story” (Freeman et al.2020, p. 224), a qualitative approach was believed most appropriate as it enables the researcher to gather richer data that is grounded in the real-life experiences of people (Altinay et al., 2013). We focus on franchisor perspectives given they represent the focal organization who are ultimately responsible for the implementation of waste management practices and answerable to government. It is their perception of the situation that drives their behaviors and responses in relation to their stakeholders and implementation activities. Our findings suggest that the achievement of green waste management depends on the commitment of various stakeholders: local government, suppliers, franchisees, franchisee employees, and customers. Franchisees through their network position have a critical role. We find both the source of power and forms of power vary between different stakeholder groups, with the government primarily relying on coercive authority to compel franchisors to improve their waste management, whilst other stakeholders, through their competence and legitimate authority are able to inhibit, or at least slow implementation due to their position within the network.  Our research makes several contributions. Firstly, we enrich the stream of literature on green practices in franchise organizations. Research which has considered green management practices within franchise chains is limited, despite their important economic contribution particularly within the hospitality sector (Combs et al., 2004; Preble et al., 2000). There are some studies of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in franchise chains (Choi and Lee, 2018; Jell-Ojobor, 2019, Meiseberg and Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015) but these have tended to focus on outcomes, rather than process. For example, both Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012) and Jell-Ojobor (2019) investigated how CSR activities impact performance outcomes, whilst Perrigot et al.(2015) explored the impact of franchise chain size and proportion of franchised units on CSR reporting on franchisor websites. Interestingly, both Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012) and Perrigot et al. (2015) found that CSR activities/disclosures diminished as the proportion of franchised outlets rises. Similarly, Choi and Lee (2018) in their study of the relationship between financial performance and corporate social performance found that although a positive relationship between financial performance and corporate social performance was present, this positive relationship dwindled the greater the proportion of franchised units. Whilst it is possible to infer from these findings that the additional stakeholders associated with franchise chains (most notably franchisees) inhibit the franchisor’s ability (or desire) to implement sustainable practices, if/how this occurs has yet to be explored. Secondly, we contribute to stakeholder identification and salience theory by focusing on its most influential attribute, that of power (Mitchell et al., 1997; Parent and Deephouse, 2007) and how it might influence implementation of green practices. Whilst prior literature has explored how stakeholders may contribute to green strategy development (Lyon et al., 2017; Polonsky, 1995; Rivera‐Camino, 2007), how stakeholder power affects implementation has received less attention (Bondy, 2008), especially where the green practices being adopted have largely been imposed upon the sector through regulation rather than voluntary initiatives. Further, as identified by Kim et al. (2017) the role of different stakeholders in implementing green practices in the hospitality sector is under researched. Given the increasing scrutiny hospitality firms are under in relation to their environmental performance, this is an important area of study. Finally, our research also contributes to practice and policy. The study can help franchisors to better assess the multiplicity and respective powers of stakeholders required to achieve better waste management. For government, it can enable understanding of how to involve other stakeholders to ensure effective environmental legislation.  Stakeholder Theory Stakeholder theory is one of the key approaches used in social, environmental and sustainability management research (Hörisch et al., 2014). Whilst stakeholder theory proposes that a firm may be affected by, or conversely affect stakeholders, the majority of studies drawing on stakeholder theory have focused on how pressure from various stakeholder groups may motivate organizations to engage in green activities (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Perez-Batres et al., 2012; Sulkowski et al., 2018). This perhaps reflects an interpretation of sustainability management more aligned with CSR, given these two concepts are often referred to interchangeably (Bansal and Song, 2017). Sustainability management is defined as “the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of both environmental and socioeconomic sustainability-related decisions and actions” (Starik and Kanashiro, 2013, p. 12) whilst CSR explicitly refers to the firm’s consideration of, and response to, social responsibility beyond that required by law (Montiel, 2008). The voluntariness explicit in CSR has provoked an interest in why some firms are more proactive in their search for solutions to social and environmental problems than others, and the influence of stakeholders in this.  Our focus is thus somewhat different, given we consider the case of a sustainability practice required by law. We seek to understand how stakeholder relationships impact organizational responses to the regulation, focusing on the relative power of different stakeholders and the extent to which this impacts their cooperation and therefore the organization’s ability (and willingness) to comply. Stakeholders are “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization’s objectives” (Freeman, 1984, p. 46), and therefore are not homogenous in their values, objectives, or influence (Polonsky, 1995). It is therefore important to understand how managers determine which stakeholders are salient.  Mitchell et al. (1997, p. 854) propose that stakeholder salience can be determined by their “possession of one, two, or all three of the following attributes: (1) the stakeholder’s power to influence the firm, (2) the legitimacy of the stakeholder’s relationship with the firm, and (3) the urgency of the stakeholder’s claim on the firm”. Of these three attributes, our focus in this paper is on how stakeholder power influences waste management strategy implementation. We do so for several reasons. Firstly, organizations are assumed to manage their stakeholder relationships with an emphasis on stakeholder power (Rasi et al., 2014), and this attribute has been deemed to be the most influential by various authors (Mitchell et al., 1997; Parent and Deephouse, 2007). Secondly, urgency of claims by different stakeholders can be presumed here, given that fast food chains have been subject to waste management regulation for almost five years, and are now under considerable pressure to comply. Thirdly, we do not attempt to consider how all stakeholders may influence waste management implementation, but rather explore how those stakeholders identified by franchise chains as being influential have played a role in the implementation of waste management practices. We thus presume franchisors will only identify those stakeholders whom they consider to be legitimate.  Whilst power has several definitions (Mitchell et al., 1997), it is socially constituted and can broadly be defined in terms of influence (French and Raven, 1959). It is the “relationship among social actors in which one social actor, A, can get another social actor, B, to do something that B would not otherwise have done” (Pfeffer, 1981, p. 3). Stakeholders have varying degrees of power to influence other stakeholders to act in a way that they otherwise would not, or indeed to prevent them from acting in a way which they would otherwise wish to do. The extent to which a stakeholder holds power has been explained in reference to two key sources of power: (1) the resources that a stakeholder possesses that are critical to the focal organization (Pfeffer, 1992), that is resource dependency; and (2) their network position (Rowley, 1997).   Resource dependency theory explores how the possession of tangible (e.g., money or infrastructure) or intangible (e.g., knowledge or skills) critical resources can provide stakeholders with power if they are able to regulate or control access, possession, allocation and use of such resources (Tiew et al., 2015). Whilst resource dependency focuses on the nature of the resource relationship, the network perspective of power suggests that the position of the stakeholder (with respect to other stakeholders and the focal organization) also has implications for the power a stakeholder possesses (Pajunen, 2006). Thus, network power “refers to power obtained through the network’s structure, as opposed to power gained through individual attributes” (Rowley, 1997, p. 898). Although network centrality (or power) is determined from three components (Freeman, 1979; Rowley, 1997): degree (number of direct links to other network members), closeness (independent access to others) and betweenness (the position of a stakeholder positioned between other stakeholders), we focus on betweenness centrality, given it is the most appropriate component for measuring the ability to control resources and information across a network (Pajunen, 2006). Several studies have suggested that to fully understand the power position of a stakeholder, using a dual approach by considering both resource dependency and network centrality, is appropriate to best understand a stakeholder influence within a network (Hazra et al., 2017; Pajunen, 2006; Tiew et al.2015). Thus, in order to explore the influence of different stakeholder groups on the implementation of green practices, we consider both resource and network-based sources of power. In addition to considering source of power, there have been several categorizations of forms of power (e.g., Etzioni, 1961; Raven and French, 1958). We draw on the typology developed by Wrong (1979) as this is the most common in tourism and hospitality contexts (see e.g., Beritelli and Laesser, 2011; Marzano and Scott, 2009; Saito and Ruhanen, 2017). Wrong (1979) suggests that power can be conceptualized in four ways: force, manipulation, persuasion and authority. Force refers to “the creation of physical obstacles restricting the freedom of another” (Wrong, 1979, p. 24). Manipulation refers to “acts of negotiation that involve a measure of distortion, deception or exploitation” (Few, 2002, p. 35). Persuasion is similar to manipulation, but lacks negative connotations (Marzano and Scott, 2009), and includes advertising rhetoric (Wrong, 1979). Authority is defined as the “institutional code within which the use of power is organized and legitimized” (Parsons, 1963, p. 243). Authority is a particularly apposite form of power as it is deemed the relevant mechanism for “exercising intended influence in an inter-institutional context” (Beritelli and Laesser, 2011, p. 1300).  Authority has been further conceptualized as comprising four components – coercive, induced, legitimate and competent authority. Coercive authority refers to the extent to which an agent is believed to have authority to punish another stakeholder if they fail to conform to the influence attempt (French and Raven, 1959). Induced authority can be seen as the opposite of coercion, and involves one stakeholder’s use of material rewards to entice another stakeholder to comply (Wrong, 1979). Under legitimate authority, “the power holder possesses an acknowledged right to command and the power subject and acknowledged obligation to obey” (Wrong, 1979, p. 49), and is associated with a feeling of ‘oughtness’ (French and Raven, 2001). Competence authority is exerted when one stakeholder uses their expertise to influence other actors (Saito and Ruhanen, 2017). In examining the influence of different stakeholder groups on the implementation of green waste management practices, we consider the role of both the source (bases) and form of power that different stakeholder groups possess on the implementation process. We thus extend previous studies, which focus on either source (Hein et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018) or form (Harness et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2019; Roome and Wijen, 2006). Furthermore, there is little research which considers how organizations respond to regulations which require a change in green practices. Perhaps there is an assumption that organizations will comply. The recent case in France, however, suggests that franchise chains are either unwilling or unable to comply. In either case, this might mean that fast food franchise chains believe their salient stakeholders do not have the power or inclination to punish them for non-compliance, or the stakeholders are using their power to inhibit the franchisors’ ability to implement the necessary changes. This becomes even more complex as franchising leads to the creation of further groups of stakeholders, as emphasized by Kim and Lee (2020). Methodology Our research was guided by a constructivism paradigm where reality is socially constructed, and thus context is deemed to have an important role in theory development (Bogna et al., 2020). A qualitative approach was adopted, based on in-depth interviews with fast food chain franchisors and their head office staff operating in France. Qualitative approaches are increasingly being used in franchising studies (e.g., Doherty, 2009; Watson et al., 2020) and studies of green practices (Bondy, 2008; Lin et al., 2019; Roome and Wijen, 2006). A qualitative research method was believed to be the most appropriate, as it enables data to be gathered that is grounded in the real-life experiences of people (Altinay et al., 2013). The subjective nature of qualitative research methods “allows researchers to better understand and interpret the depth of responses and respondents’ opinions about creating and maintaining their social realities” (Grünhagen et al., 2020, p. 6). In this regard, we limited our sample to franchisors, given it is they who are ultimately responsible for compliance with green waste regulation, and therefore it is their social reality which is our concern. Their perceptions may not reflect an objective reality, but it is what drives their actions. Thus, a qualitative research approach enables us to build an in-depth understanding of how and why organizational members view an issue as they do, and the ways they behave as a result (Walsh, 2003). France was chosen as a particularly relevant context for several reasons. Firstly, the government’s public ‘naming and shaming’ of fast food chains who have not complied with waste sorting regulation highlights that regulation alone does not necessarily create change in environmental practice. This provided an opportunity to explore why this might be the case, and the potential influence of different stakeholder groups. Secondly, France is one of the leading markets for franchising in the world, with 1,927 franchisors, 78,032 franchised units, sales of 63.88 billion euros and 668,837 direct and indirect jobs (French Franchise Federation, 2021). Thirdly, franchising is particularly developed in the fast food sector both internationally, but also within France, with 208 domestic and foreign (mainly US) chains operating within France, represented by 6,658 franchised restaurant outlets and revenues of 5.42 billion euros (French Franchise Federation, 2021). Data CollectionOur sample of 19 franchisors and their head office staff (representing 17 different chains) were selected through a combination of purposive and snowball sampling, an approach often used in qualitative franchise studies (Doherty, 2009; Watson et al., 2020). Respondents were selected based on their position within the network affording them insights into the implementation of waste management practices, and the role of different stakeholder groups. Recruitment of participants ceased when no new themes were emerging from the data collected – i.e., when data saturation was achieved. Boddy (2016) suggests that saturation is typically achieved by 12 interviews, and that samples over 30 are likely to be too unwieldly to analyse. Our sample size is of similar magnitude to other hospitality studies (e.g., Filimonau et al., 2019b, Crawford, 2013) and stakeholder research (e.g., Tiew et al., 2015, Lin et al., 2018). The respondents, on average, had been in post for 5 years (tenure ranged from 1-16 years). The sample included representatives from chains of various sizes, and fast-food sectors (cuisines). The interviews were semi-structured in nature and began by asking the respondents about their current waste management practices, and how their chain has responded to the five-stream sorting mandated by the French government. We then asked questions designed to explore the role of both internal as well as external stakeholders in the waste management process, and the impact of green waste management practices on their business. Table 1 provides the interview guide. Most interviews were conducted by phone for reasons of geographical distance, and all were audio-recorded. The interviews were conducted in French and then transcribed. The total length of the interviews was 14 hours 34 minutes, for an average of 48 minutes. Details of the participants are provided in Table 2. <<Insert Tables 1 and 2>> Data Analysis To interpret the data, we used an abductive analytical approach, such that the analytical process moved back and forth between theory and data (Hahn and Ince, 2016). We analysed the data in three key stages, using an approach recommended by Corley and Gioia (2004). In the first stage, an open coding approach was used, where initial concepts were identified, and grouped into categories using descriptive coding, under the broad themes of the interview questions. We focused on identifying the stakeholder involved, the nature of their involvement, and their influence. The data was initially analyzed in French, before being translated, and the codes reviewed by a second coder. In the second stage (axial coding), we searched for relationships between and among these categories, to create higher order themes, navigating between the data-driven codes and the theory (Timmermans and Tavory, 2012). This stage was conducted by the first coder in French, and then reviewed using the translated text by a second coder (after back translation checks). The creation of a dataset in both languages (French and English) increased reliability and construct validity (Altinay et al., 2013). In the final stage (dimensional coding), the themes were gathered into overarching dimensions. Table 3 provides some examples of this process. This three stage approach was undertaken to enhance internal validity (Altinay et al., 2013). Furthermore, by having one author code in the native language, with checks made by the second coder from the translated data, it meant that where disagreements existed, translation issues could be easily identified and validity enhanced. The examination of data by two coders also helped alleviate inductive bias (Miles and Huberman, 1994). Test for interrater reliability found Cohen’s Kappa at 0.8, indicating substantial agreement between coders (McHugh, 2012). Where disagreements existed, inconsistencies were resolved by discussion between the two coders.  <<Insert Table 3>> Findings External Stakeholders National Government The prime source of the government’s power comes from its resource power, and its degree of centrality (number of links to other stakeholders). Whilst the government does not necessarily possess resources required by franchise chains, it does possess the capacity to remove critical resource (through fines) from franchise chains who do not comply with its regulatory requirements. The government can use coercive authority to ensure that organizations act in the manner they wish. However, whilst the introduction of the law in 2016 for waste sorting suggests the use of coercive authority, the absence of sanctions on those chains who are not compliant, suggests the French government is reluctant to wield this form of power. It was not until 2019 that the fast food operators were confronted, and despite a lack of compliance for three years, chains have been granted further time to introduce appropriate waste management practices before they will be penalized. It would seem, however, that the threat of the use of coercive authority has sharpened the focus of franchisors who now see this as an imperative.  The French government has also used its position in the network to exert pressure on the franchisor through other stakeholder groups, most notably consumers by publicising the shortcomings of major fast food chains in national media, even naming the non-compliant chains. One franchisor commented: “…I think she's [Brune Poirson] putting pressure on us, not necessarily with sanctions but rather with the media in fact” (#10). This ‘naming and shaming’ of franchise chains within the media is a form of persuasive power.  Local Government Whilst the national government has imposed requirements for fast food chains to introduce green waste management practices, our findings suggest that local government also has the power to help ensure fast food chains implement better practices. Local government’s key source of power relates to the infrastructure resources and facilities they possess for waste collection and disposal. Whilst some local municipalities have invested heavily in waste collection services, in others the provision is seen by franchisors as substantially lacking. In particular, frequency of collection over busy periods like weekends means that outlets face difficulty in storing waste. For example: “[City name] has commissioned a truck that goes from Tuesday to Friday. They stay there for half an hour, and we have to put out all the rubbish and all the boxes. The problem is that we're open 7 days a week, every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, which are our busiest days, which makes it a bit complicated because we end up with all our waste” (#17). The amount of sorting supported also varies, with some municipalities supporting five stream sorting, and others only offering two or three stream sorting. Some respondents explained that sorting at their restaurant was futile, as everything is placed in a single bin by the municipal collection services. A franchisor said: “…we can sort it out on our side, and at the end, they take all the bags, they put them in the same bin…there's no logic at all. What's the point?” (#4). This perception of variability in local authority commitment to waste management is supported by statistics, with recycling rates of solid waste varying between 28% and 55% across different regions of France (European Environment Agency, 2016), perhaps reflecting differences in budget allocation for waste management, as well as differences in how national policies have been applied. Local authorities can thus be seen as possessing inducement authority with respect to the franchise chains – the provision of waste collection and disposal services by local authorities facilitates the adoption of green waste management practices by franchise chains. In some cases, local authorities also use coercive authority to help promote sorting practices by imposing fines on restaurants which do not comply with local regulations. Customers The customers of the fast food chains were found to be powerful stakeholders. The customers’ source of power comes from the resources they possess: financial and human capital. Customers have the power to withdraw their custom from chains who do not meet their expectations of appropriate waste management practice (coercive power). Thus, for some chains, customers were a strong driving force behind decisions to change waste management practices, due to their increasing green expectations. As one franchisor commented: “I think it's the consumer behavior that impacts businesses […] I think it's not necessarily because a restaurant is going to start sorting that customers are going to start sorting. I think it's because consumers are going to start wanting to sort that restaurants in general are going to do the same...” (#18).Even in the context of government regulation and potential sanctions, it is the economic power of the customers that appears to motivate changes in practice. However, several systems are not convinced that the environmental performance of the chain is important to consumers patronage decisions. A franchisor remarked: “I don't know if we gain customers because we recycle. I don't know if we can lose customers because we don't recycle… it's true that it's possible, but I don't know…” (#19).  For those systems which are wishing to change their practices in order to comply with government regulation, consumers were felt to be an impediment to compliance. Consumers hold an important resource – human capital – that franchise chains are dependent upon for the successful implementation of waste sorting. As one franchisor commented: “…they put everything in the same bin. That's what's quite surprising because today's consumers are extremely demanding when it comes to brands in terms of their environmental commitments. But in their consumption habits, they don't sort waste. A few do, but the vast majority, over 90%, do not do so…” (#3). The lack of cooperation of customers was certainly felt to inhibit the chains ability to comply with regulation. One franchisor said: “We want to do well, we want it to work, we want to sort but it's not necessarily the case for the customer […] It's not a question of putting a trash in the garbage and saying that is ‘sorting’! That's not how it works…” (#10). Franchisors seem to lack legitimate authority over their customers, and therefore simply obliging consumers to participate in sorting of their waste within the restaurant, is not sufficient to induce the desired behavior. Whilst some chains feel that consumers have little concern about environmental issues, and impede their ability to comply with regulations, other chains believe consumers are concerned with the brand environmental performance. Unsurprisingly, those chains who feel their consumers are influenced by environmental factors are the most proactive in improving their waste management practices.  Suppliers Our findings showed that suppliers have the power to facilitate or inhibit the implementation of green waste practices in fast food restaurants. Primarily this is because some suppliers have valuable resources in the form of knowledge and facilities which can be used to help improve waste management. Suppliers were able to assist franchisors in the implementation of green waste practices in several ways. Firstly, many franchisors were able to work with their suppliers in the development of more ecological materials (e.g., organic cutlery, or recyclable packaging). Suppliers seem to be more advanced than the franchise chains in the development of more ecological materials, making suggestions to the chains as to how they can improve their practices. One franchisor said “We work with [Name of the supplier] who provides us with … all of our packaging […] They're the ones who first suggested we use paper straws” (#5).   Secondly, suppliers play an important role in waste recovery. A franchisor explained: “… Our logistics provider comes each week to deliver one to four pallets of dry or cold products. …When they make the delivery, they take the cardboard boxes and plastic waste which we generated during the week; and then we enter into a much more virtuous circle, a much better win-win situation” (#3).  Many franchise chains have developed partnerships to reduce and recover waste. Some chains work with a social enterprise to recover their food waste, with unsold items sold at a lower price through an online platform. Other partnerships concern organic waste, coffee grounds, oils. For example, one franchisor said: “We have a partner who retrieves all our organic waste to make fertilizers for agriculture around Paris. […] We also have [another partner] […] and in fact it's a company that grows mushrooms and retrieves our coffee grounds […] They reclaim our coffee grounds to make fertilizers for their mushrooms. So in fact it revalorizes our waste […] 90% of our organic waste is coffee, so it's huge!” (#18). As new and existing suppliers have developed ecological initiatives to help improve waste practices, this has persuaded franchisors to adopt better practices. In this regard, suppliers use authority power, in the form of competence (expert) authority to influence franchise chains’ waste practices. Many suppliers seem to have reacted to the changes mandated by government more rapidly, developing new materials to protect their business in the long run, and identifying new market opportunities in offering waste solutions.   Whilst generally suppliers seemed to be enabling franchise fast food chains to develop greener waste management practices and comply with regulation, a few franchisors had experienced difficulties with their suppliers. As one franchisor explained: “We have a lot of trouble because our suppliers give us wooden crates for the vegetables, and we can't put the wood in any garbage cans” (#17). However, franchisors have the power to delist suppliers (coercive authority) who do not offer packaging or materials that meet their requirements. Overall we find that suppliers, through their competence authority, have created improvements in the waste management practices of the fast food sector. Internal Stakeholders Franchisees According to the literature, both internal and external stakeholders play a role in the development and implementation of green practices (Lin et al., 2019). For franchise systems, they have an additional, and potentially powerful stakeholder - their franchisees. Whilst a franchisor is usually considered the more powerful partner in the franchisor-franchisee relationship, we found that franchisees are not without power when it comes to the successful implementation of waste management practices. Similar to consumers, franchisees’ power is derived from both their resources (particularly human capital) and network position (proximity to final consumer).  For many chains, franchisees are required to follow the waste management practices stipulated by the franchisor (in the same way they are required to follow all operational processes stipulated by the franchisor). Although the franchisor has the potential to use legitimate or coercive authority to influence franchisee behavior, the extent to which franchisees adhere to, or are required to adhere to, franchisor instructions with respect to waste practices varies. One franchisor commented that franchisees are given a certain amount of latitude, stating that: “…the franchisees are independent, so we strongly advise them but we can't force them, so they are free. Now, in our own stores [company-owned stores], we don't leave them any choice” (#11). For other systems, waste practices are mandated, and checks are made to ensure compliance. As one franchisor stated: “The franchisees are bound by the franchise contract […]. It will become an obligation […] and there will be repercussions if they don’t” (#14). Of course, whilst franchisors can make checks that franchisees are following instructions, and potentially impose sanctions if they do not (use coercive authority), ultimately franchisees have considerable operational power with respect to sorting. The franchisees network position affords them power to impede the franchisor’s ability to comply with the regulations.  The variability of local municipalities in the provision of services they offered, also creates additional challenges for franchisors to establish chain-wide sorting practices that can be mandated, as they have to tailor the processes for franchisees located in different territories. For other aspects of waste management, such as the use of packaging materials, franchisors have greater sway (coercive authority), given they control the supplies. As one franchisor commented: “they [franchisees] are dependent on the packaging we offer as they are not able to buy packaging anywhere else” (#13).In this regard, the resources of the franchisor can be used to afford coercive authority over their franchisees. Although, the franchisor-franchisee relationship is usually characterized as one where the franchisor has greater power, it is not subject to the same types of hierarchical controls typical in employer-employee relationships (Combs et al., 2004), and this means that some franchisors do not feel they have the power to introduce changes without consultation, or at least are more reluctant to introduce changes without considering the potential impacts on franchisees. In such cases, franchisees themselves have some legitimate authority, primarily obtained from their position within the network. As one franchisor commented: “…negotiation is important.” (#13). Several franchisors stressed how they had to explain the need for change to their franchisees, for example: “…our approach is to try to explain on the one hand that in terms of brand image for a network, continuing to make 100% plastic … is in the long run quite suicidal. What we are advocating to them is that integrating an environmental approach to packaging is a question of survival for restaurant groups.” (#13).In this regard, franchisors use competence authority to influence their franchisees’ behavior. Such an approach may be preferred over coercive methods to ensure maintenance of good franchisee-franchisor relationships. Whilst the need to consult with franchisees about proposed changes does potentially slow some franchisors implementation of green waste management practices, for other systems, franchisees were driving the changes, encouraging the franchisor to adopt greener practices, and proposing potential initiatives or solutions. As one franchisor explained: “sometimes there are franchisees who have good ideas, good practices and we will take this information to the company-owned stores, and listen to the franchisees” (#14). In this regard, it was the legitimate authority of the franchisees which led to changes in waste management practices. Franchisees’ key source of power is their betweenness with respect to different stakeholder groups; their position in the network means they, unlike the franchisor, have direct interactions with both employees and customers. Several franchisors commented on their reliance on franchisees to train and motivate employees appropriately, as well as educate consumers. Of course, this means that franchisors are relying on franchisees to be motivated and provide their human capital to support effective implementation of green waste management practices. A franchisor said: “… they have to be motivated on their own because otherwise a manager who is not motivated can't pass on the motivation of sorting to his/her teams and show them that it's not that complicated” (#18). Motivation withstanding, some franchisors felt that because they are reliant on franchisees to convey information to employees, that employee training will not be as effective. As a franchisor stated: “We're going to teach the franchisee who will then teach the employee and the manager. So, at the end of the day, there is always a loss of information…” (#5).  In addition to their legitimate authority over employee behavior, franchisees were also seen to be in a position of power when it came to educating consumers. As a franchisor commented “…it's up to them [each franchisee] to put in place, at least at the customer level, a member of staff who can explain to customers how to sort, which bin to put it in and how to do that for sure” (#6). Thus, franchisees have persuasive power with respect to consumers, afforded to them by their network position. Restaurant Employees Just as franchisees have power as a result of their position in the network, employees too have power afforded to them because of their betweenness and can use coercive power to withhold their human capital that is required to implement green waste management practices as set out by the franchisor. Whilst employees are generally believed to follow procedures, some franchisors mentioned that this is not always the case. Franchisors are reliant on franchisees to train and enforce appropriate behaviors among their employees, and thus franchisors have no direct legitimate or coercive authority over employees in franchised outlets. Further evidence of the power afforded to employees, through their network position, was found in the relationship with the chain’s customers. Since employees are the ones who directly interact with consumers, it provides them with persuasive power in their relations with consumers. As one franchisor commented: “…they [employees] have an educational role vis-à-vis the customers. Today as a small business and a restaurant, you are the leader of your customers, it is up to you to demonstrate that the implementation of sorting is important. So, we are going to ask you to be an educator…” (#1). However, because it is the franchisees who are responsible for managing employees, ultimately the franchisor has only an indirect relationship with employees, which leaves them with little ability to control their behaviors with respect to this important informational role. In other words, the franchisor lacks coercive or legitimate authority with respect to employees in franchise outlets. Although employees do appear to have power to influence the implementation of green waste practices, they did not appear to have power to influence the development of the waste management strategy. The power employees hold with respect to implementation, comes from the relationship with the customer, rather than their interactions with the franchisor. Discussion Whilst the important role stakeholders play in the development of green strategies has been highlighted by several studies (Baah et al., 2020; Harness et al., 2018; Lin et al.2018; Prud’homme and Raymond, 2016; Theodoulidis et al., 2017), little attention has been given to how stakeholders influence the implementation of environmental practices mandated by government through regulation. Although it might be expected that regulatory powers bestow governments with the greater power compared with other stakeholders, our findings suggest that the presence of regulation is not in itself sufficient to induce change without the co-operation of several stakeholders.We find that for franchise chains, the stakeholder with the greatest power is the franchisee. Indeed, their network position – their betweenness – provides them with substantive persuasive power, and coercive and legitimate authority in relation to employees and customers. Their network position also fundamentally alters the ability of franchisors to directly engage in dialog, consult with, and educate these two key stakeholders. Thus, whilst franchisors can potentially mandate franchisees to comply with the operational processes they develop, they are reliant on their franchisees’ motivation and co-operation in engaging other stakeholders, most notably the customer, to ensure a mutuality of sustainability interests and knowledge and skills development. For example, customers, must follow waste sorting instructions, and thus, franchisees and their employees have an important role to play in educating them (ensuring customers have the knowledge of how to sort) and convincing them of the benefits of co-operation (mutuality of interests). Thus, for implementation to be successful, franchisees are required to do more than simply follow processes mandated by franchisors but be proactive in their engagement with those stakeholders with whom they have regular interactions. In this respect, franchisors cannot rely on coercive authority to force franchisees to cooperate – such an approach is only likely to have sway in relation to operational aspects. Rather they should use persuasion, competence and legitimate authority, in order to motivate franchisees, and convince them of the potential benefits of improved environmental practices for their business.  As with other types of organization, consumers were found to be a highly influential stakeholder group. Many franchisors do not believe that the environmental performance of fast food chains is important in most consumers’ decision-making. In the absence of consumers using their persuasive power or coercive authority to influence franchisors (or indeed franchisees) to improve their waste management practices, many franchisors do not view compliance with regulations as an urgent issue. The franchisor’s detachment from their customers means they are heavily reliant on their franchisees for customer insights and engagement, given it is they who sit at the coalface of customer centric activities (Watson et al., 2020), making it more challenging for franchisors to understand how to approach and implement sustainable practices. Whilst most franchisors believe that the majority of consumers are not significantly motivated by environmental issues, of course for some consumers this a concern. Chains that target environmentally concerned consumers were found to be (or at least claimed to be) compliant with the regulations. This highlights the important role of consumers in changing organizational practices.  Our findings thus show that the possession of various forms and bases of power by different stakeholder groups has important implications for the implementation of green management practices, even those required by law. Figure 1 illustrates the network of inter-stakeholder power relationships and the central position of franchisees. It highlights how the existence of different bases and forms of power create a complex web of often opposing forces. Whilst franchisors have coercive power over their franchisees, franchisees have substantive legitimate and competence authority (due to their local market knowledge) over their franchisors. Franchisees have persuasive power over their customers; yet customers have coercive authority as they may boycott restaurants, and can refuse to co-operate with waste sorting.  This intertwining of power, along with the reciprocity, make the implementation of green practices within franchised fast food chains, even those that are regulated, highly challenging. <<Insert Figure 1>> Contributions to the Literature Our research contributes to the literature on green practices and franchising in several ways. Firstly, we enrich the stream of literature on green practices in the tourism and hospitality sector (Kim et al., 2017) by examining the question of stakeholder power in the specific case of the restaurant sector that has been neglected in the literature compared to the hotel sector (Chan and Hsu, 2016). Moreover, the number of studies which include franchise organizations in exploring green practices is scant (Kim and Lee, 2020). Secondly, whilst within the franchising literature, a few studies have explored CSR (Choi and Lee, 2018; Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Meiseberg and Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015), these have not focused on environmental practices in particular, nor the role of different stakeholder groups in their implementation. The presence of franchisees can slow implementation, as franchisors must persuade franchisees of the potential benefits to their business of any changes in practice in order to maintain positive franchisee-franchisor relationships, and ensure their co-operation in educating and training employees and customers in new green practices.  Thirdly, we contribute to stakeholder theory by focusing on how stakeholder power contributes to the implementation of green practices. Our study is one of the first studies to consider how organizations respond to regulatory changes, unlike the extant literature where the focus has been on voluntary actions.This study therefore broadens and deepens our understanding of the role of different stakeholders in ensuring that regulations are effective in changing organizational practice. Moreover, whilst power has long been recognized as determining the salience of different stakeholders to environmental strategy development (Harvey and Schaefer, 2001; Rivera-Camino, 2007), its role in the implementation phase is less researched. However, as Lin et al. (2017, p. 319) comment, “understanding the distribution of stakeholder power is important for the clarification of different roles and responsibilities on implementing social responsibility”. We consider both the bases and form of power that different stakeholders possess, extending previous studies which have focused on either the source (Hazra et al., 2017; Pajunen, 2006; Tiew et al., 2015) or form (Beritelli and Laesser, 2011; Marzano and Scott, 2009; Saito and Ruhanen, 2017) of power. Contributions to Practice Our research also contributes to practice and policy. For franchisors, our findings may help them to better understand the role of different stakeholders in achieving improved green practices. Given the powerful role of franchisees in ensuring successful implementation, franchisors should consider carefully how they communicate changes within the system to ensure that franchisees not only adopt the necessary processes, but are motivated to promote these changes to their employees and consumers, and recruit employees who are environmentally sensitive. Using coercive power alone over franchisees is unlikely to be successful – rather they have to use their legitimate and competence authority to persuade franchisees of the benefits of their involvement. Franchisors can codify their know-how on waste management practices in their operational manuals, and transfer this set of know-how to their franchisees through initial and continuous training sessions, including webinars on their Intranet system for franchisees’ employees as well. Knowledge-sharing structures which encourage social exchanges (such as Franchisee Advisory Councils) and regional and national meetings could be used to promote social capital (Watson et al., 2020), given its importance in mobilizing stakeholder engagement in sustainability activities (Maak, 2007). For governments, we highlight that without co-operation of several stakeholder groups, their coercive power may not be sufficient to ensure effective regulation. Regulators need to consider how different stakeholder groups will respond to any proposed changes, and how other forms of power, for example persuasive power, can be used over different stakeholder groups to ensure organizations are motivated and able to respond to changes in legislation. Approaches which seek to align the interests and values of stakeholders, and provide incentives for stakeholders to cooperate on advancing sustainable practices may be more fruitful in comparison with coercive approaches alone (Hörisch et al., 2014).  Limitations and Directions for Future Research Our research is not without limitations. Firstly, the qualitative approach based on a series of 19 in-depth interviews with franchisors and senior head office staff limits our ability to generalize our findings. Whilst a qualitative approach was deemed appropriate in understanding the power of stakeholders, as it enables an understanding of behavior to be developed “from the point of view of those being studied” (Bryman, 1988, p. 46), we need to be cautious in generalizing to other contexts. A quantitative study could help overcome limitations of generalizability, and be used to assess franchisor perceptions of stakeholder power (persuasion, and coercive, legitimate and competent authority) and engagement to determine their influence in the implementation process. Secondly, our study only considers the views of franchisors and their head office staff. Whilst we believe their perceptions are critical in understanding the implementation process, particularly in a context where changes have been mandated through regulation, it could be interesting in future research to explore the perceptions of other stakeholders, e.g., franchisees, franchisee employees and customers to determine how well franchisors truly understand the issues. Such an approach could enable more practical insights for franchisors. Thirdly, our study deals with the French market only. Given that all European member states are subject to the EU Waste Framework Directive, it could be of interest to conduct a multi-country study within Europe in order to explore the potential effects of cultural or institutional factors. Fourthly, another direction for future research could consist of studying the green practices of chains that operate internationally to determine if/how differences in stakeholder influences in different markets affect implementation in those markets.  Due to the need for ever greener practices not just in the fast food sector but other sectors where franchising is prevalent, we hope our findings will encourage further research on green practices in franchise chains given the particular challenges franchisees infer. \n",

THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING  IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY Manuel González Díaz  University of Oviedo Oviedo, 33006 SPAIN Email : mgdiaz@uniovi.es  Marta Fernández-Barcala  University of Oviedo Oviedo, 33006 SPAIN Email : mbarcala@uniovi.esSusana López-Bayón  University of Oviedo Oviedo, 33006 SPAIN Email : sbayon@uniovi.es Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School UNSW Business School May 24-26, 2021 TO DO OR TO TEACH? THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING  IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY ABSTRACT Although franchise and management contracts constitute the dominant way of organizing business-to-business relationships within hotel chains, no study has compared their relative performance. This paper aims to explain their differences and assess their impact on online scores, currently a key performance indicator in the hotel industry. We argue that franchises are less effective than management contracts for operating upscale hotels due to the relative advantages that the latter have in transferring and enforcing tacit knowledge, typically embedded in skilled staff and very relevant in such quality-tier hotels. Conversely, franchising is better for large hotels because, first, its incentive structure better addresses managerial shirking (typically more severe as hotel size increases) and, second, it offers advantages when the normalization of business procedures is key to success (as is true for large establishments). Our empirical findings broadly support these arguments in a dataset of 220 Spanish hotel groups, also providing evidence that no single organizational solution fits all situations.Key words: Franchising, management contract, hotel industry, knowledge, online scores TO DO OR TO TEACH? THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS. FRANCHISING IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY INTRODUCTION As with the tourism industry, the hotel sector has grown significantly in recent decades. For instance, international tourist arrivals worldwide more than doubled during the 21 century. This growth has facilitated hotel firm specialization, driving companies to focus on fewer stages of the supply chain (Stigler, 1951). A clear example of this specialization is the move by the world's leading hotel groups to divest properties (i.e., real estate business) and specialize in hotel operations and brand management (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). This growth has resulted in the so-called asset-light and fee-oriented (ALFO) strategy (Li and Singal, 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014), which is strongly based on the development of effective business-to-business relationships between hoteliers. Starting years ago with US market leaders such as Marriot and Hilton, the ALFO strategy is currently a dominant trend in the industry (Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017; Mercier, 2020) and consists of growing by developing brands and business concepts and then incorporating affiliated hotels that pay a fee for their use. However, this affiliation means that several independent firms must cooperate by contributing those assets necessary to offer a full lodging service. The choice of how to implement this cooperation between firms is key to success according to the interorganizational relationship literature (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Williamson, 1991).  International tourist arrivals rose worldwide from 686 million in 2000 to 1.461 million in 2019, according to World Tourism Organization (available at: https://webunwto.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2020-01/Barometro-Jan-2020-EN-pre.pdf). We have not taken into account the year 2020 to avoid the COVID-19 pandemic effect which is not relevant in our analysis. Several papers have analyzed the influence on different performance measures of, first, the decision to affiliate with a brand or to remain unaffiliated (e.g., Carvell et al., 2016) and then the affiliation choice (e.g., Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosová et al., 2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Madanoglu and Karadag, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, these studies are substantially biased towards the analysis of franchised vs. owned establishments, probably because of the economic relevance of franchising in retailing and the interest arising from franchise contracts among academics (e.g.,Combs, Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2004; Dant and Kaufmann, 2003; Lafontaine, 1992; Williamson 1991). Furthermore, these studies are not conclusive. While some authors conclude that differences in the relative performance of governance forms are not systematic (e.g., Carvell et al., 2016; Kosová et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Vázquez, Mejía and Sánchez, 2020), others find significant impacts on various key performance indicators (KPIs), such as prices, occupancy rates, or profitability (e.g., Kalnins, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014). In addition to franchising, the hotel industry has adopted another organizational form that underpins the ALFO strategy: management contracts (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988). In the management contract, a hotel group that owns a well-known brand (and the related key assets such as know-how and a reservation system) agrees to use its assets in a hotel (owned by a local partner), assuming, unlike in a franchise agreement, the management of this property directly in exchange for a share of the revenues (base fee) and profits (incentive fee). In franchising, the hotel group (franchisor) standardizes the business format and creates a franchise package to transmit the know-how that enables the local partner (franchisee) to replicate the business concept successfully and run it almost independently in exchange for a franchise fee (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). Conversely, in the management contract, the hotel group (the management company) does not so explicitly transfer its know-how because its personnel run the property directly (Ferrary, 2015). In other words, the hotel group must “teach to manage” in franchising, while it must “manage” the property itself in a management contract. We argue that the difference between “doing” and “teaching to do” is not trivial for hotel management. Surprisingly, despite the relevance of management and franchise contracts in the hotel industry—the European average for management contracts and franchises in major hotel groups is 21% and 50%, and in the US, it is 13% and 85%, respectively (Collins and Perret, 2015)—little research has been done on their differences. Different comparisons have been made, but not between these two forms. Some authors group them into a single category, the ALFO strategy, to compare them with ownership and/or rental (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, Izadi, and Olya, 2020; Hua, DeFranco and Abbot, 2020; Fernández, González and López, 2021; Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019; Soh, Tan and Jang, 2013; 2014). Others, more numerous, seek to compare franchising with other organizational forms, ignoring management contracts (e.g.,Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015) or grouping them with company-owned establishments in a category called company-operated or company-managed hotels (e.g., Kosová, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Kosová and Sertsios, 2018, Kalnins, 2017, Zhang et al., 2015). The literature analyzing international hotel group expansion takes organizational forms as separate categories and highlights their differences (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018), but they do not analyze the effect on performance, instead examining the probability of choosing one form depending on host country characteristics and other contextual factors. This paper aims to compare the performance of franchising and management contracts, studying whether there are systematic differences in the characteristics of the hotels in which one formula outperforms another. Thus, we assume that no contract solution systematically outperforms the other, nor does it always produce better results. In this regard, we hypothesize that the franchise and management contracts differ in asset allocation and control, yielding two effects. The first effect is related to how the managed/franchisee firms access the knowledge needed to run the hotel according to brand standards and routings (i.e., knowledge transfer problem). The second effect is linked to the capacity of both types of contracts to prevent misbehavior and managerial shirking at the local level. We maintain that management contracts outperform franchising for transferring tacit knowledge because “doing” works better than “teaching to do”, especially when tacit know-how is relevant. Conversely, franchising outperforms management contracts when shirking and the need for standardization are significant issues. Our performance variable is online scores, a KPI in the hotel industry (e.g., Kwok et al2017; Sainaghi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). This study makes two contributions to the hospitality literature. First, we focus our comparison only on those organizational forms that represent the real choice of hotel groups (franchising vs. management contracts) given the predominance of the ALFO strategy. To date, the typical comparison in the literature on interorganizational relations and organizational economics (., Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosová, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Michael, 2000 and 2002) has been based on aggregations that, although correct from a theoretical standpoint, do not truly reflect the options that hotel groups actually consider in their expansion decisions. Furthermore, this fine-grained analysis avoids the problem of grouping substantially different organizational forms in a single category that can bias the results. Second, we contribute to the literature on organizational fit in the hotel industry because our results show that management contracts fit better in upscale hotels, where the business requires more tacit knowledge, suggesting that the transmission of know-how is more effective within the organization than between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al. 2008; Kogut and Zander, 1993; Shaw and Williams, 2009). This highlights a franchise weakness: the transfer of this type of knowledge when it is key for success (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). Similarly, we show that franchising moderates the negative effect of size on performance (Kosová and Sertsios, 2018). This suggests that its higher standardization capabilities, combined with its higher-powered incentives, make the franchise a better organizational form than management contracts in large hotels. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Franchise and management contracts stand out as prevalent business-to-business governance solutions used by large hotel groups to achieve rapid expansion in the industry (Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017; Collins and Perret, 2015; 2019; Mercier, 2020). Both types of contracts have significant similarities that have led them to be jointly analyzed in the hospitality literature. In a franchise agreement, the franchisor (brand owner) owns a business concept and grants the right to operate it to the franchisee (hotel owner) for a term in exchange for a franchise fee (Brickley and Dark 1987; Rubin, 1978). In a management contract, the hotel owner (managed company) hires a management company as an agent to operate the hotel business on its behalf in exchange for a management fee (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988). A key common feature of these two types of contracts is that the ownership of the business format (held by a hotel group) is separate from the hotel ownership/property (held by the franchisee/managed firm) (Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Melissen, van Ginneken, and Wood, 2016). Therefore, both partners must ally to use their co-specialized resources and provide the service. One partner (i.e.,the franchisor/management company) provides the brand name and the method of doing business according to a proven business system. The other partner (i.e., franchisee/managed firm) contributes all local physical assets (facilities, furniture, fixtures, and equipment) and is entitled to the hotel’s residual income. Thus, in the transaction cost economics literature (Williamson, 1991), both franchise and management agreements generate a hybrid form of governance that contrasts with independent or chain-owned hotels (where hotel proprietors operate under their own brand). This shared feature has led franchise and management contracts to be considered equally valuable instruments for hotel groups' adoption of the so-called ALFO strategy. This strategy involves reducing the real estate ownership at stake and basing revenue generation on fees charged to owners of the property (Li and Singal 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014). Through franchise and management contracts, hotel groups can grow and leverage their intangible strategic assets (e.g., brand equity, business know-how, and reservation systems) without making large capital investments while basing their revenues on the collection of franchise and management feesAmong the main advantages attributed to the ALFO strategy, the hotel literature has highlighted its ability to reduce financial risks for hotel chains (Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014) and to expand the hotel business, efficiently leveraging intangible assets and avoiding huge capital investments (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002). However, although recent research does seem to confirm the risk advantages of this strategy (e.g., Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013; 2014), the evidence for its ability to improve hotel chains' performance, as measured by different financial ratios, is inconclusive. Whereas some studies suggest positive impacts on performance  The franchise fee follows a nonlinear payment schedule, with a fixed initial fee plus variable continuing fees (e.g., royalty fee, advertising or marketing fee, reservation fee, loyalty fee). The continuing fees can be tied to the gross revenue or the number of rooms (Collins and Perret, 2019; Mathewson and Winter, 1985). By contrast, the management fee is composed of a base fee and an incentive fee. The base fee can be a fixed sum or a percent of revenues/profits. The incentive fee depends on the achievement of a certain predefined profit level and is usually linked to the gross operating profit (for the operator to monitor the hotel’s operating costs). Thus, the incentive fee implies a risk-sharing arrangement with the management company (Hua, DeFranco, and Abbott, 2020). e.g., Sohn et al., 2013; Seo and Soh, 2019; Hua, DeFranco, and Abbot, 2020), others find only negligible differences (Bourke, Izadi, and Olia, 2020) or no difference in performance between asset-light and asset-based (i.e., with significant ownership or leased property stakes) hotel groups. ALFO also introduces other problems. According to agency theory arguments (Eisenhardt, 1989), the separation of hotel (i.e., real state) ownership from its strategic intangible assets (i.e.brand name and know-how) may also lead to significant conflicts of interest, with negative consequences for the hotel group and its brand equity (Brickley and Dark, 1987; Rivas, et al.2013; Rubin, 1978). On the one hand, the franchisee and the managed company as residual claimants of their establishments directly receive the result of their management efforts, which usually makes them well-motivated local hoteliers compared to hired managers of company-owned hotels (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017). However, the transfer of ownership that accompanies an ALFO strategy also implies the loss of control over hotel properties by the brand, which may undermine its ability to ensure compliance with its standards and lead to serious inconsistencies in quality and operations within the chain e.g., Brookes, Altinay and Aktas, 2015; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018; Michael, 2000, 2002; Sun, Park and He, 2019). Ultimately, this could result in worse service and lower customer satisfaction in franchise and managed hotels, challenging brand performance in the medium and long term. Comparative effectiveness of franchising vs. management contracts in ALFO strategies The success of the ALFO strategy as a preferred form of expansion may lead to the mistaken assumption that it fits, in terms of performance, all organizations in the hospitality industry (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). However, its effectiveness also depends on  (governance form) and where (contextual factors) it is applied. In this regard, recent studies highlight that its benefits/drawbacks may not necessarily be uniform across companies or even over time (Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019; Sohn et al., 2014). Moreover, the effectiveness of the ALFO strategy may also depend on the contractual forms that support it, i.e.,franchise vs. management contracts. On this point, the interorganizational literature proposes that there is no universally superior organizational form (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Wiliamson, 1991). Rather, the distinctive characteristics of each organizational form make them better suited to respond to particular problems. However, most studies have overlooked the comparative analysis of franchise vs. management contracts and their differential effects on hotel performance (Kruesi et al., 2018). In fact, extant research on the impact of ALFO strategies on firms’ performance has ignored this issue, regarding both types of contract as a single or equivalent governance form (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, et al., 2020; Hua, et al., 2020; Seo and Soh, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013). Therefore, a closer examination of the differences between these alternative models is necessary. Despite their similarities, franchise and management contracts have meaningful differences in their governance structure that can alter the type and severity of conflicts between brands and proprietors and, thus, the performance of hotel firms. Contractor and Kundu (1998) recognize that the main differencelies in the degree of control over strategic business assets (e.g., brand name, global reservation system, and business know-how embedded in routines and daily operations). This is because in a management contract, the hotel group retains the responsibility for directing and managing the establishment's operations. That is, the hotel group appoints one general manager to run the local hotel directly, usually in collaboration with other local managers who are hired by the managed company (Brooks and Roper, 2010; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Kruesi et al., 2018; Melissen et al., 2016). Consequently, the owner of the strategic intangible business assets (the hotel group) has a substantial influence on most of the daily decisions of the local hotel, affecting its value. In contrast, under a franchise contract, the franchisor firm has less control over the intangible assets because it has delegated day-to-day management of such assets to the franchisee, and no franchisor representative is present daily at the local level. Clearly, the franchisees must abide by the contract and the operations manual, but they independently interpret how to operate the hotel establishment. Another key distinguishing feature is that the management contract entails the clearest separation between the operation of the hotel and its ownershipi.e., ownership over real estate and residual income) (Melissen et al., 2016). In franchised hotels, the person who operates the establishment (franchisee) also receives the residual income from the business; however, in managed hotels, the operator (management company) is not the residual claimant. These differences in terms of asset allocation and control can alter the ability to transfer knowledge and prevent opportunistic behavior within the hotel group. In this regard, we propose that no contractual solution is always superior, but its effectiveness will depend on the particular context in which it applies. Distinctive characteristics of the service provision will determine the knowledge transfer requirements and main agency problems supported by a hotel and, thus, the governance form best suited to respond to them. In hypothesis form:H1. The impact of governance form (franchise vs. management contract) on hotel performance is not direct but contingent on hotel characteristics. Management contract advantages in (tacit) knowledge transfer Unlike management contracts, franchising requires the franchisor to transfer business knowledge to franchisees because they are independently running the property and need to learn how to do so. This means that it is necessary to transfer knowledge between independent companies. Conversely, management contracts do not require any explicit transfer of knowledge because the general manager who operates the establishment and oversees the application of such know-how has already acquired it (i.e., they are employees of the management company). Consequently, here, the transfer of knowledge is within the management company and among its employees (Ferrary, 2015). In this regard, the organizational literature argues that the transfer of knowledge within an organization is less challenging than that between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al., 2008; Kogut and Zander, 1992; Shaw and Williams, 2009), meaning that management contracts hold a potential advantage. In the franchise context, the franchisor has the legal obligation to transfer its know-how to the franchisee, since it is assumed that such proprietary and distinctive knowledge is essential for the success of the franchise business. Furthermore, such knowledge is articulated into business practicese.g., Combs and Ketchen, 1999; Barthélemy, 2008) that are subsequently conveyed to the franchisee through contracts, operation manuals, initial training, and day-to-day assistance (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). This set of codified knowledge (i.e., franchise manuals and contracts) constitutes the franchisors’ main repository of knowledge (Solís and González, 2019). Conversely, in the management contract, the management company specializes in supplying its employees to the affiliated hotels. It focuses on recruiting, training, and managing qualified staff i.e., general managers and experts responsible for specialized departments) and then assigning them to the group’s establishments. The managed firm (i.e., hotel owner) hires the remaining line workers and deals with the real estate aspects of the business (Ferrary, 2015). Therefore, the main repository of knowledge is not the manuals, as in franchising, but the skilled staff of the hotel group, so the strategic know-how needed to operate the business remains in-houseFurthermore, compared to the knowledge acquired by independent franchisees, managerial know-how in management contracts is more likely to be of a tacit (non-codifiable) nature because knowledge acquisition is based on internal training, internships, and daily experiences within the hotel group. Internal knowledge transfer facilitates the informal links, communication, and learning by doing that are needed to develop and absorb tacit knowledge (Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). Because tacit knowledge cannot be fully articulated in electronic databases or manuals, passing on tacit business practices to independent franchisees can becomeimprecise or too expensive (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2004; Paswan and Wittman, 2009). In sum, when hotel groups need to transfer highly tacit business know-how, they should benefit more from management contracts. The category of the hotel might determine the tacitness of the knowledge to be transferred. Upscale and luxury hotels are knowledge-intensive companies, and most of this know-how is more complex and difficult to codify (tacit) than that of lower-category hotels (Ferrary, 2015; León et al., 2011). Upscale hotels are also more difficult to monitor than lower-category hotels because it is very costly to detail ex-ante the attributes and procedures for delivering high-value service and, thus, establish reasonable standards to evaluate them. In this regard, Ehbauer and Gresel (2013) highlight how luxury retail still lacks adequate management tools because of the difficulty in designing qualitative and quantitative KPIs to ensure effective management in upscale stores. Therefore, in upscale or luxury hotels, which require the transfer of more tacit knowledge, the typical knowledge transfer between companies that the franchise entails and its subsequent articulation in manuals or documents is less effective than the transfer of knowledge within the company (i.e., based on the employees) typical of management contracts. In other words, “doing it” is easier than “teaching how to do it”. This difficulty may result in the inability to ensure adequate compliance with brand quality standards in high-end franchised hotels, ultimately resulting in poorer service and lower customer satisfaction (i.e., lower online scores) for franchised hotels than for managed hotels. Thus: H2. The interaction of franchise ( management) contracts and hotel category has a negative effect on online scores. Franchising advantages in preventing shirking and fostering standardization The governance differences between management contracts and franchising may also affect the severity of the different types of opportunism that may occur at the establishment level. First, in any network of geographically dispersed establishments, it is necessary to prevent shirking in the effort of the local manager (Rubin, 1978). Both contract forms provide a helpful tool to reduce this problem because managed firms and franchisees both bear the economic and financial risks of their actions because they are the residual claimants on the hotel’s profits. However, management contracts likely offer a weaker solution to this problem than franchising. Unlike franchisees, the general managers of managed hotels have no residual claim on the profits of the establishments because they are employees of the management company. This condition provides them with less powerful incentives to perform (e.g., to closely supervise hotel personnel and operations) (Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017). Management companies monitor their behavior and can introduce incentive systems that better align interests, such as performance-based variable pay (e.g., executive bonus plans), which links managers’ compensation with hotel performance measures (Namasivayam et al., 2007; Patiar and Wang, 2020). However, these compensation plans cannot replicate the high-powered incentives of  In managed and franchised hotels, the hotel chain only partially retains the role of the residual claimant through franchise and management fees. These fees are mainly linked to the number of rooms or revenues per room (ranging 1-5%) in franchising (Collins and Perret, 2019) and mainly linked to gross operating revenue (ranging 2-4%) or operating profit (under 15%) in management contracts (Balyozyan et al., 2017). franchisees tied to their position as hotel proprietors (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). Second, both franchisees and managed hotels can use their leeway as hotel proprietors to free-ride on brand equity and maximize profits at the local level at the expense of the overall interests of the hotel group. This theoretical problem translates into different types of misbehavior that have been studied for both franchises (Brickley and Dark, 1987; El Akremi ., 2011; Kidwell et al., 2007; Michael, 2002) and management contracts (van Ginneken et al2019; Schlup, 2004; Turner and Guilding, 2010). There are also differences in how free-riding is solved under these governance forms. We argue that a management contract reduces free-riding problems more easily than franchising because the former has an advantage over the latter in terms of supervision and monitoring. The general manager of the managed hotel, i.e., an employee of the brand owner, holds a more advantageous position for monitoring and preventing opportunistic behavior than the auditors, external supervisors, or mystery shoppers that a franchisor might establish to control franchisee behavior. In sum, management contracts solve free-riding on brand equity better than franchise contracts but worsen the problem of managerial shirking. This paper considers hotel size as a relevant contingency factor for assessing managerial shirking but with no significant effect on free-riding problems in hotel groups. The reason is that we consider the size of a particular hotel property and not the size of the chain (i.e., number of  Opportunistic behavior in franchise relationships usually includes failure to meet chain service and quality standards, unjustified price increases, concealment of local information useful to the chain, nonpayment of royalties, or undue deviation from standards. In management contracts, Turner and Guilding (2010) underline a horizon problem. Managed hotels will be interested in those investments that contribute most to improving the hotel’s net benefits (bottom-line) in both the short and long term. Conversely, the management company will prefer those investments that can enhance overall brand value or hotel revenue (or gross profits) in the short term (i.e.management and incentive fees). branded hotels). The number of rooms or guests directly affects the monitoring and administrative efforts required from managers (related to shirking) but not necessarily the abuse of shared brand assets (related to free-riding)—i.e., chain size and brand value could make free-riding on shared assets more appealing (Shane, 2001). A management error in a large hotel can be extremely costly because of the number of employees, assets, and guests involved. Large hotels require more planning and supervising efforts than smaller hotels because, due to the size of their operations, nothing can be left to chance (i.e., their responsiveness is very limited) (Hodari and Sturman, 2014). In line with this argument, Kosová and Sertsios (2018) found that hotels far away from their franchisor’s headquarters (i.e., more difficult to monitor) were larger, but this size effect did not exist for chain-managed hotels. This finding supports the claim that the high-powered incentives of franchisees are especially useful for operating large establishments. Furthermore, large hotels require more standardized work processes than smaller ones because other coordination mechanisms (e.g., direct supervision) are not effective in this type of organization (machine bureaucracy in terms of Mintzberg, 1979) (Baker and Cullen, 1993; Sutton and Dobbin, 1996). Franchising offers an advantage over management contracts when working under normalized environments because franchisees are used to employing standardized routines. Franchise businesses develop a set of formal and routine procedures to transfer their explicit knowledge and practices to franchisees (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). The potential cognitive, cultural, and/or interest distance with their franchisee partners, together with the impossibility of resorting to hierarchical authority to oversee franchisee behaviors, means that franchisors must develop routine procedures, rules, and policies (contained, for example, in the franchise manual) to guide cooperation between the partners (Knott, 2003; Winter, Szulanski, Ringov, and Jensen, 2012). In fact, the ability to create \"standard operating routines\" and communicate and transfer them to their franchisees is considered a key alliance capability in franchise chains (Gillis et al2020). Moreover, we expect this \"alliance management capability\" represents a differential advantage of the franchise agreement comprising the ability to ensure coordination and standardization in challenging contexts, such as in large hotels. In sum, we expect franchising to be better suited to larger hotels than management contracts, resulting in better service and online scores of large franchised (vs. managed) hotels. H3. The interaction of franchise (vs. management) contracts and hotel size has a positive effect on online scores.EMPIRICAL SETTING To test our hypotheses, we use a dataset consisting of the 250 most outstanding hotel groups with establishments in Spain during 2018. These hotel groups ran 3,105 establishments (505,752 rooms) in Spain at the beginning of 2018 out of a population composed of 3,887 hotels belonging to hotel groups (Nota, 2018). These figures do not take into account independent hotels, which were not considered in the empirical analysis because the aim of the paper leads us to focus only on hotel chains (i.e., independent hotels are always company-owned hotels, so we do not observe variability in terms of organizational forms). The Spanish hotel industry is an appropriate setting because Spain’s tourism industry is a consolidated sector, occupying the second position in the world by the number of international tourist arrivals and receipts (World Tourism Organization, 2019; p. 9). We have focused on hotels from a single country—Spain—to maintain control over the possible effect that different countries may have on the choice of governance forms (e.g.,sector organization, regulation and economic and political stability) (Lafontaine et al., 2017). Using a single country also avoids the appearance of bias in online reviews from nation-specific features (Radojevic et al., 2017). Data regarding the establishment features (governance form, stars, rooms, location, restaurants, hotel group, and opening date) were obtained from Alimarket, a well-known economic data producer in Spain. Given our interest in comparing franchising and management contracts (using chain-owned hotels as a control group), we restricted the dataset in the following way. First, we did not consider leased hotels because we did not want to contaminate our control group with other organizational forms in which different conflicts of interest might exist (real estate owner and the hotel group). Second, we also ruled out those establishments whose business concept was not the canonical example of hotel accommodation, as these might introduce noise in the estimations. We next rejected apartments, focusing only on hotels and aparthotels, because the core services differ significantly (e.g., meals, bedmaking, cleaning, etc.). Similarly, we rejected minor types, such as hostels, rural tourism establishments, and holiday villages. Finally, after rejecting those hotels for which we lacked information for all the variables, our dataset was 1,664 hotels belonging to 220 hotel groups. 3.1 Variables The dependent variable is Score, which is the weighted mean of three website scores for each hotel after homogenizing their scales. We took these scores from the Booking, Expedia, andTripAdvisor websites between March and June 2018. We weighted each website score by its number of comments. Website scores are increasingly used by hotel customers in their booking decisions (Cantallops and Salvi, 2014), thus becoming KPIs and being increasingly used in academic papers (Kwok et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). We use two different dichotomous variables to identify the governance form of hotel The variable Franchising takes the value “1” when the chain operates a hotel through a franchise contract and “0” otherwise. Similarly, the variable Management takes the value “1” when the hotel group operates the lodging establishment through a management contract. Because of our research methodology, the variable governance form also acts as a dependent variable in an auxiliary regression, in addition to a predictor of online scores. Upscale is a dummy variable that takes the value “1” if hotel has more than three stars and “0” otherwise In Spain, the hotel category is measured from one to five stars. We consider establishments with fewer than four stars to be different types of economy hotels. Conversely, upscale full-service hotels are those classified as 4- and 5-star hotels and are characterized by offering more sophisticated services and larger rooms. Specifically, 5-star hotels are featured by having the best-equipped facilities and offering the most sophisticated set of services. The variable LRooms quantifies the size of the establishment as the logarithm of its number of rooms. Renewal measures the number of years since the establishment was built or renovated and is utilized as a proxy of the establishment’s maintenance needs. Restaurants alludes to the number of eating places in the establishment and is used as a control variable. Hotel group-z are dummy variables constructed for each of the =1, …, 220) hotel groups included in the study. The list of hotel groups was extracted from the Report of Hotel Groups in Spain 2018 (Nota, 2018) and aims to control for potential hotel group effects, such as corporate strategy or preferences in terms of governance forms. Lastly, and although we refer to this in greater detail in the estimation section, to control for self-selection bias in the choice of the governance form, we use two variables as main instruments: Geographic concentration and Ratio of j-form hotelsGeographic concentrationrefers to the number of establishments of a hotel group in a province. Ratio of j-form hotelsmeasures, for each establishment , the ratio of establishments that its hotel group maintains in the same province with organizational form  over the total of the hotel group’s establishments in that province. The variables are summarized in Table 1, Table 2 displays descriptive statistics, and Table 3 shows the number of hotels in the dataset per governance form and category. Dependent Variables Definition Score Weighted mean of online ratings for hotel Franchising 1 for hotels operated under a franchise contract Management 1 for hotels operated under a management contract Independent Variables Definition Upscale 1 for a 4- or 5-Star hotel LRooms Log of the number of rooms Renewal Number of years since the hotel facility was built or renovated Restaurants Number of restaurants in the hotel.

This problem recurs in research (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Mesquita and Brush, 2008), and several authors have insisted on the fact that the choice of governance form may be made systematically rather than randomly (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Shaver, 1998). Hotel group managers may self-select into different governance forms (i.e., types of affiliated hotels). They could decide considering the alternative that they expect to be more cost-effective for the hotel group. Therefore, a simple OLS of the Score (performance) as a function of the governance form may produce biased estimations (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Mayer and Nickerson, 2005). To correct this bias, we rely on the method proposed by Heckman (1979), which consists of running a two-equation model. The first is a “treatment” model that explains the self-selection decision. The second is a performance regression, which is estimated to fit the self-selection of the first equation. The two-stage estimator used in the model is shown in Maddala (1983: 120-122) and the Stata reference manual (v.14, p. 59-64). In our case, we estimate a probit model of the treatment equation that is specified as follows: Franchising/ManagementUpscale*LRooms + Renewal +Restaurants +  Geographic concentration + Ratio of franchised hotels + Ratio of managed hotels + Ratio of chain-owned hotels + Hotel group 1 +…+Hotel group 220 + ε                             [Eq. 1]In Equation (1), is the random error term and Franchising/Management represents unobservable measures of the organizational form. Nevertheless, we do see the chosen governance form, a dichotomous variable, Franchising/Management, with Franchising/Management= 0 if Franchising/Management and Franchising/Management= 1 if  Franchising/ManagementThe second step estimates the scores conditioned by the election of the governance form and other hotel features as follows: Score =   β*Upscale + β*LRooms + β*Renewal + β*Restaurants + βFranchising/Management + β*Franchising/Management *Upscale+ *Franchising/Management *LRooms+ β*Franchising/Management*Renewal + β*Hotel group 1 +…+ β*Hotel group 220 + β*Mills_Ratio + ε                                                                                                                                                             [Eq. 2]It is important to note that we must econometrically identify Equation (1). This means that we need to introduce at least one instrument in the treatment regression (first stage) that is not considered in the performance regression (second stage). Specifically, we use Geographic concentration and Ratio of franchised/managed/chain-owned hotels as the instruments for Franchising/Management, which are the endogenous variables. We expect the ratio of hotels in a hotel group with governance form  in a given province to be inversely related to the unit costs of monitoring establishments with identical governance forms (Kosová et al., 2013). This ratio captures the unobservable costs of selecting a governance form in a given province. Besides, there may be economies of scale in the mechanisms and activities developed to control each governance form (Dahlstrom et al., 2009; Hoffman and Preble, 2003; Shane, 1996). In short, as the ratio of establishments with a given governance form in a geographic area increases, the cost of controlling additional establishments with that governance form decreases and the likelihood of choosing it for other establishments increases. The Geographic concentration variable allows us to take into account the size of the hotel group. Therefore, it facilitates weighting the effect of the economies of scale that we have approximated using the previous variable. It is reasonable to believe that neither of the two instrumental variables influences the online scores. Actually, when guests rate a hotel, they do not necessarily know either the total number of hotels of the hotel group in the province or which have the same governance form as the one in which they are staying. 3.3 Results Table 4 shows the main results reflecting the performance comparison of hotels operated under franchise and management contracts. Although our interest is in the second stage, it also shows the first-stage results for their methodological value (Appendix 1 summarizes descriptive statistics for the two-stage estimations). These resultssuggest that Heckman's correction is not needed. The coefficients of Hazardwhich is the parameter that Stata uses to estimate i.e., the correlation between the error terms of equations [1] and [2]), are not significantly different from zero, and thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between these error terms. Therefore, the equations can be considered independent because bias selection is statistically nonsignificant. Furthermore, some of our instruments are statistically significant (Ratio of franchised/managed are significant and have the expected effect on the organizational form), which suggests that they fulfill the requirement that they should be correlated with the choice of organizational form so they can identify the equation [1]. For the second stage, we estimated a baseline model with the direct effects and an augmented model in which we also consider the interactive effects of the organizational form and the features of the hotels. The results of the baseline models in Table 4 indicate, first, that the hotel scores positively depend on their category and on the number of restaurants and negatively depend on the size of the hotel (in terms of rooms) and on the renewal date of the facilities. However, the Franchising coefficient is not statistically significant, suggesting that none of these organizational forms is better on average in terms of scores. This is an expected result because it broadly supports the idea that there is no universally superior organizational form that works for all types of hotels (in regard to improving performance) (hypothesis 1). Second, the augmented model results reflect two important findings. On the one hand, we observe that when hotel groups decide to operate upscale hotels under franchise contracts, the expected performance in terms of score is lower (6F-M= -0.3475 p < 0.01) than that at upscale hotels run under management contracts. Consequently, it seems that franchising is the worst solution for higher-category hotels, as proposed in hypothesis 2. By contrast, franchising positively moderates the negative effect of hotel size on score. We obtain a positive and significant parameter for the interactive effect in Table 4 (7F-M0.1812 p < 0.05) as expected (hypothesis 3). This means that for large hotels, franchising  Please note that these two variables do not need to sum to 1 because in the ratio calculations, we consider the four existing types of organizational form. Consequently, they can be considered simultaneously in the regression. is more effective than management contracts (i.e., it mitigates the impact of size on scores).Predictors First Stage: Estimates (β) for Governance formSecond Stage: Estimates (β) for ScoreFranchising vs. Management Franchised  and Management Baseline model      Augmented model Upscale -1.0525677** .4854087*** .62254414*** LRooms .117914 -.12671228*** -.17564839*** Renewal .02982326 -.01024148* -.00789178 Restaurants .00295741 .06349429** .06690741** Franchising .06080103 -.47803964 Franchising x Upscale -.34749606*** Franchising x LRooms .18123349** Franchising x Renewal -.01079423 Geographic concentration .00847343 Ratio of franchised hotels     4.9570793*** Ratio of managed hotels -2.4955424* Hazard -.00848623  -.04150931 Cons -1.3599676 8.4227736*** 8.5241422*** 467 467 467 Goodness of fit Wald chi102.51*** =15.82 Wald chi116.26*** =17.30 LegendEstimates (standard deviation): *p<0.10; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01. Table 4: Regression models (I)As a robustness check, we also present the results from comparing the performance of franchised and managed hotels with that of company-owned hotels (Table 5). The aim of adding this comparison is twofold. First, it facilitates the comparison of our results with the extant literature and, second, it helps check the soundness of the hypotheses if they can also predict the differences with these new comparisons. Panel A compares franchised and chain-owned establishments (the dependent variable in the first stage is Franchising) and Panel B considers hotels operated under management contracts and chain-owned hotels (the dependent variable in the first stage is ManagementThe results corroborate our previous main findings. First, Panel A in Table 5 (augmented model) shows that the choice of franchising also reduces the positive effect Upscale on the expected score when compared with chain-owned hotels (6F-O0.3388 p < 0.01). Meanwhile, Panel B in 5 (augmented model) shows that managed hotels are not significantly different in terms of score from company-owned hotels for operating upscale establishments. Both results are consistent with H2, which argues that franchising is the less appropriate organizational form for operating upscale hotels. Second, the Franchising x LRooms parameter is also positive and significant in the augmented model of Panel A in 5 (7F-O= 0.1631 p < 0.1) but is not statistically significant in the estimate of Management x LRooms (Panel B in 5), which again is consistent with H3. Finally, the Management coefficient in Panel B in 5 (i.e., managed vs. owned hotels) is significant and negative (5M-O= -0.1122 p < 0.05), which suggests that management contracts deliver worse scores than company-owned hotels, irrespective of the characteristics of the hotels, in contrast to H1.

Table 5: Regression models (II)To reinforce the above results for H2 and H3, we plotted the interaction effects, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. These figures show the relationship between the category/size of the hotel (the x axis) and scores (y axis) for each value of the moderating variable (i.e.,franchise and management contract). As shown in Figure 1, as the category of the hotel increases, although both governance forms enhance scores, franchising becomes a worse choice compared to management contracts (H2) because its scores grow at a lower rate. Figure 2 shows that as the size of the hotel increases, the two forms of governance clearly have differing performance. Management contracts worsen their scores, while franchising improves them, albeit slightly (H3). Consequently, above a certain size, franchised hotels exceed the scores of managed hotels, making franchising a better option for large establishments. Figure 1: Interaction effect of the governance form (franchise vs. management contract) and the hotel category on scores 0 low1 highManagementFranchiseCategoryScores1 upscaleFigure 2: Interaction effect of the governance form (franchise vs. management contract) and the hotel size on scores DISCUSSION One of our most outstanding results is finding that franchise contracts are less effective for operating upscale hotels than management contracts. This finding is aligned with our second hypothesis, which argues that the disadvantages of franchising are more relevant in high-quality services because of the difficulties in transferring tacit knowledge. We sustain that this type of knowledge is more effectively transferred within organizations (i.e., through company-personnel interactions in daily work) than between organizations (i.e., through codification in different manuals and contractual documents). In other words, tacit knowledge is transferred more effectively in managed hotels than in franchised hotels. The initial training, remote assistance, and operations manuals (typical franchising procedures) are efficient devices for conveying explicit knowledge, but the transfer of tacit knowledge demands alternative tools (Paswan and Wittmann, 8,058,158,258,35Título del gráficoFranchiseManagementRoomsScores2009). Management contracts incorporate some of these tools because it is the company personnel themselves (e.g., the general manager) who teach the local partner as they their tasks (Ferrary, 2015; Kruesi et al., 2017; 2018). Here, employees are the repository of firms' tacit knowledge. We have not found any previous research that has compared these two organizational forms, so we cannot relate these findings to previous results. However, this weakness of franchising also holds when comparing franchised hotels with company-owned hotels (Table 5). This finding is consistent with previous results (e.g., Michael, 2000; Barthélemy, 2008), and it makes sense because company-owned establishments use the same tacit knowledge transmission system as managed properties (more effective than those in franchising). Relatedly, this argument of the tacitness of transferred knowledge has been empirically tested as a determinant of the entry mode of multinationals in host countries (Kogut and Zander, 1993). A second outstanding result is that franchising is more effective than management contracts for operating large hotels. The overall negative effect of hotel size on guests’ scores for the lodging service is more attenuated in franchised hotels than in managed establishments. This finding supports our third hypothesis that maintains that large hotels perform better when operated under the form of a franchise (vs. management contract). This is because the general manager (the franchisee) is more motivated to prevent managerial shirking than in managed hotels (an employee of the hotel group) and more used to applying standardized and codified business concepts (i.e., the franchise package is a standardization of the business model and a procedure for transfer to local partners) (Maalouf, Combs, Gillis, and Perryman, 2020). These relative advantages are especially relevant in larger hotels because both shirking (on manager effort) and the need for standardized procedures are also expected to increase with the size of the hotel (e.g.,Hodari and Sturman, 2014; Kosová and Sertsios, 2018). We have also found similar results when we compare franchising and ownership because, in terms of managerial shirking, managed hotels and company-owned hotels are similar. Kosová and Sertsios (2018) also found this correlation in their comparison of franchised and company-managed hotels. Finally, there is direct and indirect evidence corroborating the organizational fit hypothesis. The indirect clues come from the results just discussed, which show that management contracts are more suitable for operating upscale hotels, while franchising is better for operating large hotels. The direct evidence is derived from the lack of significance of the direct effects of the organizational form in most of the estimations Franchising in Tables 4 and 5). These results supporting the organizational fit hypothesis are also in line with those of other papers in different settings (., Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Fernández, González and López, 2021). However, one of our results does not support this hypothesis because the direct result of Management suggests that managed hotels outperform company-owned hotels on average, regardless of property features. Clarification of this result requires further research on management contracts (as also suggested by Hua et al., 2020), since we only control for two characteristics of the establishments in which management contracts and ownership are very similar (knowledge-transfer problem: both are personnel-based and within the organization; and managerial shirking: both are employees). However, we cannot observe the allocation between the owner of the lodging property and the hotel management company of decision rights about operations and investments that can affect parties’ (mis)behavior in different settings (e.g., Arruñada, Garicano, and Vázquez, 2001). This lack could justify our empirical findings. CONCLUSION, MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS, AND LIMITATIONS In sum, this work shows that differences exist between the two main business-to-business organizational solutions that constitute the ALFO strategy, so one size does not fit all (i.e., there is no universally superior form, and the optimum is contingent on organizational problems). Management contracts prove more effective than franchising in upscale hotels, likely because they ensure an effective tacit knowledge transfer and reduce the agency conflicts caused by the separation of real estate from brand management. Conversely, franchise agreements seem more effective than management contracts for operating large hotels, arguably because they provide high-powered incentives to prevent managerial shirking and facilitate the standardization and codification of business procedures. The theoretical implication of this work is that to advance understanding of the choice of the business-to-business relationship, it is necessary to understand not only the problem we want to solve (the replication of a business concept without large capital investments) but also the comparative advantages of the organizational solutions we apply (i.e., the management contract vs. franchising). Hua et al. (2020) have recently shown that management contracts provide value, and we claim that the relative performance differs for each of these organizational solutions in guaranteeing the replication of knowledge and preventing shirking. However, other problems might remain hidden because the property rights granted to hoteliers are not known in detail. Contractual clauses (not observed) determine the distribution of decision rights and the risk allocation for operations and investments. This type of fine-grained study (e.g.Arruñada, Garicano, and Vázquez, 2001), which already exists in other types of contracts such as franchises or alliances, is missing for management contracts and is needed to understand how they truly work. The findings of this study also have managerial implications. Hotel groups are influenced by multiple and complex (financial and strategic) criteria when choosing the governance form of their hotels. Given the increasing strategic relevance of online scores (as drivers of consumer decisions and as a key business performance indicator), it is important to be aware of how the governance choice for a hotel may influence such scores. The consequences that this choice has on the incentives of hotel general managers are crucial, since within this sector, it is an axiom that \"a hotel is only as good as its manager\" (Forte, 1986, p. 119). From this view, our study highlights important differences between hotels under management and franchise contracts, which translate into their ability to satisfy guests. Specifically, hotel group managers should be aware that franchising is weak for transferring tacit knowledge, so they must develop complementary devices for transmitting this noncontractible knowledge to the local partner. Otherwise, the use of franchising should be restricted in favor of management contracts, for example, in upscale and luxury hotels. From this perspective, it makes sense to first use a management contract, and once the transfer of tacit knowledge is guaranteed, to transfer to a franchise agreement. This hybrid form is what practitioners call “manchising” (Collins and Perret, 2019). From the opposite perspective, i.e., in terms of protecting hotel group knowledge, management contracts are more effective because the business concept is not as explicitly transferred as in franchising. This is relevant because franchisees with an entrepreneurial orientation use franchising as “schools or entrepreneurial ‘internships’” to gather new skills before launching their own brand or concept (Grünhagen, González, Hussain, and Monteiro, 2020). The hotel group can prevent this by tying the franchisee to larger investments (properties) and high-quality-tier hotels, since this makes it more difficult for them to leave. Kosová and Sertsios (2018) empirically observe this practice for distant hotels. The paper has some limitations. The first limitation is that it is difficult to have precise information about the comment review policy of each website, which undoubtedly affects the scores. Unlike several previous papers, we believe that these potential biases have been corrected by aggregating several websites that use different algorithms and are run by different people. The second problem is related to the generalization of the results. Focusing on a single country has the advantage of controlling for institutional effects on the results because they are theoretically constant but limits the validity of our results when we want to extrapolate them to other countries with different institutional environments. Therefore, a strong need exists for an international comparative study. \n",

A quantitative analysis is employed using Brazilian Franchising Association data related to 463 observations of franchisors operations in each foreign market and databases from the International Monetary Fund and Global Entrepreneurship Index.

Key words: International franchising; Entry modes; Governance modes; Stakeholder theory INTRODUCTION Franchising is an important contractual entry mode in international markets, and its relevance is reflected in the market entry and international franchising literature since the early 1990s. International franchise chains operate in an interconnected web of relationships and present complex and specific configurations. The decision-making processes involving international franchising agreements are dynamic and often lead to non-traditional structures and governance modes different from the ones observed in domestic settings and international firms in general (Brown, Dev, & Zhou, 2003; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Ludvigsson-Wallette & Lawrence, 2020; Rosado-Serrano, Paul, & Dikova, 2018).  The governance mode choice is one of the major streams in international franchising research. It investigates the decision between higher control modes, such as company-operated outlets and joint venture franchising, and lower control modes, such as franchisee-operated arrangements. Most of the studies in this field focus on profit-maximization and cost-optimization aspects, offering one-dimensional explanations based on the franchisor perspective. However, as the choice of the international governance mode configures a complex and multidimensional decision-making process, it can be influenced by several factors besides the factors considered by rational models of mode choice, including the influence exerted by internal and external stakeholders (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  Despite the acknowledged importance of the stakeholder perspective to explain international franchising phenomena (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Jell-Ojobor & Alon, 2017; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Merrilees, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018), the theory is scarcely applied in franchising research (Raha & Hajdini, 2020). Hence, the purpose of this article is to analyze the international franchising governance mode choice through the lens of stakeholder theory, verifying the influence of other stakeholders on the franchisor decision.  To achieve this purpose, we employed a quantitative analysis through OLS (ordinary least square) regression model using Brazilian Franchising Association data related to 463 observations of Brazilian franchisors operations in each foreign market from 2017 to 2019. We also used databases from the International Monetary Fund, Global Entrepreneurship Index, and a cultural distance index based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions. We found that the business groups, government agencies, and host markets' networks of stakeholders are relevant to explain the Brazilian franchisors' governance mode decisions.The article contributes to the market entry and international franchising literature as it shifts the one-dimensional focus of the rational perspectives of mode choices to a dynamic approach that considers other franchise system stakeholders. In that way, we extend the understanding of the international mode choice decision, accounting for critical aspects that increase the explanatory power of previous rational models (Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). The remainder of this article is structured as follows. After this introduction, the next section presents the theoretical background and hypotheses. The third section shows the methodology adopted. The following section offers the empirical test of the hypotheses and results. Finally, we discuss the findings and present the conclusions of the study. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND International franchising  Franchising is a contractual agreement between two legally independent parts, a franchisor, and a franchisee, in which the franchisee pays fees to the franchisor for the right to sell products or services using its brand and business system. The franchising system has been expanding steadily as a business model worldwide, with impacts on outputs, job creation, economic modernization, and entrepreneurship development. According to the World Franchise Council, the top ten most prominent countries in the number of franchise brands contain 25,483 franchisors and 2,197,716 establishments as the total number of units. In the United States, the sector has created 8,434,090 million jobs and $787.51 billion worth of outputs as of 2019.  Its growing economic relevance is reflected in academic research, generating a large amount of multi-disciplinary research (ABF, 2020; Alon, 2004; Castrogiovanni, Combs, & Justis, 2006; Dant & Grünhagen, 2014; Dant, Grünhagen, & Windsperger, 2011; FRANdata, 2020).  The franchising business model is a prominent entry mode in international markets, classified as a contractual and medium-control mode. International franchising is considered a stream of literature distinct from the domestic franchise and the broader entry modes studies because of its specific characteristics. Most of the franchise chains are service companies in which consumption and production are inseparable, creating a distinct dynamic in international expansion. Aspects related to this dynamic, such as legal issues, knowledge transfer, monitoring, and control, require more complex franchise network configurations in international markets  (Brown et al., 2003; Cavusgil, Knight, & Riesenberger, 2017; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  One of the major fields in international franchising literature is the governance mode choice. It investigates the decision between higher control modes, such as company-operated outlets and joint venture franchising, and lower control modes, such as franchisee-operated modes like master franchise agreements and area developers. These modes differ in terms of the allocations of residual income, ownership, and decision rights between the franchisor and the partners in foreign countries. The degree of franchisor's investment and control increases from modes such as master franchising to company-owned outlets, as shown in Figure 1 (Benito, Petersen, & Welch, 2009; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  ------------------------------------- Insert Figure 1 about here -------------------------------------- Company-owned outlets refer to direct investment made by the franchisor in the foreign markets. In franchising joint ventures, the franchisor enters in an equity relationship with the foreign partner to set a joint venture company, adopting a master franchising or area development agreement with the joint venture company to expand the system. In franchisee-owned outlets, the international franchisor sells the business concept to an individual franchisee in the host country. In a master franchising agreement, the franchisor grants to a master franchisee the right to operate franchise units and grant franchise rights to third parties. In an area development agreement, the franchisor grants the franchisees a defined territory in which they can develop units (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  The majority of the articles investigating franchising governance modes adopt the Agency theory (AT), Transaction Cost Theory (TCT), and Resource-Based View (RBV) as theoretical lenses, providing one-dimensional explanations focused on the franchisor perspective. Under AT and TCT, the choice of the governance mode in international markets is related to cost-minimizing and profit maximization strategies adopted by franchisors. According to RBV, the decision is connected to the franchisors' resources and competitive advantage (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  However, the choice of international governance modes configures a multidimensional and complex decision-making process. Several aspects besides the rational and cost-related concerns can influence it. For instance, franchise partners, the organizational structure of the business group, and policymakers may contribute through resources and network links that might affect the company's goals. Stakeholders such as unions, customers, suppliers, governments, and other interest groups exert pressures on the firms' decisions through explicit and implicit contracts (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). As highlighted by Brouthers and Hennart (2007), the inclusion of a multidimensional perspective such as the stakeholder theory can add a level of realism to the understanding of the international mode choice decision. Stakeholders perspective and international franchising The classical stakeholder definition given by Freeman (1984, p. 46) is \"any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objective.\" According to the stakeholder theory, besides the management concern about profit maximization and cost-optimization aspects, the claims and pressures of internal (owners, customers, employees, suppliers) and external stakeholders (governments, associations, competitors, consumers, the media) are also considered in the strategic decision making due to power, legitimacy, and urgency attributes of these stakeholders. That means management choices are a function of the stakeholders' influences (Hill & Jones, 1992; Laplume, Sonpar, & Litz, 2008; Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997; Rowley, 1997).  Despite its acknowledge relevance to explain franchise structures and dynamics (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014, 2017; Ludvigsson-Wallette & Lawrence, 2020; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018), there is a scarcity of studies that apply stakeholder theory in the franchising literature (Raha & Hajdini, 2020). Besides, most of the empirical studies adopting the stakeholder perspective to franchising research investigate topics related to corporate social responsibility. Only a few works approach international franchising decisions under a stakeholder frame of reference. Welsh et al. (2006) proposed a conceptual model of international retail franchising stakeholders in emerging markets. Altinay and Miles (2006) used the stakeholder theory to explain the selection process of international franchisees. Based on the stakeholder framework, Jung et al. (2018) analyzed the effect of corporate social responsibility on the relationship between internationalization and systematic risk. Table 1 summarizes the franchising articles applying the stakeholders' lens. ------------------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------------------- Brouthers and Hennart (2007) argue that if the stakeholders influence companies' strategic decisions, they might impact the international mode decisions as well. Through the same reasoning, Altinay and Miles (2006) propose that stakeholder theory can be applied to examine the decision-making processes in international franchising. Calls for application of stakeholder theory in international franchising are also stated by Merrilees (2014), Rosado-Serrano (2018), and Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger (2014, 2017).  The international franchising decision-making processes have specific characteristics that deviate from international firms in general. The role of stakeholders within the franchising system is complex, ambiguous, and overlapping when compared with traditional stakeholders' groups, requiring closer scrutiny to shed light on how they interact in foreign markets. Franchising creates other groups of stakeholders, such as the franchisees, employees of franchisees, institutional partners as government agencies and franchising associations, private equity, and business groups (Combs, Ketchen, Shook, & Short, 2011; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; B. Kim & Lee, 2020; Ludvigsson-Wallette & Lawrence, 2020).  Therefore, the choice of governance modes configures a decision-making process in international franchising that is dynamic and multidimensional. The learning process in global franchise groups needs to be considered, besides the cost-reduction and agency issues. For this reason, other dynamic theoretical approaches, such as the stakeholder theory, might account for important aspects influencing the international franchisor's choice of governance mode when expanding into foreign markets. Multiple other stakeholders and their complex relationships, formal and informal, influence these decisions (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014, 2017; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). This study explores the impact of three central stakeholders within the franchising system, the business groups network, government agencies, and host markets' networks.   Hypotheses  Business groups consist of individual firms linked to each other by multiple ties, coordinated by central administrative management to achieve a common goal. The main characteristics that distinguish the business groups from other organizational forms are administrative coordination and unitary direction (Cainelli & Iacobucci, 2011; Kim & Lui, 2015; Kumar, Pedersen, & Zattoni, 2008). Administrative coordination is achieved through different mechanisms such as the standardization of processes, mutual adjustment in decision planning and implementation, and direct supervision. Unitary direction consists of the \"influence over the decisions taken by the controlled companies in strategic areas such as investment, vertical integration, financial structure\" (Cainelli & Iacobucci, 2011, p. 1567).  Franchisors that belong to business groups in the domestic market might be subject to forms of unitary direction by means of pressures and influences from the group's companies and the holding management team. Besides, firms that belong to business groups obtain assets from their intragroup members, sharing valuable tangible and intangible resources (Khanna & Palepu, 2000; Kim & Lui, 2015). The stakeholders' relationships within the business groups enable dynamic exchanges and learning processes such as spillovers, imitation, resource sharing, and technological linkages, affecting their internationalization strategies. Other business group members can offer linkages with overseas firms, influencing the expansion approach through access to local structure, contacts, suppliers, and other resources (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Freeman, 1984; Hobdari, Gammeltoft, Li, & Meyer, 2017; Laplume et al., 2008; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  Therefore, being part of a business group can influence the franchisor's internationalization strategies, such as the decision about the level of control of the international governance mode. Franchisors that belong to business groups with other internationalized companies share the experience, contacts, and international partners. Thus, the business group resources and networks in the local market might favor low-control modes in foreign expansion: Hypothesis 1: Franchisors in business groups favor low-control modes in international markets. Institutional partners, such as universities, trade associations, and government agencies, are essential stakeholders for companies (Kim & Lui, 2015). The government agencies that provide financial and other support for business development are examples of key government actors that have interactions with organizations and can influence their decisions. These agencies respond to demands for efficiency and accountability, requiring compensation from companies in exchange for resources and influencing their decisions. Firms need to follow the agency's recommendations regarding strategy and investments (Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008; Parmigiani & Rivera-Santos, 2011).  Government agencies that support international business can play a major role in influencing the decisions of companies operating abroad, such as governance mode choices. Agencies programs such as the Franchising Brazil, a joint project of the Brazilian Franchising Association (ABF) and the Brazilian Agency for the Promotion of Exports and Investments (Apex-Brasil), organize trade fairs, and international commercial missions to promote experience exchange and networking. Through participation in this project, franchisors can have more opportunities to find local partners, counting on the agency's guidance and structure to develop their international expansion.  Thus, the government agency support enhances the probability of franchisors to choose low control modes since they have access to the structure and reliable partners in the local markets: Hypothesis 2: The support of government agencies favor a higher low-control mode ratio in international markets More recent developments of the stakeholder theory recognize that organizations are inserted in complex networks of relationships, each possessing its own set of stakeholders. Different stakeholder groups may interact, form alliances, and cooperate. Social network analysis is useful to explain contexts characterized by stakeholder multiplicity. The structure of the network and the organization's position within it affect the firms' reaction to the stakeholder influences (Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997). The host markets' network of stakeholders is essential as a reference group from which the franchisor can learn about their experience. They can provide critical operational knowledge about the market (Kim & Lui, 2015). When the host markets network of stakeholders is concentrated, and the local partners' relative centrality within this network is high, they have increased access and can provide or withhold access to others to the network (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997).  That is to say, in more concentrated networks, local partners with a position of centrality would offer to the franchisor access to these networks. Thus, local partners embedded in concentrated networks of stakeholders have more power and influence, obtained through the network's structure.  Thus, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 3. The more concentrated is the host market network of stakeholders, the higher the share of low-control operations. METHODOLOGYSample A representative sample of data from the Brazilian Franchising Association was used, with 463 observations about Brazilian franchisors operations in each foreign market related to the period from 2017 to 2019. The dataset has observations on 188 companies operating in 64 countries, and since there are no observations for all firms along the whole period, we considered only the most recent observation from each firm. Thus, there are 31 observations in 2017, 19 in 2018, and the remaining 413 observations were recorded in 2019. Besides the franchising dataset, we also used databases from the International Monetary Fund, Global Entrepreneurship Index and the franchising cultural distance index developed by Aliouche and Schlentrich (2011) based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions.Variables and measures Table 2 summarizes the variables adopted, measures, and sources of data. The dependent variable is the governance modes' level of control, measured by the ratio of the low-control units (franchisee-owned outlets, master franchisees' outlets, and area developers' outlets) to the total of foreign operations in each host market. We followed previous classifications that consider franchisee-operated arrangements such as franchisee-owned,  master franchisees, and area developers' outlets as low control modes (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Mumdžiev, 2011; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). The hypotheses involve three independent variables. Franchisors' enrollment in business groups (bus_group) is a dummy indicator that received the value of 1 if the franchisor is part of a business group in the domestic market, and zero otherwise. Participation in the Brazilian government agency internationalization project (gov_ag), with a value of 1 if the franchisor participates, and zero otherwise. And the network of stakeholders (network), measured through the Global Entrepreneurship Index item related to networking, which consists of how much the local entrepreneurs know each other, and their networks are concentrated. This indicator evaluates the countries' networking structure to those who want to do business, presenting higher scores for countries with more concentrated networks. For instance, the United Arab Emirates has the highest score, indicating that local entrepreneurs know each other and can make connections in the country. Trinidad and Tobago has the lowest score (GEDI, 2018).  Moreover, in conjunction with the above-mentioned independent variables, this article uses as controls several variables broadly adopted and tested by previous governance mode studies focused on profit-maximization and cost-optimization aspects: the franchisors' age (age), considering the time of existence since their foundation; franchisors' brand/reputation (adv_fee), indicator of the existence of an advertisement fee applied to franchisees; franchisors' financial resources (fee_average), measured by the average of franchising and initial fees; international experience, measured by the total number of units abroad (int_unit); international depth, measured by the number of units abroad per foreign country (un_country); host market potential, measured by the population (market_pot); economic development of the host countries (econ_devel), measured by the GDP per capita obtained from the International Monetary Fund; geographic distance (dist_geo) between home and host countries; cultural distance between home and host countries (dist_cult) accessed through the franchising cultural distance index (Aliouche & Schlentrich, 2011; Alon & McKee, 1999; Alon, Ni, & Wang, 2012; Aydin & Kacker, 1990; Baena, 2012, 2013; Burton, Cross, & Rhodes, 2000; Contractor & Kundu, 1998b, 1998b; Elango, 2007; Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014, 2017; Ni & Alon, 2010).  ------------------------------------- Insert Table 2 about here -------------------------------------- Research design Table 3 shows the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients for all variables under study. The correlation matrix revealed that correlations are relatively small. To test the hypotheses presented, the statistical method of analysis adopted was the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. All the non-binary variables are mean-centered, except for the economic development and market potential for which we used the logarithm of the GDP per capita and population, respectively. We estimate the following regression equation: 𝐿𝑂𝑊 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑅𝑂𝐿 𝑅𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂 + 𝛼𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑈𝑃𝑁𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑂𝑅𝐾𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠 + 𝛿where 𝐿𝑂𝑊 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑅𝑂𝐿 𝑅𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂 represents the governance modes' level of control, and the main variables of interest are the franchisors' participation in business groups (𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑈𝑃participation in the Brazilian government agency internationalization project (), and the features of the local network of stakeholders (𝑁𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑂𝑅𝐾) for each operation abroad. We included dummy variables to control for the sectoral fixed-effects (), and since the errors are correlated within groups of observation, the results of the regression are adjusted by standard errors clustered at the franchisors firms (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller, 2011).    ------------------------------------- Insert Table 3 about here -------------------------------------- RESULTS The results of the regression analysis are presented in Table 4. The first column (1) shows the estimates for the main variables of interest, while the column (2) shows only the control variables. Columns (3) and (4) present the estimates for the complete regression model. The latter model includes dummy variables to control the effects of the sector on the decision making of firms.   --------------------------------------- Insert Table 4 about here -------------------------------------- In general, our findings provide evidence for all three hypotheses. Results for the complete model (4) show a significant positive relationship (p <0.01) between being part of a business group and a higher low-control ratio, supporting Hypothesis 1. Stakeholders from business groups impact the franchisor's decision regarding the level of control of the international governance mode. The positive coefficient identified in the analyzed sample indicates that Brazilian franchisors' are influenced by business groups' stakeholders to choose low-control modes abroad (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008).  Hypothesis 2 asserts a positive relationship between the participation in the internationalization project of an important stakeholder, the Brazilian government, and a higher low-control mode ratio in international markets (Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008). The results confirm this hypothesis, showing a positive and significant relationship (p <0.05). Companies that participate in the internationalization project have opportunities for meeting local partners in trade fairs and missions promoted by the agency to facilitate the Brazilian franchisors' international expansion. With the guidance and help of an official government agency, franchisors can find reliable foreign partners and opt for low-control modes abroad. Results for the model (4) also support Hypothesis 3, showing a positive and significant effect (p <0.05) of the host markets network of stakeholders in a higher share of low-control operations. Local partners with more concentrated and strong networks can provide access to franchisors within the network, consisting of an important resource and advantage to the international expansion. Thus, franchisors expanding to host markets with local entrepreneurs that know each other and have concentrated networks have strong incentives to opt for low-control modes (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997). The results for the control variables' economic development and market potential are significant and show a negative relationship with the low-control ratio, as previously verified. More developed host countries with a higher market potential increase the incentives for high-control modes (Baena, 2012, 2013; Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995). The geographic distance has a positive relationship with the low-control mode ratio. Low-control modes can reduce monitoring costs in distant markets (Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995).  The cultural distance is negatively related to the low-control mode ratio. Cultural distance is a variable analyzed by several previous works, but the results are contradictory or inconclusive (Aliouche & Schlentrich, 2011; Baena, 2012, 2013; Baena & Cerviño, 2014; Burton et al., 2000; Contractor & Kundu, 1998a, 1998b; Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995). Contractor and Kundu (1998b) argue that the mixed results in empirical studies for cultural distance might be related to the contradictions between the need of local partners in culturally distant markets and the challenges related to the absorptive capacity of local partners in different cultural settings.  The international experience has a negative relationship with a higher low-control mode ratio, consistent with previous research. Franchisors with more international experience have more knowledge of how to do business abroad, reducing the risks and costs of choosing high control modes (Baena, 2012; Baena, 2013; Contractor & Kundu, 1998b, 1998a).  International depth is positively related to low-control ratio. Franchisors with more units in the same country have more low-control mode operations. Franchisee-operated modes such as master franchising and area development agreements usually define a territory in which local partners can develop units (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). DISCUSSION The empirical analysis reveals that internal and external stakeholders influence the Brazilian franchisors' decisions regarding international governance modes. The franchisors' relationships within the business groups in the domestic market, with government agencies that support international business and with host markets' networks of stakeholders, impact the choice between low and high-control modes in foreign markets.  Being part of business groups has a positive relationship with a higher low-control ratio. That means, business group firms and the holding management team influence franchisors to choose low-control modes in international markets. Other internationalized companies within the same business groups can share experience, structure, and contacts with partners in foreign markets. Different companies from the same business group engage in action coordination and joint agreements with local partners to develop their operations (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Hobdari et al., 2017). One example is the Brazilian franchising group Paquetá - The Shoe Company, which controls the firms Dumond and Capodarte. Dumond started its internationalization in the 2000s with franchisee-operated modes. Capodartefollowed the same strategy, learning from Dumond's experience and counting with its local partners (Paquetá - The Shoe Company, 2015; Silva & Silva, 2014).   The participation in the internationalization project of the Brazilian government agency, Franchising Brazil Project, have a positive relationship with a higher low-control ratio, too. The agency can facilitate encounters with reliable foreign partners and thus influence franchisors to opt for low-control modes abroad (Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008; Parmigiani & Rivera-Santos, 2011). This was the case of the Brazilian foodservice franchisor Hot n' Tender – HNT. In 2018, the company participated in a mission to the Multi-Unit Franchising Conference Las Vegas promoted by Franchising Brazil Project. In this mission, the company signed a contract with the Rohan Group, a multi-unit franchisee, to open 50 outlets of the brand in the USA until 2025 (Apex-Brasil, 2020).  The structure of the host markets stakeholders' network also influences the Brazilian franchisors' decisions.  Franchisors expanding to host markets with more concentrated networks have strong incentives to choose low-control modes (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997). These results are aligned with de Almeida et al. (2018) findings of a qualitative study. They showed that the Brazilian franchisor Young Free (fictitious name), a textile company, decided to operate in the United Arab Emirates with a master franchisee because of its history of doing business in the country. In the United Arab Emirates, a country with a highly concentrated network of stakeholders in which local entrepreneurs know each other and can make connections (GEDI, 2018), the choice of a low-control governance mode with a local partner embedded in the business environment was more suitable.  CONCLUSIONIn this article, we analyzed the international franchising governance mode choice through the stakeholder lens. We verified the influence of other franchise system stakeholders on the franchisors' decisions. The results revealed that business groups, government agencies, and the host markets' network of stakeholders significantly impact the international governance mode choices. Being part of business groups in the domestic market, government agencies' support, and a more concentrated host market network of stakeholders increase the low-control mode ratio in international markets. Our findings contribute to the entry mode and international franchising literature as we shift the one-dimensional focus of the rational perspectives of mode choices to a dynamic approach that considers other franchise system stakeholders. By doing so, we amplify the understanding and bring more realism to the international governance mode choice research as suggested by several scholars (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Jell-Ojobor & Alon, 2017; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). This study also provides a managerial contribution to franchisors seeking international expansion, presenting aspects to be evaluated and considered to the international governance mode choice.  Limitations One limitation of our study is the lack of data for other potentially relevant variables related to the stakeholder theory. For instance, future research can incorporate the firm's size to verify whether the influence of stakeholders on governance mode decisions changes according to the franchisors' size. Another limitation is related to possible home country context issues that might impact the role of stakeholders on governance mode decisions. The analysis presented is related to a sample of Brazilian franchisors. In order to understand possible context-related differences, a cross-national sample is needed. We also recognize that other stakeholders may have an important contribution to international franchising decisions, for instance, the host markets' government, employees, customers and the franchisees. Franchisees usually assume multiple stakeholder roles, taking aspects of customer, employee, and owner (Raha & Hajdini, 2020), and this is an feature that would benefit from further research in the international franchising stream. \n",

Franchise System Configurations for High Performance: The Role of Dynamic Capabilities and Know-How Abstract The performance drivers of franchise systems have spawned considerable research interest. Almost exclusively this research has relied on independent sets of explanatory variables in linear analyses. These analyses mask the complex interdependencies that are likely to exist among key success factors, leading to faulty theory and misspecified implications for practice. In this paper, we propose a model that consistently articulates dynamic capabilities, operational capabilities (know-how) and performance. This model provides a canvas to a configuration approach to franchise system performance that accounts for complex interdependencies among dynamic capabilities, know-how and franchise ownership conditions (plural form versus “turnkey” franchisors). Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of a sample of 119 France-based franchisors, the authors identify necessary and sufficient conditions to business format franchise system performance. These conditions include dynamic capabilities, both business and organizational know-how, and franchise ownership strategy that form causal paths towards franchise system performance. The study allows identifying the main know-how that are crucial (necessary) to performance and, in association with dynamic capabilities and depending upon the franchise ownership strategy, the conditions under which these different capabilities lead to high performance. We deepen the current understanding of configurations that promote the performance of franchise systems, offer important implications for theory and practice, and set new directions for future research on the strategic management of franchise systems. Key words: configuration approach, dynamic capabilities, fsQCA, know-how, performance INTRODUCTION Dynamic capabilities (DC), defined as “the firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516), are fundamental to firms' differential performance. Their role in firm strategy, value creation, and competitive advantage has attracted a great deal of interest among scholars (e.g. Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Helfat et al., 2007; Teece, 2007). Theoretical arguments have been advanced about the nature of DC and their relationship with firm performance. Research has found that DC are conducive to superior firm performance (Wang et al., 2015). However, the question as to why and under what conditions some firms are better at developing and applying DC than others remains under-researched and the debate about DC has reached a point where theoretical arguments should be further complemented by relevant empirical work (Protogerou et al., 2012). The question of whether and how DC affect performance is still open (Helfat et al., 2007). In addition, some scholars have limited the consideration of DC only in rapidly changing environments (e.g. Teece et al., 1997; Teece, 2007) leaving open the examination of their role under other environmental conditions.  This study aims to investigate how franchise systems can achieve high levels of performance under different configurations of DC and operational capabilities labeled as know-how (KH). In this study, DC are conceptualized as higher order strategic processes that integrate, recombine, and generate franchisors’ new organizational KH and franchisees’ new local KH, which in turn shape franchise system performance. We operationalize DC as a composite, unified construct defined by two interrelated, although distinct, dimensions: sensing capability and adaptive capability. Using a survey design in business format franchising, we consider KH at both organizational and local levels and we attempt to identify the KH that are decisive to performance. Finally, we introduce the franchising rate (proportion of franchised units in the system), a variable that reflects the strategic choice regarding the system development and the challenges it faces. By articulating DC and KH in relation to performance in different contexts and from the franchisors’ view, we aim to inform about the diversity of relevant dimensions of capabilities that form franchise management capabilities (Gillis et al., 2020).  This article contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it makes an explicit distinction between the DC higher order construct and operational capabilities. The relationship between DC and operational capabilities (know-how) cannot be considered as direct and linear, and both dynamic and operational capabilities have to be examined together in their relationship with performance. Our methodology, based on fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), is consistent with this framework and our results confirm the validity of this postulate. Second, it declines and explores the link between DC, operational capabilities, and performance in the context of franchising, in which the concept of DC has not been often used yet. We contend that DC and the franchise ownership strategy (plural form versus “turnkey” franchisors who franchise all, or almost all units), together with know-how (KH), allow for the identification of quasi-sufficient conditions for high performance in franchise systems. The results enrich the understanding of high-performing recipes to performance in franchise systems. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Dynamic capabilities and operational capabilities “Dynamic capabilities are the firm’s processes that use resources—specifically the processes to integrate, reconfigure, gain and release resources—to match and even create market change. Dynamic capabilities thus are the organizational and strategic routines by which firms achieve new resource configurations and markets emerge, collide, split, evolve, and die” (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000, p. 1107). DC consist of specific strategic, organizational, and managerial processes such as strategic decision making, new business units’ development, alliances creation, and product development, which create value for the firm within dynamic markets by manipulating and reconfiguring resources (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997).  Teece (2018) argues that DC are easier to understand in the context of an organization's overall portfolio of capabilities, which can be thought of as working on two levels (Winter, 2003). At the base level are operational and other ordinary capabilities, the routine activities and administration that allow any organization to pursue a deﬁned set of activities, more or less efﬁciently. Above these is a layer of DC, which can be divided into “microfoundations” and higher-order capabilities (Teece, 2007). Microfoundations, which involve the adjustment and recombination of a firm’s existing ordinary capabilities as well as the development of new ones, are second-order DC. “Guiding these are the high-order dynamic capabilities by which management, supported by organizational processes, senses likely avenues for the future, devises business models to seize new or changed opportunities, and determines the best conﬁguration for the organization based on its existing form and the new plans for the future” (Teece, 2018, p. 41). In our paper, we will be referring to the DC as well as to the operational capabilities (labeled as KH). Dynamic and operational capabilities differ in their purposes and intended outcomes (Helfat and Winter, 2011). Following Protogerou et al. (2012), capabilities can be either operational or dynamic and they both reflect the firm’s capacity to perform a particular activity or function, but they can be distinguished along the two following aspects: “(i) operational capabilities help the firm to perform basic functional activities; while (ii) DC are referring to the transformation and reconfiguration of operational capabilities”. Assuming a hierarchical view of capabilities, we consider that higher-order DC serve as a basis for acquiring and reconfiguring lower-level capabilities in order to make a sustainable living.Relationships among dynamic capabilities, operational capabilities and performance The definition of DC specifies that, regardless of any ultimate effect, the effect of DC is primarily on the firm’s operational capabilities. In this way, the concept of DC is not necessarily linked to firm performance but foremost to the ability to reconfigure operational capabilities. Therefore, this definition specifies that DC can create value indirectly by changing operational capabilities. Any impact of DC on firm performance is “mediated” by operational capabilities.  This perspective consistently articulates DC with the resource-based view (RBV) framework. Following the RBV, each pool of resources –including operational capabilities- has its own intrinsic performance. This performance is dependent upon its VRIN (valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable) or VRIO (O for organization) attributes (Barney, 1991, 2002). However, a pool of resources is not forever VRIN and a source of superior performance. In an evolving social, economic and technological environment, these operational capabilities have to be modified and adapted to maintain a high level of efficiency and performance. DC come in as they allow creating, adjusting, reconfiguring, and leveraging resources and operational capabilities. Hence, operational capabilities and DC are directly linked to each other, but they do not play the same role regarding performance. Operational capabilities relate to technical fitness, defined by how effectively a capability performs its function, regardless of how well the capability enables a firm to make a living (Helfat et al., 2007). Some operational capabilities will be conducive to performance (they are “VRIN”), while others will not. Nevertheless, operational capabilities directly relate to present performance, although not in a linear and monotonic way, depending on their VRIN characteristics. DC are in appearance more directed toward performance because they relate to evolutionary or external fitness, that is to how well the capability enables a firm to make a living (Helfat et al., 2007). Evolutionary fitness references the selection environment and concerns sustainable or long-term performance. However, theoretically, there is no direct relationship between DC and the present performance of the firm, but only a direct relationship between DC and operational capabilities. DC drive to performance only because they allow creating or adjusting news capabilities, which present VRIN characteristics. Qualifying the relationships in terms of necessity and sufficiencyBecause there is no high performance without VRIN operational resources or capabilities in RBV, the relationship between operational capabilities and performance is of a necessary nature. This statement simply establishes that if we observe a firm with high performance, there must be some (VRIN) operational capabilities sustaining and explaining this performance. This does not mean that all or some operational capabilities will systematically lead to performance. There can be plenty of operational capabilities, effective at operating some particular tasks in a firm, which result in low performance if these capabilities or tasks are not useful to firm competitive advantage. Hence, operational capabilities are necessary to achieve high performance, but they are not sufficient. Even taking the definition of an operational capability at a certain level of generality, there is not one “super” capability, which would be sufficient by itself and forever to achieve high performance. An operational capability or a particular bundle of operational capabilities will lead to high performance only in some contexts and under particular conditions. Hence, operational capabilities are in a relation of necessary nature with performance, but they are not sufficient on their own to achieve high performance. For an operational capability or a bundle of capabilities to retain their VRIN feature and lead to high performance, it has to be reshaped from time to time. DC, by creating, adjusting, reconfiguring, and leveraging resources and operational capabilities play this role. Hence, in conjunction with operational capabilities (that they contribute to leverage, create, and adapt), DC can be seen as a sufficient condition to performance. Neither DC nor operational capabilities are sufficient by themselves. They are insufficient taken alone, but sufficient taken together (at least in some contexts). Hence, one can define DC in conjunction with operational capabilities (and vice versa) as quasi-sufficient or INUS condition for performanceEstablishing and qualifying the fundamental relationships between operational capabilities and DC allows the concepts to be properly articulated. However, it remains to give them substance: what are the core operational capabilities (or KH) that constitute the necessary conditions for high performance in franchise systems? How and under which conditions do they articulate with DC to lead to high performance? Figure 1. A model of the relationships among dynamic capabilities, operational capabilities and performance Legend: Operational capabilities are necessary conditions to high performance, and consistently, the set of high performing franchise systems is included into the set of systems with valuable operational capabilities. Sufficient conditions to high performance necessitate the articulation of some operational and some DC, under certain conditions. The set of high performing franchise systems is at the intersection of these three sets.                                                  In terms of FsQCA, dynamic and operational capabilities would be qualified as INUS condition. INUS means “Insufficient condition but Necessary part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition”. This is exactly what dynamic and operational capabilities in relation to performance are. Taken alone, they are insufficient, but taken together they are (necessary) part of a sufficient condition (although this condition is not necessary: it exists plenty of other conditions that can lead to high performance).Environmental or organizational conditions Set of (systems with) DC Set of (systems with) operational capabilities Set of high performing franchise systems DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES, OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES AND PERFORMANCE IN FRANCHISE SYSTEMS We consider the different franchise systems’ KH as operational capabilities. These can be understood as the “zero-order” capabilities needed for performing effectively day-to-day activities, such as offering particular products or addressing specific customer’s needs. Their renewal and reshaping by DC according to the franchisor’s strategic intent and environmental needs might be a prerequisite for sustainable competitive advantage. Operational capabilities: transferring valuable know-how at the local level and controlling the system We consider operational capabilities from the franchisor’s point of view, but we acknowledge that several operational capabilities or KH are transferred or even created at the franchisee level. Franchisors provide their franchisees with two major strategic assets—brand name and business practices. Specifically, they provide manufacturing capabilities, regulatory KH, information on managing and deploying their sales forces, and standard operating processes to manage franchised units effectively (Hoang and Rothaermel, 2010; Knott, 2003; Watson and Stanworth, 2006). The primary task of a franchisor is to create and maximize value through optimally transferring KH to franchisees. Beyond these franchisor-owned strategic assets, franchisors also build value creation on knowledge-sharing routines (Gillis et al., 2014). These routines include advice from franchisee consultants, newsletters, and national, regional, and local meetings. These routines not only allow franchisors to communicate current standards and to monitor franchisees, they also allow them to learn about franchisees’ adaptations or innovations, and then to share successful changes throughout the system (Bradach, 1998). They also allow franchisees to share ideas and learn from one another. Hence, the value creation in a franchise system does not only depend on the franchisor’s KH and operational capabilities, but also on the symbiosis between these partners, and on the franchisees’ KH and capabilities. The KH we have discussed so far are those, which are transferred to the franchisees and to the system units. They can be defined as “business KH” and are at the heart of value creation in franchise systems. They operate at the local level, but the franchisor remains in charge of these KH.  Other KH, which can be qualified as organizational, are not transferred to local units and are the exclusive responsibility of the franchisor. These organizational KH are numerous. We can mention the codification and transmission of knowledge to franchisees, the support to human resources management for franchisees, and the internal cohesion management (El Akremi et al., 2009). Among these organizational KH, one -namely the control of the system- is crucial to system performance, although probably in a contingent way (Yakimova, Owens, and Sydow, 2019). The franchise literature emphasizes the role of monitoring (Combs et al., 2011). Indeed, to protect the brand value and the business practices transferred to local units, the franchisor must deter deviant and opportunistic behaviors and must ensure that the business practices are correctly implemented. The need for the mastering of such monitoring capabilities is nevertheless contingent. A good mastering of control capabilities will be of greater importance for high performance when the system uniformity and integrity is at risk. Franchisors can also develop some KH that substitute/limit or complement the need to monitor the franchisees. In this regard, the management of internal cohesion in the system is an important capability, that is akin to relational form of governance (Cochet, Dormann, and Ehrmann, 2008). Having a good mastering of internal cohesion capability could limit the monitoring need or it could effectively complement it by making the franchisees more collaborative and proactive, e.g. in their reporting and their audits. Controls are not only coercive but also enabling (Yakimova et al., 2019). Including the mastering of cohesion in the system in the analysis makes it possible to consider the concept of control in a broader sense that is not limited to its monitoring or disciplinary nature. It allows embracing more broadly- even if not completely- the franchise management capabilities (Gillis et al, 2020), which are “the main cognitive, behavioral, and organizational routines that enable a franchisor to achieve both standardization and adaptation in working with franchisees\"Among the different KH in a franchise system, we contend that the 3 KH evoked -namely having a business KH of value and mastering the control and/or cohesion organizational KH- are crucial to performance. Consequently, we posit: H1: Business KH of value, mastering the control and/or cohesion organizational KH constitute altogether a necessary condition to high performance.  In terms of fsQCA: (Business KH of value + Mastering of control KH+ Mastering of cohesion KH)  High performance The sign “+” represents an inclusive or logical “or”. In terms of set theory, it refers to an union. The backward arrow means “is necessary for”. We could rephrase H1 by saying that the set of high performing systems is included into the union of the sets of highly valued business KH, and good mastering of control and cohesion organizational KH.                                                  Gillis et al. (2020) do not distinguish between KH and DC in the definition of their franchise management capability construct. Part of these management capabilities are subsumed in DC in our framework.H1 states that having one or the other of the three KH (or any combination of two of them or the combination of the three) is necessary to high performance. It might be that some combinations of two KH only constitute a necessary condition to high performance. This is an empirical issueFinally, there should be no misunderstanding regarding the purpose of this hypothesis. If H1 were to be not corroborated, it would not call into question the theoretical framework and model (which are by themselves not testable, but rather useful or not). It would rather indicate that high performance in franchise systems is based on a set of KH that is larger (or differently structured) than the three KH retained in our study tests. The fact that KH, if properly chosen, constitutes a necessary condition for high performance follows from our theoretical framework. However, it does not inform us about the main concern in management: under what circumstances do these KH lead to high performance, i.e can we find some conditions for the KH to be a sufficient condition to high performance? In that regard, as already outlined, a good mastering of control capabilities will be of greater importance for high performance when the system uniformity and integrity is at risk. The franchise literature identifies the development mode- a strategic variable reflected by the proportion of franchised units in the system- as such a risk (Gillis and                                                  On a theoretical ground, we can mention that H1 has a corollary. Indeed, if the union of the three KH is a necessary condition to high performance it follows that not mastering any of these KH is a sufficient condition to low performance.  Corollary of H1: Not mastering any of the KH is a sufficient condition to low performance. In fsQCA terms: (worthless Business KH * weak mastering of control KH * weak mastering of cohesion KH)  low performance The sign “*” represents an “and”, it refers to an intersection in terms of theoretic set. The arrow means “is sufficient for”. Combs, 2009; Gillis et al., 2020). First, because it refers to the acuteness of the risk of free riding in the system, as more franchisees in a system entails a greater risk of free riding (Michael, 2000). Furthermore, systems that make strong use of franchising compared to their rivals may have advantages regarding system innovation (especially at the local level), but at the expense of higher risks for system uniformity and probably at the expense of the plural form symbiosis itself (El Akremi et al., 2015). When the franchising rate increases, the franchisors' risk of losing control over business processes is greater (El Akremi et al., 2015). A high level of company ownership, in contrast, promotes standardization and guarantees valuable replication. It may help to diffuse novelty across the entire system while maintaining uniformity. The specific advantage of hierarchy via company ownership is that it helps secure chainwide standardization and increases strategic flexibility (Gillis and Combs, 2009). The mastering of control capabilities is thus crucial to achieve high performance when the franchising rate is high. On the contrary, in systems with low franchising rates, control and uniformity in the system may be maintained without necessarily mastering such capabilities. Hence: H2: A good mastering of control KH is a quasi-sufficient condition in a context of high franchising rate (or in “turnkey systems”).In fsQCA terms: (High franchising systems * good mastering of control capabilities) high performance The notion of quasi-sufficiency deserves further explanations. In fsQCA, we could reframe H2 by saying that “a good mastering of control KH” is an “INUS” condition of performance (Insufficient (by itself) but Necessary part of an Unecessary but Sufficient condition)”. This means that: i) the good mastering of control alone is not sufficient to lead to high performance, it will necessarily be associated with other conditions, in particular but not solely, a high franchising rate in H2 (“insufficient by itself but necessary part of”); and ii) There may be many other configurations that lead to high performance but do not necessarily include the control KH and a high franchising rate (“an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition”). In other words, our hypothesis stipulates that there will be at least one configuration in which the association of at least the good mastering of control KH and high franchising rate lead to high performance. However, particularly in our context where the different KH may interact to deliver high performance, we do not dismiss that the high performing configuration that associates control KH and high franchising rate, also further includes other KH. An association of control and cohesion KH would indicate that these KH are complementary rather than substitutes. The value of business KH could also integrate the configuration as business and organizational KH are interrelated in franchise systems (Perrigot et al., 2020). Whatever the specific form of this expected configuration, we expect that it will cover a significant part of all high performing configurations, but as the point underlined in point ii), many other high performing configurations may exist that do not include neither control nor a high franchising rate.  Dynamic Capabilities We expect that the system and local capabilities can be at the source of competitive advantage in certain contexts. However, exogenous (e.g. economic, technological) as well as endogenous (executive replacement, franchising rate) changes might well jeopardize this competitive advantage. To ensure the sustainability of operational capabilities as a source of competitive advantage and to promote long-term performance, the franchise system should develop DC. In other words, the ingredients we gave in H2 are not the whole recipes of configurations that drive to high performance. They constitute only a part of the recipe and we now include the DC in the analysis.Although DC are not to be analyzed in sequential terms (Gelhard et al., 2016), they are often decomposed in different subcomponents in a seemingly chronological order: sensing, seizing and reconfiguring/transforming (e.g. Teece, 2007; Ellonen et al., 2009) or absorptive, adaptive and innovative (e.g Wang et al., 2015). These categorizations can be applied to the context of franchising. The sensing component of DC relates to the “the ability of a firm to recognize the value of new, external information” (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990, p. 128). In the franchising context and from the franchisor’s point of view, this capability relates to the capability to capture and evaluate information from the environment from external partners as well as from franchisees. Hence, in our context, this capability is outward and inward looking. It is also linked to knowledge sharing (operating) routines between the franchisor and franchisees. Adaptive and innovative capabilities are sometimes gathered into transformative capabilities (Pandza and Holt, 2007; Wang et al., 2015), which relate to a firm’s ability to constantly redefine a portfolio of product or service opportunities based on knowledge endogenous to the firm (Pandza and Holt, 2007). These DC relate to the adaptation of operational capabilities at the franchisor level (e.g. capacity to integrate new knowledge, reconsideration of existing practices) and to the ability to foster innovation (e.g. use of information to launch novel product or services, ability to engender and support innovative behavior for franchisees but also for managers, new methods of production and new ways of doing things within the firms).  In our framework, all these dynamic sensing and transformative capabilities apply to the organizational as well as to business (local) operational capabilities. They are intended to adapt existing operational capabilities or to create novel capabilities when necessary, to enable the firm to make a living on the long run. By themselves, or in conjunction with operational capabilities, these DC constitute “franchise management capabilities” (Gillis, et al., 2020). A general hypothesis from these observations is straightforward. As DC are intended to make it possible to maintain the effectiveness of organizational KH and the value of the KH transferred to franchisees, we expect DC to be quasi-sufficient condition to high performance in association with KH. In other words, we expect to observe the presence of good sensing  good adaptive capabilities in conjunction with one or some KH in high performing configurations. Accordingly: H3: Sensing or adaptive DC are, in conjunction with KH, INUS conditions to performance included in high performing configurations.  Noting SENS the sensing DC and ADAP the adaptive DC, we state H3: (SENS + ADAP)*(Business KH of value + Mastering of control KH+ Mastering of cohesion high performance This hypothesis indicates that high performing configurations must include simultaneously DC and KH. This statement is theoretically correct. We expect in our framework that most high performing configurations will include these conditions but not necessarily all high performing configurations. Indeed, our model includes business KH, control and cohesion capabilities as the focal and most important KH in relation to performance. We nevertheless recognize that other organizational KH, not accounted for in our model, exist that could also be relevant for high performance in some contexts. It is quite conceivable that the (sensing and adaptive) DC apply to other organizational KH not included in our model to deliver performance. In other words, we cannot discard that some high performing configurations will exhibit only one or the other DC, and none of the operational capability retained in our model. These potential cases have a simple interpretation: in these configurations, the DC apply to other (non-measured) operational capabilities. Nevertheless, we expect that only few configurations will include DC without at least one of the operational capabilities, as we included in our model the most important and expected KH for high performance in franchise systems. Finally, we may observe some high performing configurations that exhibit only operational capabilities and no DC. These cases would refer to configurations where performance is more tenuous and less sustainable on the long term.  METHODOLOGY Sample and data collection Both mail and face-to-face survey methods were used to collect data from France-based franchisors. We used the franchise listings provided by the Fédération Française de la Franchise (French Franchise Federation) to obtain the franchisors' contact details. We also contacted franchise systems that were not in the listings but who had participated in a prior research project conducted by the authors. A total of 930 top executives of franchise systems actively operating in France were contacted in December 2017. The survey was addressed to the managing directors of each franchise organization. Our target respondents also included top executives with a deep understanding of the orientation of the franchising strategy, including network directors, directors of development and franchise directors. Because dynamic and operational capabilities are an organization-level construct, we believe that these respondents are appropriate informants for capturing dynamic and operational capabilities in their franchise organizations.  After three reminders at the beginning of 2018, we received a total of 108 questionnaires (at least partially completed). As a complementary data-collection method, we conducted personally administered surveys at the annual meeting of Salon de la Franchise(Franchise Exhibition) in March 2018. Fifty-five questionnaires were then gathered. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded, bringing the total number of usable questionnaires to 119. Our final sample consisted of 119 franchise organizations, for an overall response rate of 12.8%. By way of comparison, there were 1900 franchise systems in France in 2016. Considering that this study required the involvement of top franchise executives, the sample size is considered appropriate, and a similar sample size has been reported in prior studies investigating the strategic management of franchising systems. For example, Dada and Watson (2013) collected 95 usable questionnaires. A non-response bias analysis was conducted by comparing early versus late responses (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). We also conducted t-test comparisons between mail survey respondents and face-to-face survey respondents. According to the tests, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean responses for the constructs that were measured in the study.  Table 1. Sample characteristics Franchise systems’ characteristics Frequency Age  Less than 5 years 24% 6-10 years  24% 11-20 years 23% More than 20 years  29% Total100% Size 1-50 units  45% 51-100 units 18% 100-150 units More than 150 units 28% Total 100% Industry sector  Construction and estate agents Miscellaneous retail Food retail 10 % Domestic goods retail 11% Personal goods retail 8 % Hotels and restaurants 15% Hairdressing and beauty Services to individuals  18% Automobile services  Business services  12% Total 100% The sample includes both young and well-established franchise systems, along with both very small and very large franchise systems in various sectors (Table 1). The average age of franchise systems, defined as the number of years the company has been franchising, was 15 years, and the average size was 97.5 franchised units. These figures and the sample distributions are very close to the sample of the CSA 2016 survey on franchising which is representative of the French franchise systems (average age =14 years; average size=95 units). MeasuresA research instrument was developed to serve as a basis for collecting data pertaining to DC, operational capabilities, and franchise system performance. Where possible, existing constructs and measures were used to ensure their validity. All questionnaire items were operationalized using self-typing seven-point Likert scales, ranging from 1, strongly disagree, to 7, strongly agree. It should be noted that operationalization of resources and capabilities in empirical research has not yet reached standard measures (Protogerou et al., 2012). In this study, the development of scales was based on theoretical contributions from resource-based scholars (eg. Teece et al., 1997). For a complete overview of all the items used in the survey, please refer to the Appendix 1. DC construct was gaged by using two sub-dimensions, namely sensing and adaptive capabilities, while each of them was measured with specific items. In sum, we measured DC as a higher-order reflective construct using 19 items, which were adapted from Wang et al. (2015). To measure operational capabilities, franchisors were asked to indicate in a seven-point scale the degree to which different types of organizational KH were well mastered in their systems and the degree to which the different types of local KH transferred to franchisees were rare and inimitable, on several items. The monitoring/control side of organizational KH was measured with 4 items. The Cohesion capability was also measured through 4 items. To measure the value of business KH, we used the scale developed by El Akremi et al. (2009) and Ghantous et al. (2013), based on 9 items. These items allow qualifying the nature of business KH, especially regarding their scarcity and inimitability. Performance is a multidimensional concept for which it is possible to find a wide diversity of measurements (Rauch et al., 2009). This study uses perceived measures to operationalize franchise system performance. The two most commonly used measurements of franchise performance are system growth (e.g., Combs and Ketchen, 2003; Kaufmann and Dant, 1996; Shane, 1996) and financial performance (e.g., Combs and Ketchen, 2003; Hoover et al., 2003; Lafontaine, 1992; Michael, 2003). The first measurement reflects the increase in the number of franchised units. The second measurement is typically framed in terms of sales and/or profits. To assess the performance of franchise systems, we used the integrative measurement of entrepreneurial performance (Chandler and Hanks, 1993; Murphy et al., 1996) that integrates both growth and financial measurements.  Using a framework derived from the literature on alliances, Gillis et al. (2020) focus on three dimensions that reflect franchise management capabilities: communication, coordination and bonding. They aggregate these different operational capabilities into a multidimensional construct reflecting \"management capabilities\". By using a different framework, we distinguish the components of franchise management capabilities between KH and DC of adaptation and detection. In our framework it is the articulation between these capabilities and not their aggregation that constitutes the franchise management capabilities. Beyond these differences, we find similarities in the concepts measured: the \"knowledge sharing routines\" of Gillis et al. (2020), for example, are for us adaptive DC; the \"trust routines\" rather refer to the KH of cohesion while the standard operating routines are closer to the KH of control. Validation of measures Particular efforts have been made to minimize measurement errors and potential bias. In essence, construct validation of the perceptual measures was tested in two basic steps. The first one checked for content validity, requiring the identification of a group of measurement items, which are deemed to represent the construct of interest. The scales concerning DC measures were developed based on theoretical contributions and especially Teece et al.’s (1997) DC framework. The operational capabilities and franchise system performance scales employed have been adapted from existing and validated scales used in the franchising literature. Table 2.

This first axis explains much (44.14%) of the sum of total variance explained by the 3 first axes (71.61%). Dimension 2 (14.46%) relates to the “specificity” of the business KH, while dimension 3 (13.01%) relates to the sustainability of the value of business KH. Franchise system performance (5 items) Related (calibrated) variable in FsQCA: PERF0.920 0.804 The second step addressed construct validity, seeking to establish the extent to which the empirical indicators actually measure the construct. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s . All constructs exceed the recommended level of 0.7 and therefore the specified indicators are sufficient in their representation of the constructs (Table 2). Hence, all analyses provide reasonable confidence that the measures used in the present study are valid and reliable. Method of analysis The configurational approach is primarily based on the fundamental premise that in a RBV framework, which articulates dynamic and operational capabilities, the strategic development of the system and performance cannot rely only on linear or curvilinear relationships between these elements. Efforts to estimate average relationships are indeed inconsistent with a central assumption of resource-based view —that firms maximize value by choosing strategies that exploit their heterogeneous resources and individual situation (Mackey et al., 2017). fsQCA is a normative model of set-theoretic connections and is applied as an analytical tool in social sciences. Since several problems of social science can be formulated in terms of sets and set relations (Ragin, 2008), in which high values of a causal statement are not necessarily sufficient for high values of a dependent variable to occur (Woodside, 2013), the fsQCA method can identify these asymmetric relationships. It has been applied throughout management and innovation research to test set-theoretic relationships in social science models (Aversa et al., 2015; Brenes et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2013; Woodside, 2013). The set-theoretic method applied focuses on configurations of variables as sets in which cases have membership or not. The first step in this method is to calibrate our variable so that a franchisor is said to belong to a set (e.g. “high performing system”, “good mastery of KH”…) or not. The attribution of cases to sets is called calibration. Different methods of calibration exist. We use a simple method that rank orders the variable and then standardizes this ranking to range from 0 to 1. This method implicitly sets the “cross over point” at the median and fits well with the distribution or our variables. For example, looking at the performance variable (5 items, each measured on a scale from 1 to 7) the median, separating “high performing” system from “low performing” ones with our method, is 5.7. This is more than the middle of our scale (i.e. 4 which indicates stagnation), but this minimum level is consistent in defining “high performing systems”Once subsets have been defined, we can turn to hypotheses testing. We can think of necessary and sufficient conditions as subset relations. For example, H1 states that those systems that are performing well is a subset of those systems which have a business KH of value or a good mastery of organizational KH. Large-N applications integrate probabilistic elements to capture the degree to which a majority of cases correspond to the statement that X is a superset of Y (quasi-necessity; X ≥ Y), or a subset of Y (quasi-sufficiency; X ≤ Y) (Ragin, 2000). The analysis of necessity starts with identifying simple conditions that are a superset of (that is: necessary for) the outcome (here: high performing system). If no simple condition (here: mastery of a KH) proves necessary, further simple conditions can be added disjunctively until necessity is obtained (Thiem, 2014). We interpret those supersets as necessary conditions that make theoretical sense                                                  Only for the variable that refers to franchising rate a different choice could be (also) consistent. For this variable, the limit between systems with “high” franchising rate and low franchising rate amount to 80% with our method. This quite high level fits well with the definition of “turnkeys” and is consequently relevant. However, some professionals or academics may see it as quite high. Changing the calibration for this variable (and using the direct method (Ragin, 2008) with anchors at 30% (minimum threshold), 70% (crossover point) and 90% (maximum threshold) does not alter our results.against the background of our hypotheses, and meet the criteria outlined below (see Schneider and Wagemann, 2012). For the analysis of sufficiency, a “truth table” is constructed. The rows of the truth table indicate all possible combinations. This enables us to attribute the cases accordingly to the truth table and identify empirically unobserved configurations (so-called logical remainders). If all or enough cases’ fuzzy set-membership in a truth table row is smaller than or equal to its membership in the outcome, then the row is identified as a sufficient configuration for the outcome. The logical minimization process then identifies the shortest possible expression depicting the configurations that imply the outcome— the solution term. This is a straightforward procedure that relies on a basic set theory: for example, A*B*C + A*B*~C (the tilde means “not”) can be reduced to A*B (Thomann et al., 2018). To evaluate our results, we use consistency and coverage measures. The values of these fit indices can range from 0 (low) to 1 (high). Consistency is the extent to which the results are in line with the statements of necessity or sufficiency. For sufficient conditions, consistency is indicated for single truth table rows (raw consistency), for single configurations of, or for the whole solution term. We ensure that a given configuration is not simultaneously sufficient for both the occurrence and the nonoccurrence of the outcome. Coverage sufficiency depicts how well the model explains the available empirical information. Raw coverage expresses how much a single configuration covers, and unique coverage indicates how much it uniquely covers. Low coverage means that the model has a limited capacity to explain the outcome. For necessary conditions, coverage expresses their relevance in terms of the condition set not                                                  This possibility is provided directly in the « fuzzy » command of STATA software. It is similar to the use of PRI (proportional reduction in inconsistency) in other study (e.g. Thomann et al., 2018).being much larger than the outcome set, and the relevance of necessity (RoN) in terms of the condition being close to a constant (all formulae in Schneider and Wagemann 2012, p. 128, 139, 235–239). RESULTS Know-how as necessary conditions to high performance To evaluate our results, we use consistency and coverage measures. The values of these fit indices can range from 0 (low) to 1 (high). Consistency expresses the extent to which the results are in line with the statements of necessity, i.e. the degree to which observations correspond to set relation. A high level of consistency is necessary to assess the statement of necessity. Following Thomann et al. (2018), we retained a level of 0.9. For necessary conditions, coverage expresses their relevance in terms of the condition set not being much larger than the outcome set. If the set of networks with high know how was much bigger than the set of performing networks (which corresponds to a low coverage), then it would be very likely that KH is a necessary conditions to performance and the relevance of this condition would be weakened. Therefore, we must check that the coverage is not too low. Thomann et al. (2018) used a minimum coverage threshold of 0.6. Another information is important to assess the relevance of the KH as necessary conditions: the relation in size between the sets of “high” KH networks and the set of “low” KH networks. If the set of networks with high level of KH is much bigger than those with low level of KH, then it is very easy for networks with high level of KH to be a superset of whatever the outcome set consists of. We check this by computing the relevance of necessity (RoN) (see Schneider and Wagemann, 2012), and by plotting high performing systems vs systems with high level of KH, showing that neither are skewed toward high membership (Figure 2).  The level of consistency of 0.9 is attained for the set of the three KH (cohesion and/or control KH at the organizational level, or business KH) (Table 3). The coverage ratio (0.668) is not too low, and the relevance of necessity (equals to 1 its maximum) or the graphs (see Figure 2) show no skewness in the distributions, which confirm that this condition of necessity is relevant. Figure 2. Plots of the membership in the outcome (“highly performing systems”) and the membership in the different configurations of mastering of KH Legend: These graphs show that there is not sharp skewness in the distribution of KH toward high membership, whatever the membership in high performing systems, which supports the relevance of the condition of necessity regarding these KH. Table 3. Analyses of necessity Conditions Consistency Coverage Relevance of Necessity Good mastering of (cohesion or control or business) KH:  (COHE + CONT + BUSI) 0.901 0.668 Good mastering of (control or business) KH:  (CONT + BUSI) 0.854 0.685 Good mastering of (cohesion or business) KH (COHE + BUSI) 0.868 0.695 Good mastering of (control or cohesion) KH (CONT + COHE) 0.823 0.685 H1 is thus corroborated: the set of the three KH (cohesion, control, business) constitutes a necessary condition to high performance. Further, the results show that the set has to include these three KH to reach the consistency threshold. The three KH taken altogether constitute a minimum set that assesses the statement of necessity in relation to performance in franchise systems.  Capabilities as quasi-sufficient conditions to high performance We also used consistency and coverage measures to evaluate sufficiency. For sufficient conditions, consistency is indicated for single truth table rows (raw consistency), for single configurations or for the whole solution term. There is no fixed anchor to set the raw consistency threshold, but 0.75 is considered a minimum (Schneider and Wagemann, 2012; Thomann et al., 2018). We set a first threshold above this minimum, at 0.85 and also run our model with a threshold at 0.80. Coverage sufficiency depicts how well the model explains the available empirical information. Raw coverage expresses how much a single configuration covers, and unique coverage indicates how much it uniquely covers. Low coverage means that the model has a limited capacity to explain the outcome. The results can be presented in three modes or solution types. The “complexity” or “conservative” solution considers that all high performing configurations, which are not (or too weakly) present in our data (the so-called “logical remainders”), should not be taken in the set of high performing configurations before the minimization process. At the opposite, the “parsimonious” solution considers that all the high performing configurations, whether they are actually in our data or not, have to be taken in the minimization process. The “intermediate” solution is in between these two modes. In this mode, the researcher chooses which “logical remainder” configurations are theoretically non-problematic and plausible, and only those logical remainders enter the final (reduced) solution. Most prior work considered that the intermediate solution was superior to the two other solution types (Schneider and Wagemann, 2012; Thiem, 2019). But as Baumgartner and Thiem (2017) have shown, the conservative (or complexity) solution and the intermediate solution frequently committed causal fallacies of varying magnitude by presenting inferences that violated the very causal structure QCA was supposed to recover from a set of data. The parsimonious solution type is not affected by these causal fallacies. Thiem (2019) explained this counterintuitive result, and showed how the incriminated (conservative and intermediate) solutions supplement empirical data with matching artificial data. Considering this result, and considering that our “logical remainders” do not present a priori any problem from a theoretical point of view, we choose to present the parsimonious solution types. H2 states that a good mastering of control KH is a quasi-sufficient condition in a context of high franchising rate (or “turnkey systems”). In other words, some high performing configurations should exhibit the conjunctions of a good mastering of control KH when the franchising rate is high.  19 solutions entered as true and 16 solutions treated as do not cares (dnt). The solution considered as true or dnt (i.e retained as high performing) before the reduction process must simultaneously: i) Show a consistency level in relation to performance significantly higher (at the 10% confidence level) than 0.85 and ii) a consistency level in relation to performance that is significantly higher (at the same confidence level) than the consistency for low performance. Table 4. Parsimonious solution of high performance model A black circle represents the presence of a condition, a white circle represents the absence of a condition, and an empty cell indicates an irrelevant condition. In Table 4, the parsimonious solution shows only 4 configurations, which lead to high performance. Overall this solution shows a high consistency, and a coverage of 0.612, which indicates that these solutions cover more than 60% of the high performing configurations. Only configuration 1 includes a high franchising rate as one of its conditions. All other high performing configurations include « Not having a high franchising rate » as an INUS condition to performance. The high performing configuration with high franchising rate also includes a good mastering of control. This Configurations Overall : Coverage 0.612 Solution consistency 0.883 Franchising rate  (FRAN) Control KH (CONT)  Cohesion KH (COHE) Business KH (BUSI) Adaptive CD (ADAP) Sensing CD (SENS) Coverage (uniq) 0.106 0.091 0.018 0.035 Coverage (raw) 0.356 0.429 0.318 0.303 Solution consistency 0.905 1.000 0.887 0.879 supports H2: the control is a quasi-sufficient (INUS) condition of high performance when the franchising rate is high. To achieve a high performance with high franchising rate, the franchisor must not only have a good mastering of control, but also have a good mastering of the other KH (cohesion, business) and some dynamic (adaptive) capabilities as well. The conditions for a system with a high franchising rate to be efficient are therefore very tight. Nevertheless, this configuration shows a significant unique coverage (0.106, the highest among the different high performing configurations), and a moderate raw coverage (0.356). We can conclude that achieving high performance with a high franchising rate necessitates more than just mastering control in the system. But these demanding conditions are met by a significant number of franchisors among the high performing ones.  H2 receives some support, but the supports for H3 are more mixed. H3 states that sensing or adaptive DC are, in conjunction with KH, INUS conditions to high performance. We should observe the conjunction of adaptive or sensing DC with at least one KH in the high performing systems. Actually, only configuration 1 offers a clear support to H3. In this configuration, not only the franchisor has to master the main KH, but he/she must also possess dynamic adaptive capabilities. In other high performing configurations —which all include a “low” franchising rate— the mastering of a KH (configurations 2 and 3, business KH) is not necessarily associated with having DC. In configuration 2 an INUS condition of high performance is, on the contrary, NOT to develop adaptive capabilities. In configuration 3, developing DC is irrelevant. The configuration 4 includes the adaptive capabilities as an INUS condition, but this is not associated with a condition regarding the mastering of KH. In this configuration, the mastering of KH is irrelevant (business, control KH), or the system must NOT invest in mastering a KH (cohesion). Table 5 crosses the sets of hypothesized and not hypothesized configurations, with the set of detected solutions (also in Table 4) and not detected (all other possible configurations). H3 is stated as (CONT + COHE + BUSI) * (ADAP + SENS)  PERF (for the computation of intersection between the different (theorized and detected) solutions, see Schneider and Wagemann (2012, p. 301)). Table 5 shows how the results behave with respect to H3. The upper left quadrant shows those configurations that were both hypothesized and observed as high performing (with a set-membership > 0.5). The lower left quadrant displays those configurations that were not expected, but observed empirically, revealing additional explanations for high performance. The upper right quadrant refers to configurations that were expected but not observed in the solution. The lower right quadrant displays those configurations that are neither hypothesized nor covered by the solution. The upper left quadrant crosses our hypothesized results with the detected solution. It indicates that adaptive DC can, in conjunction with KH, be INUS conditions of performance. Adaptive capabilities can lead to performance when franchising rate is high, associated with a good mastering of the 3 know how (solution: ADAP * (F * CONT * COHE * BUSI)). We recognize here the configuration 1. Less obvious because it doesn’t appear as such in the detected solutions but still consistent with these solutions: adaptive capabilities can also be present in high performing configurations with a low franchising rate. In that case, it must be associated with a good mastering of control and business KH, but a not a high level of cohesion KH (solution: F * COHE * (CONT + BUSI)). Finally, sensing capabilities can also incorporate performing configuration, but only in contexts with low franchising rate, a strong business KH, but no mastering in adaptive dynamic capability and cohesion KH (solution SENS * (BUSI * F * ADAP + COHE)). These results emphasize the importance of the business KH in these high performing configurations. Based on Schneider and Wagemann (2012, p. 302), in each quadrant we indicated the consistency and coverage scores of the solutions as sufficient conditions for performance (PERF) and nonperformance (PERF) respectively. In this upper left quadrant, the solutions are still highly consistent with the statement of sufficiency (consistency of 0.885) regarding performance, further they show a coverage (0.567) that is close to the coverage of all the parsimonious solution (0.612). A little more than 56% of the performing configurations are predicted by theory (H3) and covered by empirics. These figures offer some support to H3, and we conclude that DC are INUS conditions to performance, but only in relationship with other (also INUS) conditions. In other words, the DC and KH interact to deliver performance (H3) only in some specific contexts.  The upper right quadrant pictures configurations hypothesized but not detected in solutions. Much (6) of these configurations include sensing capabilities. Sensing capabilities are less than expected in the recipes for success. Two configurations also include adaptive capabilities associated with cohesion KH in this quadrant.   The lower left quadrant is where empirical findings overlap with those cases not expected by theory. These cases refer (at least partially) to configurations 2 and 4 in Table 4. Indeed, contrary to H3, under specific circumstances, some configurations deliver high performance based only on the business KH or on adaptive DC and without any interaction between KH and DC. Hence, having a business KH of value, associated with low franchising rate, weak DC and cohesion KH (whatever the mastering of control KH) lead to high performance. As noted by Schneider and Wagemann (2012, p. 302), these configurations (not hypothesized but present in empirical findings) identify cases that suggest the direction in which theoretical expectations should be extended. However, this holds only for cases that also lead to high performance. From this respect, we notice that the coverage of these solutions in relation to high performance is quite weak (0.363). Hence, they cover quite few of the high performing configurations. Further, we already offered some explanations to these cases. Our theoretical framework portrays configurations where KH are present but DC absent as possible but not sustainable regarding high performance (on the long term) (solution: ADAP * SENS * F * BUSI *COHE). We also mentioned that, in our framework, configurations based on DC but that do not associate at least one of the KH may appear. These DC might then apply to other KH, not included on our study. Here, a configuration show that adaptive capability can lead to performance under the condition that the franchisor do not develop any of the KH included in this study (solution: CONT * BUSI * COHE * ADAP), although these KH can be considered as necessary condition to performance. This may indicate that, in some cases, adaptive capabilities apply to KH other than control, cohesion or business KH to deliver performance. But as indicated by the low level of coverage of this solution, these cases remain rare. Finally, the lower right quadrant shows cases not expected by the theory and not detected in empirics as well. It refers to overlooked cases regarding H3. These configurations exhibit no DC at all, or they may include sensing DC but no mastering of any KH. The fact that the configurations in this quadrant that lead to high performance exhibit a quite high coverage (0.591) and a high consistency (1) simply indicates that H3 and the solutions detected in Table 4 do not cover all the high performing systems. But H3 does not pretend to be a general theory of high performing systems, it rather intends to offer a partial explanation deduced from a more general theory. Table 5.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In this study, we characterized two franchisor’s organizational KH -control, cohesion- and local KH as a set of conditions necessary for high performance in franchise systems. However, this result should not be misinterpreted. It states that a study that would take into account only one of these KH to explain performance, contingently or not, would explain the performance of only one part of the systems. But this result is not exclusive of other approaches or outcomes; in particular, it does not rule out the possibility that other conditions, including sets of other KH, may also form sets of conditions necessary for high performance. Above all, our analysis leads us to distinguish between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for high performance in franchise systems. While the KH taken into account in this study do indeed together constitute necessary conditions, they can only constitute sufficient conditions in association with other conditions. In this light, our analysis leads us to predict that, in combination with a high franchising rate, control KH should be a sufficient condition of high performance. Our results support this prediction. Simultaneously, they show that additional conditions are required, and that the configurations concerned represent at best a little more than 35% of the configurations that lead to high performance. We also predict that KH should lead to high performance in association with DC. Our results show that this is the case for a significant proportion of the high performing configurations. Nevertheless, they also show that certain DC can in certain contexts, even in the absence of the KH retained in this study, lead to high performance. We interpret this result as an indication that the KH retained in this study, although identified together as a necessary condition for high performance, are not the only KH to which DC apply. We also observe configurations where DC are absent (or without incidence), and certain KH, alone or in combination, lead to high performance. Our results confirm that business KH is a cornerstone of high performance, but not systematically and independently of other conditions.   Above all, our results inform about the nature, but also the diversity and complexity of the \"franchise management capabilities\" that lead to high performance (Gillis et al., 2020). Through the lens of franchise management capabilities, our results complement (and in fact depart from) those of Gillis et al. (2020). Indeed, they show that the package of dynamic KH and capabilities that lead to high performance is not the same depending on the franchise ownership strategy (plural form vs turnkey franchisor). For turnkey franchisors, who franchise all, or almost all, the franchise management capabilities that lead to high performance combine control knowledge, cohesion and DC for adaptation. Thus, the franchise management capabilities that lead to success do not only lie in the control of the franchisees, it is also necessary to gain their adhesion and to develop adaptive capabilities. The configuration approach therefore allows us to define a set of precise conditions that lead to high performance. The lack of a link between franchise management capabilities and performance observed by Gillis et al. (2020) concerning turnkey systems may be due to their linear approach and their measurements, either aggregated or separate, of the different components of the franchise management capabilities that do not allow highlighting these conditions. Our results for plural form systems contrast sharply with those of turnkey systems and are a priori less informative: franchise management capabilities either do not appear in the high-performance configurations or under a condition of absence (only business KH then appears positively), or only dynamic adaptation capabilities appear. Further studies are required to determine which (other) capabilities are to be considered in defining the conditions of high performance. However, our results already partially point the way. We show that control, cohesion and business KH are the necessary conditions for high performance. It is therefore possible to start from these conditions, and to think about other conditions, linked to capabilities or to the context of the franchise systems, which enable to define the conditions of high performance more precisely. This study’s results contain three limitations that should guide future research. First, the cross-sectional design of this study allowed to address the issue of complex interdependencies among dynamic capabilities, know-how and franchise ownership conditions but it did not allow us to examine these complex interdependencies over time. We measured the constructs at one point in time. However, the integration of time is important if not crucial in the study of dynamic capabilities (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009). This complex and dynamic area of research requires rich and diverse research methods (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) to increase our understanding of dynamic capabilities within franchise systems and provide more insights into their practice. In particular, longitudinal studies should be undertaken to explore the long-term effects of dynamic capabilities. A longitudinal study design may then depict the dynamics of change in dynamic capabilities. Second, we used self-reported data. Although efforts were made to ensure data quality, the potential of survey biases cannot be excluded.  The respondents’ perceptions might not coincide with objective reality. Third, the sample was drawn from across several sectors, which increases the scope of our results; however, significant differences may be hidden.  \n",

Abstract Australia’s policy makers have worked since 1993 to curb unconscionable conduct in franchise relationships. One area that remains unyielding is franchise marketing funds. Franchise relationships are primarily regulated by contracts. The contracts are drafted to benefit franchisors, and in many relationships, franchisees are required make payments to marketing funds, controlled by franchisors. The franchisee’s understanding when making these payments is that the funds will be used for the benefit of their own franchise. However, the failure to require franchisors to hold marketing funds in trust and has seen their being used to boost franchisors’ profits and even fund a franchisor’s racing car. For a range of reasons, franchisors resist recommendations to protect marketing funds by requiring they be held in trust. Recently, the Australian government’s Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme has gained access to marketing funds to pay an insolvent franchisor’s employees. This article provides evidence of the scale of opportunism concerning marketing funds, identifies the current laws that stall effective regulation of these funds, and proposes solutions. Key words: contract, consumer protection, insolvency law, franchise marketing funds Franchise marketing funds and the law: the unscrupulous franchisor’s piggy bank.  Introduction Navigating ‘conflicts [of interest] is the primary challenge’ of franchising. The nature and content of franchise agreements facilitate ‘[a]n unrestricted exercise of control by the franchisor [that] will favour the franchisor’s interests over the franchisee’s and create an equally significant problem for the franchisee: the risk of opportunism’.  Potentially intractable conflicts of interest, are cemented into the franchise contract. They capitalise on franchisee over-optimism and enable franchisors to behave unconscionably.   The franchise marketing fund is particularly problematic. Answers to questions like who contributes to it, how and when funds are spent, what they are spent on, how the expenditure is accounted for and who makes the brand’s marketing decisions should be transparent. Often this is not the case. One justification may be that ‘[i]n some circumstances a franchisor’s decision to require increased advertising by franchisees … will reflect a legitimate exercise of franchisor control to overcome free-riding. But in other circumstances, it will reflect only opportunism’.Imagine being Mr and Mrs Scaf, a franchisee of the now failed Aussie Farmers Direct (AFD), who claimed, in relation to use of AFD’s $789,391 marketing fund: (1) AFD marketing tools which we were promised when we purchased the franchise (but which were never outlined in our Franchise Agreement) were simply removed at will ... (2) … The Franchise Agreement was limited in its content .... The Franchisor themselves had no obligations around … the website customers ordered through or the marketing tools they chose to use our funds on.

(3) Our marketing fund statements were impossible to make sense of …, if we even saw the statement at all.The AFD franchisee touches on the challenges posed by franchise agreements that document a relationship where ‘the [intellectual] property rights of the franchisor are often a primary interest of the contract’. It also highlights the failure of Australia’s legislation, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (‘CCA’), the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’), the Franchising Code of Conduct (‘the Code’) and to a lesser extent the ASIC Act (because it applies to fewer franchise offerings) to prevent opportunistic misuse of marketing fund by franchisors. The CCA, ACL and the Code are administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’) and the ASIC Act is administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’).  It is not just AFD that revealed weakness in contract and consumer protection law. Franchisees in the Croissant Express franchise submitted to the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, InquiryPJC’):  $420,000.00 [was] taken for the Point of Sale [POS] system when it is supposed to be used to market our businesses - no marketing of any significance done except in store posters to existing customers. … Requests for the financials that make up the Audits - declined  We approached the ACCC and found the franchisor to be deceptive to the ACCC - told them that the POS was actually a marketing tool with [the franchisor] suppling [products and programs] all of which we never received however; the marketing fund had paid for. This is a Point of Sale, and not a marketing tool, as they claim.

Kyle Hudspeth, PJC submission 34; Dean Stewart PJC submission 145. As David Lewellyn writes, ‘a moral hazard may emerge whereby consumers perceive there to be an “implicit contract” between themselves and the regulatory agency’. The Croissant Express submission suggests that the franchisee believed the ACCC as regulator would not accept the franchisor’s explanation. That optimism was misplaced. The Scafs’ AFD submission also hints at problems looming for AFD in another area of law, insolvency.  The financial auditors statement that Franchisors can get away with including currently is insufficient and even misleading – after all, our Franchisor was still approving sales of franchises in 2018, signing the Duty of Disclosure document which stated they were able to pay their debts for the next twelve months, while simultaneously following a process to investigate insolvency optionsHere, again, the franchisees’ interest in the marketing fund were shown to be vulnerable, revealing a conflict of interest between the franchisor’s administrator and the government. The potential for this conflict had been foreshadowed in the Wein Review in the context of a conflict between the interests of the franchisor’s unsecured creditors, and its franchisees.The above examples are but three extracts from franchisee submissions to the 2018 Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct. These insights highlight one of the horrifying blind spots of regulation of the franchise relationship in Australia. In this paper the categorisation of franchise marketing funds is examined through the lenses of contract law, consumer protection policy and insolvency law. Franchisors’ objections to a suggestion that they hold marketing funds in trust is challenged. How courts have resolved conflicts of interest concerning franchise marketing funds is addressed and solutions are proposed.

Alan Wein, Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, 30 April 2013.  The purpose of marketing funds in a franchised business Brand reputation and goodwill is at the core of the franchise business model. Central to the development of any brand is the way its products/ services are advertised and perceived by consumers. An effective and memorable advertising campaign has the ability to bolster a brand’s reputation and stay with consumers long-after the commercials have stopped airing or the newspapers have been thrown out. One example, the McDonald’s ‘I’m lovin’ it’ slogan has cemented its place in popular culture references since the 2006.  As Madden surmises ‘the use of, and association with, a trademark, in conjunction with a specific and confidential business methodology, is what gives a franchise system its value.’It is unsurprising then that almost all franchisors require franchisees to make payments into central marketing funds that are intended to be used for the purposes of enhancing and building the franchise’s reputation. The basis behind such an approach is that franchisees can pool their resources, leverage the economies of scale, and create campaigns that will be of benefit for the whole system.   In franchise networks, roles are allocated between the franchisor and its franchisees. It typically falls to the franchisor to collect, administer the marketing fund and to make the marketing decisions. The franchisees must implement them. Contract, consumer protection and insolvency The franchise agreement, as the primary regulatory instrument in a franchise relationship, sets out the franchisor’s marketing funds obligations. As franchise agreements are typically offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis, the franchisee is contractually incapable of curbing franchisor  Madden, L. S. (2019). Not Your Mama's Advertising Fund: Best Practices in the Use of Franchise System Advertising Funds. Franchise Law Journal(3), 379-399. opportunism in relation to how the funds will be spent. This can be attributed to historical ways of viewing a contract.  Classical contract doctrine claims to look only to the “four corners of the document” in identifying the content of the contractual relationship between the parties. Doing so in the franchise context would define a relationship almost exclusively in terms of the franchisor’s interest in protecting its trademark and the broad range of control that it assumes to pursue that interest. As Stewart Macauley has documented, however the real life of the franchise is found not in the contract but in its operationIn a franchise relationship, much of the operational guidance is documented in operating manuals which remain unregulated and can be changed at will by franchisors. This flexibility is necessary as it enables franchise systems to adapt to changing trading environments, but it creates an opportunity for franchisor opportunism. Most franchise relationships are intended to last for many years and are expected to adapt as markets evolve. To expect a static document to cater for all future contingencies is unrealistic. In franchising ‘[t]he contract supplies starting points: the frequency of payments, … and advertising responsibilities. It also supplies boundaries’. Beyond and within the boundaries the franchise agreement is incomplete. As Hadfield observed, ‘… the incompleteness … consists in either the absence or the intense ambiguity of these starting points and boundaries: [for example] How expensive can promotions be?’ For Hadfield, ‘franchisor and franchisee enter into a “franchise relationship” in reliance on commonly understood features of that relationship which fill in the gaps of the written contract and create an understanding of the full range of commitments involved’. The franchisor, being the repeat player, is always in the stronger position. As Issacharof notes,  ‘the relation between a repeat-play mass firm and individual consumers is more likely to give rise to disparities in bargaining power, and to opportunism on  Hadfield, 956 and 957.  Hadfield, 957  Hadfield, 957  Hadfield, 957 the part of the repeat player’. The use, or misuse, of marketing funds is a prime example of this opportunism within the franchise relationship.  On executing the franchise agreement, a franchisee allocates control over the marketing fund to the franchisor. As Hadfield has noted, ‘Franchisors can abuse the relationship most directly through the manipulation of the price or quantity of products or services sold to the franchisee’. These services can include items like researching and preparing marketing programs. She continues that  Observers note that it is “tempting for franchise companies to use these advertising dollars to boost their profit margins”. Many franchisees complain that “they do not receive advertising support commensurate with their payment of advertising fees”A second problem is protection of franchisees as business consumers. ‘… although franchising arrangements have traditionally been creatures of contract, they have become increasingly regulated.’ Pre contract disclosure, dispute resolution and some other aspects of franchise regulation are implemented in recognition that ‘consumer protection is a necessary part of a functioning market and the government has some responsibility to act when markets fail.’Instances of franchisors misleading or behaving unconscionably in relation to marketing funds are recounted in Parliamentary inquiries and complaints to the ACCC. They identify franchisors’ failure to adhere to the CCA and/ or the Code, and abuse of the franchise marketing funds by franchisors. Llewellyn suggests that their belief in regulatory protection may cause some people to underestimate the risks around their consumption of particular 18 Samuel Issacharof,  ‘Disclosure, Agents, and Consumer Protection’ Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics(167) 1, 28th International Seminar on the New Institutional Economics — Business-to-Consumer Transactions (March 2011), pp. 56-71 Hadfield, 967.  Hadfield, 968.  Hadfield, 938.  C. Leigh Anderson, Muel Kiel, ‘Consumer Protection Models and Theories’, Evans Policy Analysis Report Technical Report #387, April 4, 2019 accessed at https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/epar_uw_387_consumer-protection-20190404_0.pdf goods, and services, especially financial products’. As shown by Benoliel et al, many franchisees are unrealistically over-optimistic.The third challenge facing franchisees arises if their franchisor becomes insolvent. Franchisees are not recognised under the Corporations Act as stakeholders with rights in the franchisor’s insolvency. Franchisees have invested significant sunk costs in their business, which cannot be recovered from an insolvent franchisor. The franchisees do not see the insolvency coming in the same way as unpaid employees or late-paid trade creditors may do, so they have rarely taken any proactive action to protect their rights and assets.  Let us now turn to explore how the franchisees’ rights to do anything beyond paying money into the franchisor’s marketing fund plays out in the context of contract law, consumer protection and insolvency policy.  Contract law Hadfield noted that ‘… franchise relationships are too complex to reduce to precise statutory terms, [so] the heart of franchising’s legal structure is still contract’. She observed that ‘… the traditional function of contract law is to enforce the private commitments reached by contracting parties in structuring their exchanges’. She further noted that ‘[t]he duty to avoid defeating the reasonable expectations of one’s contracting partners is another possible fairness justification for contract rules that control free-riding and opportunism’.  Alongside the idea of the parties’ private commitments needing to be respected is the reality that ‘[i]nequality of bargaining power exists in most areas of consumer transactions,particularly in complex products such as financial service transactions where standard-term contracts are the norm and Llewellyn, D.T. (1995). ‘Consumer protection in retail investment services: Protection against what?’ Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance 3(1), 43-54 at 52. https://doi.org/10.1108/eb024826. Cited in C.

Hadfield, 939.  Hadfield, 954- 955.   Hadfield, 953. are encouraged by the development of large enterprises involved in mass marketing’. The same could be said of franchise agreements.  The disadvantages of standard-form contracts have been summarised by Professor Hondius as follows:  a)  A consumer will usually not review standard contract terms …; b)  The length and typography of the full text of general conditions does not invite a consumer to read the small print; c)  A consumer will often not grasp the full meaning of the text of general conditions; d)  If the consumer grasps the full meaning of the text of general conditions, they may believe that the event mentioned with will not take place, nor will the supplier invoke the terms in particular cases; e)  A consumer may be under the false impression that the contract terms have been officially endorsed or are in compliance with the law; and f)  A consumer will generally not succeed in altering the contract terms nor will the agent or employee of the supplier have the authority to do so.Examples of Hondius’ observations abound in franchise relationships. Regulators lament that many franchisees do not read their contracts. They trust the franchisor. According to American franchise lawyer Richard Solomon:  The materials provided for you have the “look” of authenticity. The language used is the same for the really bona fide business investment opportunity as it is for the fraudulent opportunity. In both you see references to belonging to a family. You see promises of “support”. You see reassurances of “proven systems”. You see representations of economic power, as in the instance of group purchasing. These are probably all the positive attributes of organizations with which you have previously been affiliated, and they make you feel comfortableThe length of a package of franchise documents including disclosure can easily reach 300 pages. The prospective franchisee’s eyes will glaze over early in the read. Much of the language is unfamiliar legalese and as Richard Solomon poignantly acknowledged ‘Just as you would not have stood up in a meeting in your previous employment and demanded of the chief  UNCTAD, Consumer Policy Manual, 2008.UNCTAD, Consumer Policy Manual, 2008. Richard Solomon, What You Learned In “Charm School” Will Not Work in Franchise Investment Due Diligence, post in Bluemaumau.org, December 27th, 2007. executive that he prove the truth of what he has stated, you wouldn’t think of doing so here.’Compounding this, as already noted, franchisees are optimistically biased.  As Thomas J observed in Bobox the New Zealand case concerning a supplier and a distributor, ‘[t]he sheer commercial absurdity of this lopsided bargain prompts the question as to how it could have come about’. Similarly in franchising, the one-sided nature of the franchise agreement means that the vast majority of obligations and commitments are made by the franchisee, including the obligation to contribute to the franchise marketing fund. Few franchisors will specifically outline firm obligations with regard to the nature, extent, and quality of advertising or the ways in which the marketing fund will be used. While the roles and responsibilities of each party are laid out in the franchise agreement, the very nature of a long-term agreement (anywhere from five to twenty years) means that it is near impossible to contractually encompass the idiosyncrasies of the future relationship within the confines of the original agreement. As such, franchise agreements are, by necessity, left vague and open to interpretation. As Hadfield identifies:  Rather than spelling out every decision ex ante, [the franchise contract] designs a decision-making structure and assigns to the franchisor responsibility for responding to market conditions … and to the franchisee responsibility for complianceBy way of example, in the context of marketing funds, Re Stay In Bed Milk & Bread Pty Ltd (In Liq) (‘Stay In Bed’) Randall AsJ acknowledged ‘[t]he Franchise Agreement is silent on what happens with the Marketing Fund in the event that SIBMB stops trading’. In this example, the Stay In Bed Milk & Bread (SIBMB) franchisee  was required to make payments into the marketing levy amounting to 5% of Gross Delivery Fees plus GST. In  Richard Solomon, What You Learned In “Charm School” Will Not Work in Franchise Investment Due Diligence, post in Bluemaumau.org, December 27th, 2007.

To illustrate this, the franchisees from 123 Michel’s Patisserie locations agree to contribute ‘the greater of 3% of their gross sales or $200 per week (plus GST)’ to the fund, plus an initial marketing activity fee of $3,000. They also acknowledge that the franchisor may elect to contribute, with no obligation. The fund, estimated at accumulating funds at the rate of $1,407,120 per annum (including GST) plus the sums of $3,000 for each new franchisee, is controlled by the franchisor. According to the franchise agreement, the scope of activities that the money can be spent on includes, but is not limited to: (a)  research and development of or in relation to the Intellectual Property (including, but not limited to, the Franchisor’s Business Name, the Names and Marks, the System, the [franchise brand’s] Image and the Products);  (b)  research, development, identification, assessment, evaluation and or analysis of products (including the Products), goods and or services marketed or used, or to be marketed or used, by the Franchisor or its Affiliates and or offered or to be offered, or proposed to be offered, for sale from [franchise brand’s] Shops or by [franchise brand] franchisees, regardless of whether those products, goods or services are ultimately used commercially or otherwise, together with the supply or distribution, or proposed supply or distribution, of the same amongst the network of [franchise brand] Shops or [franchise brand] franchisees;   Franchise agreement clause 4.1(c).

The language used favours the franchisor and their rights above those of the franchisees. Specifically, in sub clause (d) above the needs and wants of the franchisee are ranked fifth, not only behind those of the franchisor, but also the brand’s affiliates and external stakeholders.  Other terms used throughout this section of the franchise agreement, that should send alarm bells to prospective franchisees, courts  and the regulator, include ‘franchisor’s absolute discretion’and ‘as determined by the Franchisor, in any medium whatsoever’. It is abundantly clear that franchisees have little, if any, say into how the marketing fund is to be spent in this franchise, nor is it certain that the money will be or has to be used to the franchisees benefit. Furthermore, the fund is audited annually by one of Australia’s largest accounting firms, but the audit report provided as part of the disclosure combines all six of the parent company’s franchised brands together, so that no franchisee is provided with information that is unique to their franchise nor an overview of how the fund was used to the benefit of their business. Statutory consumer protection According to the United Nations,  Consumer protection addresses disparities found in the consumer-supplier relationship, which include bargaining power, knowledge, and resources. State intervention is premised to provide consumer protection on a number of grounds, including economic efficiency.Australian law provides notional consumer protection for franchisees through legislation that sanctions unconscionable conduct, misleading and deceptive conduct, unfair contract terms and breaches of the Franchising Code of Conduct, the CCA and its Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’) Volume. Accessing that protection can be prohibitively expensive, slow, risky and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Manual on Consumer Protection, (2016) 15.daunting for franchisees. To many people reading through the above excerpt on marketing funds from the Michel’s Patisserie franchise agreement, it would be clear that this section of the agreement suggests the franchisor engaging in unconscionable or misleading and deceptive or false conduct. The terms have the capacity to become unfair contract terms depending on the business practices of the franchisor. Misleading, deceptive, false or unconscionable conduct Sections 18, 21, 29 and 37 of the ACL prohibit parties from engaging in conduct that is misleading, deceptive, false and or unconscionable. There have been a number of recent actions by the regulator (the ACCC) against franchisors for behaving in a way that breaches these sections of ACL.  Specific cases include Ultra Tune and, most recently, the Retail Good Group (RFG). Proceedings inthe latterwere filed in the Federal Court of Australia on 15 December 2020 alleging that RFG, as the listed holding company of the companies that operate several food-related franchised brands, had falsely misled franchisees in breach of ss 37(2), 29(1)(g) and 18(1) of the ACL and clause 6 of the Code. These breaches added up to RFG acting unconscionably in breach of s 21(1) of the ACL and s 51ACB of the CCA. A key focus of the litigation is the use (or misuse) of marketing funds.  The current regulatory requirements Following the Wein Review in 2013 the then Minister for Small Business, Bruce Bilson, announced that through amendments to the Code the Government would:  Introduce greater transparency for the way in which marketing funds are used and accounted for. This will include requiring additional disclosure on the types of expenses marketing funds are being used for;  giving franchisees the option to vote for an annual audit of the marketing fund; and  requiring franchisors to keep marketing funds in a separate account to the rest of their moniesAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12  The Hon Bruce Bilson, Minister for Small Business, The Future of Franchising, April 2014. This takes us to the current position where there are three requirements in the Code pertaining to marketing funds; Clauses 15 and 31 of the Code, and Item 15 of the Disclosure Document. They stipulate: Cl. 15: Copy of financial statements (1) If a franchise agreement provides that a franchisee must pay money to a marketing or other cooperative fund, the franchisor must: (a) within 4 months after the end of the last financial year, prepare an annual financial statement detailing all of the fund’s receipts and expenses for the last financial year; and (b) ensure that the statement includes sufficient detail of the fund’s receipts and expenses so as to give meaningful information about: (i) sources of income; and (ii) items of expenditure, particularly with respect to advertising and marketing expenditure; and (c) have the statement audited by a registered company auditor within 4 months after the end of the financial year to which it relates; and (d) give to the franchisee: (i) a copy of the statement, within 30 days of preparing the statement; and (ii) a copy of the auditor’s report, if such a report is required, within 30 days of preparing the report. Civil penalty: 300 penalty units [$54,000]. (2) A franchisor does not have to comply with paragraph (1)(c) in respect of a financial year if: (a) 75% of the franchisor’s franchisees in Australia, who contribute to the fund, have voted to agree that the franchisor does not have to comply with the paragraph in respect of the financial year; and (b) that agreement is made within 3 months after the end of the financial year. (3) If a franchise agreement provides that a franchisee must pay money to a marketing or other cooperative fund, the reasonable costs of administering and auditing the fund must be paid from the fund. Cl. 31 Marketing and advertising fees (1)  A franchisor must maintain a separate bank account for marketing fees and advertising fees contributed by franchisees. (2)  If a franchisor operates one or more units of a franchised business, the franchisor must pay marketing fees and advertising fees on behalf of each unit on the same basis as other franchisees. (3)  Despite any terms of a franchise agreement, marketing fees or advertising fees may only be used to:                      (a)  meet expenses that:  (i)  have been disclosed to franchisees under paragraph 15.1(f) of the disclosure document; or                              (ii)  are legitimate marketing or advertising expenses; or                             (iii)  have been agreed to by a majority of franchisees; or                      (b)  pay the reasonable costs of administering and auditing a marketing fund. Prior to signing a franchise agreement, a franchisor provides a disclosure document. Item 15 of the Disclosure Document requires the franchisor to provide information about its marketing or other cooperative funds that complies with the following: 15.1 For each marketing or other cooperative fund, controlled or administered by or for the franchisor, to which the franchisee may be required to contribute, the following details: (a)  the kinds of persons who contribute to the fund (for example, franchisee, franchisor, outside supplier); (b)  how much the franchisee must contribute to the fund and whether other franchisees must contribute at a different rate; (c)  who controls or administers the fund; (d)  whether the fund is audited and, if so, by whom and when; (e)  how the fund’s financial statements can be inspected by franchisees; (f)  the kinds of expense for which the fund may be used; (g)  the fund’s expenses for the last financial year, including the percentage spent on production, advertising, administration and other stated expenses; (h)  whether the franchisor or its associates supply goods or services for which the fund pays and, if so, details of the goods or services; (i)  whether the franchisor must spend part of the fund on marketing, advertising or promoting the franchisee’s business. Compliance with the above requirements should have been sufficient for franchise marketing funds to be operated for the purpose of marketing for the benefit of those whose contributions made up the fund. However, a number of franchise agreements, disclosure documents and submissions to the 2018 PJC inquiry revealed a different approach by some franchisors. The question raised here is how and why franchisors are able to skirt the law and get away with not complying with their disclosure requirements. The answer can be found in the most long-standing issue facing the franchise relationship, that of the inherent imbalance of power and control.  Insolvency law An entity becoming insolvent is a game-changer in terms of the applicable legislation and rights of stakeholders.  The usual laws of contract and consumer protection are replaced by the rights of creditors. In franchisor insolvency the franchisees are an externality and as a result, a range of different franchise stakeholders may be unjustly enriched by the marketing fund when remaining assets are distributed. This was demonstrated in an unexpected way in the Aussie Farmers Direct (AFD) example.   The franchisor’s liquidators. In theory a well-coordinated group of franchisees could make out a claim in quasi-contractagainst the administrator or liquidator, for unjust enrichment. This has not been tested in the context of insolvency in Australian courts. It depends firstly on the court granting consent to franchisees to embark on litigation against the administrator or liquidator or against the directors or solvent related entities of the failed franchisor.   An unjust enrichment action could be considered by franchisees that recently paid a franchise fee but derived very little benefit prior to the franchisor’s failure. The pool of money available to the liquidator to pay creditors is artificially expanded by both the franchise fee and the pool of funds in the franchisor-controlled marketing fund; thus, the liquidator is ‘unjustly enriched’. So, if liquidators and the franchisor’s secured and unsecured creditors and franchisor’s employees are benefitting from the money franchisees have paid into the marketing fund of an insolvent franchisor what can be done to address franchisees’ reasonable expectations? This is discussed in more detail later.Response of the courts According to Hadfield ‘[w]here the courts go astray … is in treating the franchisor’s interest as if it represented the entirety of the relation’. While several Australian franchise cases mention marketing funds, most are based on breach of contract claims; few concerned breaches of the marketing funds obligations in the Code.   Bruce Moore (ed), The Australian Oxford Dictionary ed, 2010) 479. ‘Quasi-contract (implied contract) a form of the equitable remedy of restitution to restore an innocent party to his previous position.’  Hadfield, 980. In 2007, Beech J denied a request for summary judgment in The Outdoor Furniture Specialists Pty Ltd v Liveris (TOFS). The franchisor plaintiff was joined in the action by its marketing company, TOFS Marketing Ltd. They claimed that  substantial disputes had arisen between the first plaintiff franchisor and the defendants. Among the matters in dispute were the applicable percentage rate to be applied to the calculation of marketing contributions and the question of the proper identification of the turnover to which such rate was to be applied.   An earlier mediation between the parties had resulted in them signing a Settlement Deed. It included the provision that 7.7 The Parties agree that the monies in the TOFS marketing fund for Perth will be reasonably expended during the currency of this Deed on advertising in and around Perth. Such expenditure will be in accordance with clause 15.10 of the O'Connor Franchise Agreement. However, they could not agree after that mediation how much money was involved. The franchisor asked a person at accounting firm PwC, Mr Vickers, to advise the correct sum.  He determined that an amount of $54,852.95 was payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs in respect of the marketing contributions for the period in questionWhat we can take from TOFS is that the application of moneys paid into the marketing fund by franchisees is of serious concern to franchisees, and that it may involves sizeable sums.  Although the next case is not about compliance with the Code either, it proved to be a taste of things to come for franchisors that are not explicit about how marketing funds are spent. BB Australia PtyLtd v Constanti was what Mukhtar AsJ described as ‘a quarrelsome appeal from a decision of the Magistrates’ Court concerning the payment of licence and marketing fees due by an ex-franchisee under a franchise agreement’ over the portion of the original claim that the magistrate had disallowed. In regard to the $16,168.62 sum of allegedly owing marketing fees, the court observed;    [2007] WASC 197  Para 21  [2017] VSC 114. the claim for unpaid licence fees and marketing fund contributions for $16,168.62 which the Magistrate disallowed was also the subject of a number of invoices which simply refer to marketing fee or ‘franchise-rental’ or ‘franchise-retail’ and a time period, state the amount due, and say no more. (71) the history of miscalculations elsewhere intensified the need to be satisfied that the calculations in the relevant invoices were proved to his Honour’s satisfaction.   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd[2019] FCA 12 Bromwich J considered the veracity of information provided to a range of franchisees operating Ultra Tune businesses in different states and different parts of those states.  72. For the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years, Ultra Tune was required by cl. 15 of the Franchising Code to prepare, have audited, and distribute certain annual financial statements if a franchisee was required to pay money into a marketing fund.   Having been satisfied that the franchisor (Ultra Tune) had not complied with its obligations the court considered the appropriate penalty 322. Specific deterrence looms large, as does general deterrence lest any other franchisor be tempted to conduct a franchise business in a like manner. Such conduct, by both Ultra Tune, and by others contemplating the same or similar behaviour, will only be likely to be deterred if the penalties imposed are large enough to ensure that this cannot be seen as a mere cost of doing business, or a chance worth taking, because of the greater returns to be made from franchisees, and prospective franchisees, who are not appropriately armed with the information they need to make sound business decisions, in entering into, and continuing franchise arrangements and in spending substantial sums of otherwise unchecked money on marketing funds.Quistclose trust In 2018, what Mr Wein had accepted was possible in 2014, came to pass.  Aussie Farmers Direct was Australia's first independent grocery delivery businesses to reach a national scale. They were pioneers in the grocery delivery space. Their mission resonated with millions, which lead to a strong community of people who wanted to bypass the supermarket duopoly and support Australian farmers. After 13 years of fighting the supermarket duopoly, the Aussie Farmers Direct business model ultimately became unsustainable and the company went into voluntary administration on March 6th, 2018Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12  https://www.aussiefarmers.com.au/ The voluntary administration led to liquidation. The liquidators took the issue of who owned the marketing fund to court. Following a hearing on 18 September 2018, judgment was handed down 6 months later, on 22 March 2019. The case, In the matter of Stay in Bed Milk & Bread Pty Ltd (In Liq) [2019] VSC 181 the court heard arguments by the liquidator of the franchisor known as ‘Aussie Farmers Direct’(‘AFD’). The liquidator found itself in a tussle with the Commonwealth of Australia, represented by the Australian Government Department of Jobs and Small Business (‘the Department’). The Department administers the Fair Entitlements Guarantee (‘FEG’) schemethat was set up under the Fair Entitlement Guarantee Act 2012 (Cth) to replace the former General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS). The liquidators of AFD had to determine whether the marketing fund of $789,391 could be returned to the 91 franchisees that had paid into it, or whether the Commonwealth could access it to help make up a shortfall in the amount payable to franchisor, AFD’s 259 employees who were owed $4,263,654 in outstanding entitlements.  The liquidators argued that the marketing fund was held on trust for the franchisees, or, alternatively that a Quistclose trust was formed on the insolvency of the franchisor and that as a consequence, the money in the marketing fund should be returned to the franchisees. They lost. The Department argued that no trust had been created and that the money should be an asset of the franchisor and should be available to fund the shortfall of wages and entitlements owing to the employees and payable under the FEG. They won.  The court also ordered that the costs of both parties should be paid out of the marketing fund. Without knowing what those costs amounted to, we would suggest that they cut  The franchisor would also need to be included if it had contributed to the fund. significantly into the $789,391 that would otherwise have been able to be paid back to former franchisees.   The current Federal Court action against listed franchisor Retail Food Group (ASX:RFG) was filed in December 2020 as a result of evidence provided by franchisees to the 2018 PJC inquiry. RFG’s share price dropped 24% before a brief trading halt. Shares are now trading at 7.4 cents. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Retail Food Group Limited File number NSD1333/2020 the ACCC alleges that the franchisor made false and misleading claims about the profitability of corporate stores it sold to franchisees, made ‘improper payments from marketing fund accounts and failed to properly disclose marketing expenditures to franchisees,’ behaved unconscionably and with a lack of good faith. RFG has 10 brands including those specifically identified in the pleadings: Michel’s Patisserie, Brumby’s Bakery, Donut King and Gloria Jean’s. Six weeks later there is still no mention of the pending litigation on the RFG website so prospective franchisees who do not conduct extensive due diligence could be unaware of the case. Proposed solutions The Australian franchise sector has been the subject of numerous parliamentary reviews. These resulted in the introduction of a voluntary Code of Practice in 1993, followed in 1998 by a mandatory Code of Conduct and the expansion of the unconscionable conduct provisions of the CCA to cover business to business dealings. Minor tweaks were made to the 1998 Code following further reviews of franchising in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2018 and 2020. All identified the requirement that the franchisor provide marketing leadership in some form. https://hotcopper.com.au/asx/rfg/overview/ Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Retail Food Group Limited File number NSD1333/2020. Concise Statement 15 December 2020. https://www.rfg.com.au/shareholder-center/ viewed on 4 February 2021.  These reviews resulted in the following reports: ‘Opportunity not Opportunism’ (2008), the ‘Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct’ (2013), (the Wein Report), ‘Fairness in Franchising’ (2019).  Fitzgerald, R., ‘Franchising Code of Practice’ (1993, unpublished).  In the context of reform to the way marketing funds are managed, ‘[F]ranchisors have not been among those lobbying for change or regulation’. The opaqueness of franchise marketing funds and the consequential franchisor opportunism in relation to how these funds are accounted for to franchisees, and spent were strong, recurrent themes in the most recent review by the PJC ‘Fairness in Franchising’ Report (2019). Clearly, franchise marketing funds merit closer scrutiny. Some submissions identified that franchisors are avoiding obligations with respect to marketing by structuring their marketing and advertising fund so that it does not meet the definition of a fund as set out in the Code. It was suggested that marketing funds should be kept in a separate account, such as a trust account. Apart from the clarity and administrative benefits of a separate marketing and advertising fund, one submission indicated that it is possible such an approach may provide franchisees with an explicit proprietary claim to money in the funds in the event of the franchisor's insolvency. This reiterated one of the principles the Wein Report recommended be applied to marketing funds through the Code. They were:  a franchisor should separately account for marketing and advertising costs; contributions to marketing funds from individual franchisees should be held on trust for franchisees generally, with the franchisor to have wide discretion as to how to expend the funds (subject to principle ‘e’ below);  company-owned units must be required to contribute to the marketing and advertising fund on the same basis as franchised units;  the marketing and advertising fund should only be used for expenses which are clearly disclosed to franchisees by way of the disclosure document, and which are legitimate marketing and advertising expenses;  a once yearly independent audit should be conducted on marketing funds over a certain threshold value, with no capacity for franchisees to vote against such an audit; and the results of the audit (where applicable) and other detailed information about the expenditure of marketing and advertising funds should be made available to franchisees yearly.  Hadfield, 966.  Jenny Buchan, submission to the [Wein] review p 4. Changes mooted by government: The 2019 Task Force’s Regulation Impact Statement The 2019 Task Force outlined a number of options to address transparency of marketing funds in the Regulation Impact Statement. These included:  Option 3.1.1 Status quo. Under this option, there would be no changes to the Franchising Code. Over time, additional case law could work to improve the understanding of legitimate marketing expenses. Option 3.1.2 Address inconsistency in the Franchising Code on the treatment of marketing funds and increase reporting standards. Under this option the Government would improve consistency within the Franchising Code in relation to the treatment of marketing funds, particularly clauses 15 and 31(Recommendation 6.7), introduce civil pecuniary penalties for a breach of clause 31 (Recommendation 6.8), increase the frequency and standards of reporting of marketing funds (Recommendation 6.9), require master franchisors to meet requirements of marketing funds (Recommendation 6.10), and clarify the distribution of marketing funds in the event of franchisor insolvency (Recommendation 6.12).  Option 3.1.2 (a) Improve consistency within the Franchising Code about the treatment of marketing funds, particularly clauses 15 and 31. The Franchising Code would be changed to clarify obligations with respect to marketing funds, possibly by clarifying what would be ‘meaningful information’ for the purposes of clause 15 of the Franchising Code. This could assist parties in understanding their obligations. Option 3.1.2 (b) Introduce civil pecuniary penalties for a breach of clause 31. Creating a civil pecuniary penalty for marketing fund provisions in clause 31 will deter breaches of the Franchising Code. Penalties for non-compliance may boost confidence in the operation of marketing funds.  Option 3.1.2 (c) Increase the frequency and standards of reporting of marketing funds. Franchisors are currently required to produce annual statements for the use of marketing funds. By increasing the frequency of required reporting to quarterly (Recommendation 6.9), franchisees would have access to more up to date information on the use of marketing funds than is currently required. Stakeholders have submitted that franchisees may have to bear the cost of increased reporting but may not receive an overall benefit from increased information. https://docs.employment.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/final_franchising_ris_-_11112019.pdfOption 3.1.2 (d) Require master franchisors to meet requirements of marketing funds. Improved understanding will likely arise from making the requirements consistent between clause 15 and 31 and ensuring their application to master franchisors (Recommendation 6.10).  Option 3.1.2 (e) Clarify the distribution of marketing funds in the event of franchisor insolvency. Clarifying the distribution of unspent marketing funds (Recommendation 6.12) would give provide greater transparency of the operation of marketing funds in the event of franchisor insolvency. A number of stakeholders have stated that a potential unintended consequence of increasing the administration requirements of managing marketing funds is that, should the costs and risks of administration become too onerous, franchisors may choose not to operate shared marketing funds and instead recoup marketing costs through other means (such as franchise system fees).  Option 3.1.3 Increase awareness and provide guidance around existing legal obligations. Under this option, additional efforts would be made to educate the franchising sector on their existing legal obligations on the use of marketing funds, and clearer guidance could be provided around the preparation of financial statements (Recommendation 6.11). Stakeholders have suggested that improved interpretation of the existing provisions may reduce the incidence of disputes over the use of marketing funds. Case law and court decisions which interpret ‘legitimate marketing expenses’ will provide examples and clearer guidance to the franchising sector. The government’s response was that the Code should be amended.  The Government accepts that a new approach is warranted regarding the regulation of marketing or other cooperative funds. It will amend the Code to make the administration of marketing funds more transparent and ensure that marketing and advertising funds are spent on legitimate expenses related to the marketing and advertising of the franchise system.As we will see, unfortunately for the franchisees of AFD, Recommendation 8 b) that would have ring- fenced money that was paid to the franchisor for the purpose of marketing, was not adopted. The reason for deciding not to require marketing funds to be held in a trust account was stated to be that:  ‘Forward looking franchising regulation’ Commonwealth Government response to the Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, July 2013, 12.  this may result in unintended taxation consequences regarding marketing funds and may increase the compliance costs and risks in a way that is disproportionate to the benefit a trust arrangement would confer on franchiseesVeronica Taylor’s observation that ‘[p]art of the folklore of franchising is the presumed intimacy between the partiesis confirmed by the 2013 government’s optimism on the subject of the use of marketing funds; ‘[a]s a general position, the Government encourages franchisors to consult with franchisees or franchisee representatives on the use of marketing … funds’. Submissions to the 2018 Inquiry demonstrate that this hope proved to be in vain on occasion. Hold marketing funds in trust  The 2013 Wein Review recommended that marketing funds be held as trust funds. In the PJC review, when this possibility was raised, the stakeholders who prevailed argued requiring marketing funds to be formally treated as trust funds would be problematic as:  [T]he additional compliance burdens associated with keeping a trust account may deter franchisors from setting up marketing funds at all. This may deprive franchisees of the transparency provided for relating to marketing by other provisions of the Franchising Code. This could have an impact on taxation arrangements and the treatment from a taxation and accounting perspective. Some stakeholders argued this would significantly increase the legal and administrative burdens on franchisors. If marketing funds were held in trust, this could impact franchisors credit worthiness or the cost of credit for a franchisor.  The current provision states that if 75 per cent of franchisees agree no audit is required, that agreement remains in force for three years. The new requirements will mean that a franchisor will have to conduct a vote each year.   Veronica Taylor, “Continuing Transactions and Persistent Myths: Contracts in Contemporary Japan” Melbourne University Law Review (1993) 19, 352 - 398.  ‘Forward looking franchising regulation’ Commonwealth Government response to the Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, July 2013, 12.  It was concluded by the PJC that this particular recommendation is unjustified when the potential costs are considered.So, the potential costs were considered but no mention was made of potential benefits. No change was made to the characterisation of the marketing funds paid by franchisees, or franchisors.  In Fairness in Franchising 2019, the issue of marketing funds was highlighted again in Recommendation 6.12 that reads: The committee recommends that the Australian Government clarify, through legislation, the distribution of unused marketing funds in the event of the franchisor winding upIt is worth testing the reasons given for failing to require franchisors to hold marketing funds in trust. Do they hold water? What are the benefits to franchisors and to franchisees? Our analysis in the table below suggests the government’s Task Force has accepted the view of franchisors without rigorously examining their veracity. Justifications for not requiring franchisors to hold marketing levies in trust as outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014 Our analysis  Given franchisors are not required to maintain a marketing fund, the additional compliance burdens associated with keeping a trust account may deter franchisors from setting up marketing funds at all.   This may deprive franchisees of the transparency provided for relating to marketing by other provisions of the Franchising Code. True. Anecdotally the suggestion of Franchise Council of Australia is for franchisors to increase the royalty by the amount formally being the marketing fund to remain unaccountable. Most franchisors do collect fees under the heading of ‘marketing fund’ and thus must ‘maintain a separate bank account for marketing fees and advertising fees contributed by franchisees’.Compliance burdens: The submissions to the PJC, and disclosure documents in the author’s possession indicate there is little transparency currently, so this is not supported.  https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/ems/r5307_ems_33cd0e50-f6ad-4ec0-84a4-7de458c05c7e%22  Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 2014, clause 31 (a). Potential impact on taxation arrangements and the treatment from a taxation and accounting perspective.   Would significantly increase the legal and administrative burdens on franchisors. The likely impact, from a tax law and tax law compliance perspective is set out in the four points below. The Task Force could seek advice about any accounting impact from accountants. If marketing funds were held in trust, this could impact franchisors credit worthiness or the cost of credit for a franchisor. A franchisor should not be describing money tagged for marketing for the franchisees’ benefit as equity.  Firstly, the income tax law has some trouble with settling on the correct tax treatment of transactions where a payer pays money to a payee on the “understanding” (condition, requirement, expectation) the payee will use the monies for a particular purpose. The reason is the difficulty in characterising the transaction(s) and the precise legal rights of each party involved (e.g. is payee mere agent for payer in spending payer’s money, has payer’s money become property of payee). However, where the payee (the franchisor) is a trustee of the monies for the payer (the position unsuccessfully argued by the administrators in the Aussie Farmers case), the payee has not made assessable income. The difficulty is when the arrangement contains conditions that fall short of a trust (e.g. charge over monies). It comes down to a case by case situation. However, given all the circumstances surrounding the marketing fund in the Aussie Farmers case and judicial comments made throughout the case, subject to one potential qualification, the franchisors will have made assessable income on those facts. The main reasons are that (a) the money is either the proceeds of its business or a receipt for services (arranging marketing of franchise system for part benefit of franchisee) or a return from letting the franchise use its system, and more importantly and (b) the franchisor became the beneficial owner of the monies (e.g. no trust) because while there was an expected use, the franchisor had wide discretion in its use. The one potential qualification is that because the services of arranging the marketing occur over time (after payment in by franchisees), the tax law may defer assessable income recognition by franchisor over the time it is arranging those services.  Secondly, assuming the potential qualification does not apply, based on just the above, in terms of income tax for the franchisor, the trust situation seems to provide a better tax situation for franchisors because the receipt of the monies from the franchisee is not a taxing point for the franchisor. The situation in the Aussie Farmers case does involve a taxing point for the franchisor. Thirdly, again, assuming the potential qualification does not apply, where the funds are spent fairly quickly after payment in by the franchisee, it probably does not matter from a substantive income tax position whether there is a trust or not. In the trust situation, the receipt and the expenditure of the funds by franchisor is not a taxable event for the franchisor (no assessable income and no deduction). Where there is no trust, the tax treatment should be assessable income to franchisor on receipt and a deduction when monies are spent. But, when there is no trust in existence, a long-time gap between receipt of money and its expenditure means the franchisor is taxed upfront as income, but the deduction is delayed until expenditure occurs. It is here that the trust situation gives the franchisor a better income tax outcome compared to the no trust situation. And finally, what would be the regulatory impact under the Tax Act on the franchisor if the marketing fund was put on a trust footing (as opposed to current arrangements)? Assuming just franchisees’ monies are in this trust, the trust provisions of the Tax Act would apply. The franchisor would be the trustee. The trustee (franchisor) would need to comply with tax record-keeping rules, lodge tax returns for the trust (there would be interest income on the fund balance) and work out who is to be taxed on the income in the fund. So, a small number of tasks may be required to be undertaken that would not otherwise arise in the absence of a trust. There may also be the need for a Corporations Act 2001 report to ASIC. There would be no requirement to report to the overseer of trusts; as there is none, aside from State Supreme Courts.This level of compliance surrounding the trust situation needs to be compared with the level of compliance regarding the provision of an acceptable level of transparency and accountability when there is no trust (the current situation). There is arguably not much difference between the two situations from a regulatory impact perspective. It also needs to be remembered that the parties are largely free to build in as little or as much transparency into the trust as they want, subject to compliance with the legislation. If the parties do not set this out in the trust deed, general law will apply (e.g. trustees must maintain accurate accounts of transactions, accounts must be available to beneficiaries to see). That is, having a trust need not mean depriving beneficiaries of required transparency. Moving on, at a fundamental business model and brand-wide level, the funding, development and implementation of marketing, promotional and advertising activities should be addressed through a process that involves both the franchisor and its franchisees. Individual franchisees’ knowledge and understanding of their markets becomes very significant over time. Marketing the products/ services of franchisees in local areas is thus an activity where franchisees can contribute significantly to the success of a brand.  Unjust enrichment  As suggested earlier, it would be possible to argue that a range of different franchise stakeholders may be unjustly enriched by the marketing fund. These include the franchisors liquidators and, even the franchisor’s employees and the government, but as we saw from the Stay in Bed case, not the franchisees. The authors thank UNSW tax academic Dale Boccabella for his assistance with the tax analysis.  It is conceivable that franchisees could make out a claim in quasi-contract against the administrator or liquidator, for unjust enrichment. This action would theoretically be available to franchisees in Australia, though it has not been tested in the context of insolvency in Australian courts. It depends firstly on the court granting consent to franchisees to embark on litigation against the administrator or liquidator or against the directors or solvent related entities of the failed franchisor. Success in a restitutionary claim based on unjust enrichment depends upon the plaintiff establishing the following elements: Benefit or enrichment [defendant has been enriched by the receipt of a benefit – in the case of the franchisor, an upfront franchise fee that was charged for the right to conduct a franchise for, say, five years, but the franchisor became insolvent after two years – 3/5 of the initial franchise fee, and unexpended marketing fees, could be the starting point] At the plaintiff’s expense Unjust factor (unjust to allow the defendant to retain the benefit); and No bars to the restitutionary claim (no other consideration barring the claim, such as a subsisting valid and enforceable contract between the parties). To succeed in a restitutionary claim all four elements must be satisfied. In the first instance, the plaintiff must prove elements 1-3 on the balance of probabilities. In many cases this would be sufficient. Generally speaking, it is up to the defendant [eg the liquidator of the AFD franchisor] to raise the fourth element. Then the plaintiff [eg the government] must prove element 4. If, on the balance of probabilities, the court is not satisfied that there is no bar to a restitutionary claim, then the plaintiff fails.The use of an unjust enrichment action could be considered by franchisees that recently paid a franchise fee but derived very little benefit prior to the franchisor’s failure. Arguably, the pool of money available to the liquidator to pay creditors is artificially expanded by the  Bruce Moore (ed), The Australian Oxford Dictionary ed, 2010) 479. ‘Quasi-contract (implied contract) a form of the equitable remedy of restitution to restore an innocent party to his previous position.’  P Davenport and C Harris, Unjust Enrichment (1997) 34. franchise fee; thus the liquidator is ‘unjustly enriched’. This was pleaded by a group of franchisees in Ontario, Canada in one of the Country Style Food Services cases. There, whilst the franchisees did not act quickly or cohesively enough to succeed, the court did not rule out unjust enrichment as a possible cause of action for future franchisor insolvency cases’.One example of a franchisee claiming unjust enrichment, in a context unrelated to a marketing fund, occurred in Australia in Wang v HACCP Cleaning Australia Pty Ltd & OrsWang became a cleaning franchisee of HACCP Cleaning in April 2009.  After performing cleaning unsatisfactorily for two clients and losing their business in 2010 and 2011, the franchisor did not allocate any more jobs to Wang. The franchisor went into liquidation in January 2012. The final of five heads of claim by Wang against the franchisor claimed Churning and unjust enrichment.  The claim alleged that HACCP Cleaning received franchise fees from the plaintiff under the two contracts, but then on sold at least one of the contracts soon afterwards “thereby doubling its money unjustly”.  It also alleged that HACCP Cleaning claimed that it was unable to find any replacement contract for the plaintiff yet failed to refund the plaintiff’s money. [para 27] Wang did not satisfyDoyle J ofthe Appellate court that any of his five heads of claim held water, but, ‘even if made out, none of those claims will entitle the plaintiff to recovery of the franchise fees’.Unjust enrichment was pleaded in another franchise case, BSB Pty Ltd v Stan Meyer Pty Ltd, again unsuccessfully.  So, if liquidators, the current creditors and the government are the only ones benefitting from the money franchisees have paid into the marketing fund of an insolvent franchisor what can be done to address franchisees’ reasonable expectations?

Para 42  [2017] VCC 320 Conclusion As documented throughout this article, the issue of misuse of marketing funds has been put to policy makers and those charged with reviewing the industry code since 1993. Unfortunately, in that time, despite many legislative reviews, a profusion of stakeholder submissions and academic commentary, and the recommendation in the Wein Report of 2013, little has changed to ensure that franchisees are protected, and their marketing fund contributions are used ethically. This article has documented the recent debate on changes to the industry code and weighed stakeholder concerns against the need for protection of vulnerable franchisees. It is evident that the current laws are not effective against franchisor opportunism. The answer is not yet another protracted review process with tokenistic signalling that this is an issue that ought to be addressed. Instead real changes are needed. Changes that proactively ensure franchisor accountability and franchisee protection, not only changes that come into effect when it is too late, and a franchisor has become insolvent.  \n",

Despite advances in the knowledge management literature, our understanding of the role of the institutional context in knowledge transfer within social entrepreneurship remains inadequate. In particular, further explanation is needed about the role of institutions and the adaptation of the franchise model by social entrepreneurs in Africa. Using the qualitative induction methodology, we examine a social franchise network operating in Africa. Our findings suggest that social franchises respond to institutional frameworks (both formal and informal) to scale up their social impact on African countries. In settings dominated by formal institutions, social franchises transfer and adopt strategic knowledge and expand rapidly through direct franchising. In contrast, in those dominated by informal institutions, social franchises adapt their training strategies and use indirect franchising such as area master franchising. We provide valuable insights into the expansion of a rapidly growing business model within social entrepreneurship, social franchises, and show how this model responds to institutional environments in Africa.  Key words: Institutions, Social franchising, Franchising, knowledge transfer practices, AfricaIntroduction Franchising has been globally acknowledged as an engine for entrepreneurial growth in Western economies. It involves a contractual agreement between two independent parties to use the proven business format from the franchisor for a monetary fee paid by the franchisees (Alon, 2001). Due to its success, it has been adapted into smaller businesses and social enterprises mainly in developing countries as micro-franchising and social franchising, respectively (Crawford-Spencer & Cantatore, 2016; Giudici, Combs, Cannatelli, & Smith, 2018; Tracey & Jarvis, 2007). The franchise model involves the transfer of a business format from the franchisor to the franchisee, with the former providing training to the latter. However, less attention has been paid to the factors that promote and inhibit the transfer of knowledge in social franchises, despite its usefulness in having a social impact (Iddy & Alon, 2019). Prior research indicates that we cannot generalize about the barriers to knowledge transfer (Karagoz, Whiteside, & Korthaus, 2020). For example, existing studies have identified various factors that hinder knowledge transfer in the public sector (Amayah, 2013; Karagoz et al., 2020), higher education (Lockett, Cave, Kerr, & Robinson, 2009; Romano, Del Giudice, & Melita Nicotra, 2014), the oil and gas industries (Olaniran, 2017; Ranjbarfard, Aghdasi, López-Sáez, & López, 2014), ICT (Kukko, 2013), franchising (Iddy, 2020; Khan, 2016; Okoroafor, 2014) and social enterprises (Bloice & Burnett, 2016; Weerakoon, McMurray, Rametse, & Arenius, 2019). However, these studies present findings from developed economies with relatively stable institutional frameworks (Chliova & Ringov, 2017; Liao & Yu, 2012). In developed economies, businesses thrive due to stable institutions that ensure fair play. The situation is different in Africa, which has weak and informal institutions (Chliova & Ringov, 2017). In this situation, social franchises that grow by replicating knowledge struggle to protect their unique knowledge to ensure their competitive advantage (Ringov, Liu, Jensen, & Szulanski, 2017). Most social franchises focus on scaling up their social impact overlooking the institutional limitations where they operate or expand (Desa & Koch, 2014). Informal institutions pose a challenge for contract-based relationships such as franchising in transferring patent knowledge (Baena, 2012; Baena & Cervino, 2014). The role of institutions in the performance of social entrepreneurship has been underexplored in emerging economies, particularly regarding knowledge management (Brookes & Altinay, 2017). While it can be easier to generalize some of the contextual characteristics across Africa (Zoogah & Nkomo, 2013), research exploring country-specific factors needs further attention. Our study, therefore, seeks to answer the questions: How does the institutional environment in Africa affect knowledge transfer and how do social franchises respond to the institutional environment?When investigating these questions, we find that social franchises that expand successfully in Africa's different countries respond to the institutional environment. Some African countries have shown improvement in the formalization of laws and regulations, yet informal institutional frameworks still prevail to a large extent. As a result, we underscore the importance of examining the country-specific institutional environment and how it affects organizational practices. We contribute to a better understanding of how informal institutions in Africa affect social entrepreneurs’ growth. We argue that the failure to adapt a business model to the existing formal and informal institutions will undermine a social entrepreneurship’s growth strategy. The following theoretical section precedes the study’s empirical section, which discusses franchising in Africa, the rationale for social franchises in Africa, and the social franchise network where we collected our data. After that, the research method section is followed by the findings and a discussion about the study’s contributions and limitations, and suggestions for future research. Theoretical framework Institutions  The neo-institutional theory has undergone developmental changes since its inception in the late 1970s (Jepperson, 2002). In early 2010, the theory gained momentum in the organizational and management field (Alvesson & Spicer, 2019; Scott, 2008a). In an earlier explanation of institutional structures, institutional forces were usually equated with formal regulatory frameworks (Meyer & Rowan, 1977). Later on, Scott divided institutions into three groups: cultural-cognitive or mimetic, regulatory (related to DiMaggio and Powell’s (1983) notion of coercive), and normative (Scott, 2001, 2005).  Organizations adopt new structures and practices when entering another country. They do so not necessarily to increase the efficiency or effectiveness of the firm, but rather to comply with the regulations of the country and with its moral and cultural norms (Scott, 2005, 2008b). An organization’s actions are considered legitimate when they correspond to a country’s rules, laws, and monitoring system (Scott, 2008b). The normative element of the institutional environment comprises of socially accepted obligations, for example, through professional certification and accreditation (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Scott, 2005). The cultural-cognitive element emphasizes commonly shared beliefs of the society and taken-for-granted understandings ‘through which meaning is made’ (Scott, 2008b).  Similarly, institutional theorists categorize institutions into formal and informal structures (Morgan & Quack, 2005; North, 1990), which are the terms we shall adopt in this study. Formal and informal institutions include the political system, the legal system, and social and cultural beliefs (North, 1990). Regulatory elements that are formally composed and accepted to guide the legal framework and economic activities of society fall under the formal structures of institutions. Informal structures, on the other hand, comprise of cognitive and normative elements, which are unwritten codes of conduct (traditions, norms, culture, and customs) accepted by society to shape business activities (Scott, 2001). As North (1990) noted, organizations are constrained by either the formal or informal structures of institutions. These structures, however, tend to complement or substitute for each other (Estrin & Prevezer, 2011). Where informal and formal institutions are not incompatible, firms must deal with institutional misalignment (Chaux & Haugh, 2020; Williams & Vorley, 2015) or weak institutions when informal institutions dominate or substitute for formal ones (Estrin & Prevezer, 2011), as in the case of Africa and other developing countries (Zoogah, 2018). Drawing on findings from modern institutions in Western countries, researchers have maintained that strong institutions support organizations, while weak institutions hinder organizational performance (Estrin, Mickiewicz, & Stephan, 2016). Gradually, however, expanding research in weak institutions has determined that, rather than acting as constraints (Zoogah, Peng, & Woldu, 2015), organizations sometimes use weak institutional elements such as corruption to speed up their activities (Bahooa, Alon, & Paltrinieri, 2020; Jiménez & Alon, 2018). For instance, (Mbaku, 2010) showed how corruption can be used to circumvent legislation that has a negative effect on an organization’s profits. In countries with informal institutions, corruption has developed as a social norm to ease the cost of doing business (Zoogah, 2018). Others have gone further, demonstrating that the misalignment between formal and informal institutions might actually provide opportunities to entrepreneurs (Chaux & Haugh, 2020; Williams & Vorley, 2015) and a competitive advantage to MNC subsidiaries (Björkman, Fey, & Park, 2007; Clark & Lengnick-Hall, 2012). Institutions in Africa  Institutional theory is becoming an important perspective in research on Africa due to the distinct aspects of its institutions. However, the extant literature about knowledge management in Africa lacks an institutional perspective (Chliova & Ringov, 2017; Littlewood & Holt, 2018; Rivera-Santos, Holt, Littlewood, & Kolk, 2015; Zoogah et al., 2015). Although prior research generalizes its findings, giving the impression of uniformity in African countries (Zoogah et al., 2015), recent studies have started to recognize the diversity of African countries with different traditions, languages, political, economic, and legal structures (Nkakleu & Biboum, 2019; Zoogah, 2018). Understanding the institutional parameters of each country and how they affect knowledge management in entrepreneurship is of particular interest to organizations seeking to enter the African market (Aliouche, Fernandez, Chanut, & Gharbi, 2015; Rivera-Santos et al., 2015).  Corruption and poverty are still major problems in Africa. The UNDP reports that almost all countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from extreme poverty. In 2018 Transparency International stated that 10 out of the 20 most corrupt countries are from sub-Saharan Africa. Corruption and tribalism influence the recruitment process in sub-Saharan African organizations, factors that have a strong effect on knowledge management practices (Parboteeah, Seriki, & Hoegl, 2014). Additionally, unstable rules and regulations, labor regulations, lack of societal and economic support, and the failure to protect property rights reduce entrepreneurial activities by prompting people to seek income from formal employment rather than becoming self-employed (Estrin et al., 2016; Luo, 2020). Deficiencies in contract enforcement, transparency, and corruption have lead organizations to prefer business arrangements such as equity joint ventures (Kamoche & Harvey, 2006; Nkakleu & Biboum, 2019) or low control modes of governance such as master franchising (Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, & Nilsson, 2020; Rosado-Serrano, Paul, & Dikova, 2018).  Youth unemployment and lack of access to quality education and training programs in Africa create challenges in finding competent managers with managerial experience (Yessoufou, Blok, & Omta, 2018; Zoogah, Gomes, & Cunha, 2020; Zoogah et al., 2015). The limited education of employees hinders the transfer of knowledge (Chliova & Ringov, 2017). Lack of employment opportunities force young people to engage in informal businesses that are not formally registered with the legal authorities. While corruption influences the quality of judicial procedures and contract enforcement (Dixit, 2015; Knott & Miller, 2006; Zoogah et al., 2015), the failure to register businesses with the authorities limits the extent to which contract terms can be legally enforced (Chliova & Ringov, 2017).  All organizations (franchises and non-franchises) in Africa are subject to the same institutional situation (Scott, 2005). The response to this situation might differ according to the size, origin (foreign or local), and political endorsement of the business. For instance, large firms may respond to both the formal and informal institutional environment by trying to lobby the government to change some of the regulations (Chliova & Ringov, 2017), bribe politicians to establish strong social networks (Zoogah, 2018), or use misalignment as an entrepreneurial opportunity for small entrepreneurs (Camenzuli & McKague, 2015; Chaux & Haugh, 2020). Since entrepreneurship always occurs in a cultural context, understanding the effect of informal African institutions on knowledge management practices is critical to fostering social entrepreneurial growth and eradicating poverty there (Littlewood & Holt, 2018). Method Empirical context Franchising in AfricaThe franchising sector in Africa is growing. Africa is becoming an important market for foreign investors due to the potential growth of the African market (Odusola, 2020; Siggel, Maisonneuve, & Fortin, 2006), evident in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Morocco (Aliouche et al., 2015; Kastner, Mahmoud, Buame, & Gabrah, 2019; Siggel et al., 2006). Furthermore, franchising companies such as Hyatt, Marriott, Radisson, and Keller Williams have recently announced their plans to expand to more than 21 African countries on average, in addition to South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco. Although African entrepreneurs like international brands, being a foreign franchisor does not guarantee success. International franchises, however, face competition from locally developed franchises, which are also rapidly expanding across Africa. For example, in 2015, the Franchise Association of South Africa (FASA), which is the largest so far in Africa, reported that 88 percent of franchises in South Africa are domestic franchisors. This number is increasing and expanding across African countries. Apart from competition, foreign franchises often fail in Africa due to the lack of qualified franchisees, cultural misunderstandings, political instability, low per capita income, corruption, the weak rule of law, limited financial capital, and lack of franchise regulations (Aliouche et al., 2015; Alon, 2004; Siggel et al., 2006). Local franchises might have an added advantage over foreign franchises due to their ability to respond to institutional challenges. Social franchisingAlthough franchising is an inexpensive way to expand internationally (Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018), commercial franchising is very expensive (Kistruck, Webb, Sutter, & Ireland, 2011). This factor might explain why most commercial franchises started to expand to Africa very late. For example, popular brands such as Burger King, McDonald’s, KFC, and 7-Eleven, which require an average investment fee of approximately $2,146,511, are not yet common in Africa (Galic & Notaris, 2020). According to the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the institutional environment of African countries accounts for the limited number of commercial franchises in Africa. Companies find it difficult to function in places where there is weak rule of law, poverty, corruption, illiteracy, and the lack of a general understanding of the franchising concept among policy makers, entrepreneurs, academics and the general population. For example, the World Bank reported in 2015 that 413 million people who live in sub-Saharan Africa subsist on less than $1.90 a day. However, a bucket of five pieces of chicken at KFC in Tanzania is approximately $13. Thus, the African Development Bank (AfDB) stated that the franchise concept must be tailored to satisfy basic needs and target a low-income, rural population. Although the eradication of poverty is a concern for many sub-Saharan African countries and other international agencies, the World Bank also reported that the lack of sustainable solutions for solving social problems is linked to increased poverty. Both researchers and practitioners from different contexts have been inspired to come up with new innovations, know-how, and financial resources that will resolve this issue (Ciambotti & Pedrini, 2019; Desa & Koch, 2014; Si, Ahlstrom, Wei, & Cullen, 2020; Steinfield & Holt, 2019). Researchers in business model innovations have studied adapting the franchising model to not-for-profit organizations (NGOs) as a possible solution (Carril, 2014; Christensen, Parsons, & Fairbourne, 2010; Crawford-Spencer & Cantatore, 2016; Kistruck et al., 2011; Perrigot, 2018).   Social franchising is the use of commercial franchising logics in social enterprises (Christensen et al., 2010; Crawford-Spencer & Cantatore, 2016). Social franchising involves transferring knowledge to replicate the social impact of a well-established social solution (the social franchisor) to another individual or enterprise (the social franchisee) with the same social goals (Cumberland & Litalien, 2019; Ziólkowska, 2018). It enables social enterprises to combat social problems while making social entrepreneurs financially sustainable (Alon & Misati, 2011; Christensen et al., 2010). Unlike commercial franchising, social franchisors help social franchisees with financial capital (Smuts, Beckwith, Nkonyeni, Scheepers, & Bonnici, 2019). Although some social franchises started operation in developed countries, studies indicate the successful adaptability of the social franchising model in the base-of-pyramid (BOP) market (Giudici et al., 2018; Kistruck et al., 2011; Maciejewski, Jaana, Keely, Crowe, & Liddy, 2018). Evidence from the Rosenberg International Franchise Center (\"Franchie Indices,\" 2020) indicates that African countries rank high in the potential of social franchises and low in commercial franchises. However, although social problems look similar in most countries in the BOP market, their institutional settings can yield different outcomes when replicating business templates in different countries (Chliova & Ringov, 2017).  The company: The Alpha social franchise We explored the use of social franchises using a company that we refer to as Alpha. Alpha is a social franchise network in Africa that provides safe drinking water to underserved populations and business opportunities to local entrepreneurs. The company uses the franchise model to stimulate economic growth and create economic independence, while addressing the fundamental problems of unemployment and unsafe drinking water. To help many small entrepreneurs become social franchisees, Alpha co-invests with them by providing a water purification machine and guaranteeing them a start-up loan from micro-credit banks. It is currently operating in seven countries with 122 franchisees and at least 2000 retail points. The more Alpha sells water, the more it reaches a large population, while increasing sales. In doing so, it achieves its social and financial objectives. However, between 2017 and early 2019, Alpha started experiencing stagnation in performance. In an interview with the founder, he partly attributed this situation to inadequate training for franchisees.  As part of its support incentives, Alpha provides on-going monthly training to franchisees and periodically to other employees using the same modules in all countries. Monthly training in Alpha is designed for franchisees. This is because the Alpha franchise contract, like any other franchise contract, requires a franchisee to supervise the store's daily operation. For stores operated by a manager, it is the franchisees' responsibility to pass on the information to the manager after the meeting. The manager then communicates this information to the rest of the team members. Franchisees should gather information from managers and provide feedback to the franchisor (trainer) during the next meeting.   Although the empirical focus here is on the institutional environment of Rwanda and Uganda, Table 1 provides an overview of the institutional environment of the seven countries in which Alpha operates. The table indicates how the company is expanding (the number of franchised units) in an improved institutional setting such as Rwanda and a poor institutional environment such as the DRC in terms of corruption, contract enforcement, and ease of doing business. Additionally, the table also shows the rapid improvement in Tanzania with medium scores of ease-of-doing businesses through area master franchising. Since 2014, when the company started its first franchisees in Rwanda and Uganda, there has been a difference in performance. Growth in Rwanda in terms of the number of franchisees and franchised units has increased compared to Uganda. The difference in performance might be influenced by, but not limited to, the quality of the countries’ institutions. The ease of doing business index, which considers regulatory factors such as the quality of judicial processes, and the costs and time involved in resolving commercial disputes in a local first-instance court, positions Rwanda as the second-best country in sub-Saharan Africa (\"Market Overview,\" 2020). In 2019, the country’s commercial guide for U.S. companies and the International Trade Administration reported that since 2014, Rwanda’s business environment has improved due to reductions in corruption, crime, and political conflicts. Rwanda is the least corrupt country and the only country to score above the global average in East Africa according to (\"Transparency International,\" 2019). In contrast, in Uganda, corruption is still a severe problem. There is little political will to fight it to encourage a friendly business environment. Corruption index ranked Uganda as the third most corrupt country in East Africa, following South Sudan and Burundi (\"Transparency International,\" 2019). In addition, the country’s commercial guide for U.S companies reports that unregistered economic businesses and the sale of smuggled counterfeit products, especially from China, hinder foreign and local producers of consumer goods in Uganda.  The improvement in legal enforcement, corruption levels, and formal registration of businesses in Rwanda might be one of the reasons that Alpha permitted the growth of the company through multi-unit ownership there (Clarkin & Rosa, 2005; Hussain, Sreckovic, & Windsperger, 2018; Koch et al., 2020).

Social franchise chains operating in African countries:  Are their social goals aligned with the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals? Abstract Social franchise chains have social goals rather than – or in addition to – commercial or profit-making goals. But are these social goals, targeted by social franchisors, aligned with the SDGs? And if it is the case, with which ones in particular? Based on legitimacy theory, we examine the disclosure of SDG-related information on websites of 69 social franchise chains operating in Africa. Our main findings show that social goals targeted by social franchisors are aligned with certain SDGs, the ones that are general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education. Our paper contributes to the literature on franchising and on the role of the private sector, in particular SMEs and social franchising, in the achievement of SDGs and offers managerial implications. Keywords Social franchising, Sustainable Development Goals, Emerging markets, Africa, Legitimacy Introduction  In the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations has listed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that address inequality (Freistein and Mahlert, 2016). They are considered a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for [everyone]. They address the global challenges [societies] face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice.” The United Nations insists on the fact that “in order to leave no one behind, it is important that [societies] achieve them all by 2030.”Ambassador Joon, President of ECOSOC – UN, emphasized: “Under this backdrop, the role of the private sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), is integral if the international community is to achieve the SDGs by their target date” (Joon, 2018, p. 6). In the same vein, Cheru (2016, p. 1277) stated that “much more work remains to be done to accelerate economic growth and reduce human deprivation in Africa in the coming 15 years. […] This will require […] the involvement of a wide spectrum of actors from the private sector, civil society, philanthropies and governments.” Despite these calls for actions from the private sector and SMEs in particular, “extant international business research hardly covers the private sector’s role in achieving international policy goals” (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018, p. 208).  In this research, we focus on a specific type of SME, social franchise chains. Indeed, recent academic papers (e.g., Aliouche and Schlentrich, 2015; Asemota and Chahine, 2016; Crawford-Spencer, 2015; Crawford-Spencer and Cantatore, 2016; Kistruck et al., 2011; Naatu and Alon, 2019; Naatu et al., 2020; Perrigot, 2018), as well as trade papers, have addressed the emergence, development, and operation of social franchise chains that try to meet, and often succeed in                                                  https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ meeting, these SDGs. Obviously, as their name indicate, these social franchise chains have social goals rather than – or in addition to – commercial or profit-making goals (Du Toit, 2014; Smith, 2002). Are social goals, targeted by social franchisors, aligned with the SDGs? And if it is the case, with which ones in particular? These are the questions we explore in this paper.  Employing legitimacy theory as our theoretical background, and Africa as our empirical setting, we explore these questions by examining the disclosure of SDG-related information on social franchisor websites. While, in terms of research, there is a growing stream of literature dealing with social franchising (Naatu and Alon, 2019; Perrigot, 2018), as far as we know, there are no papers published on the subject of SDGs in link with social franchise chains.  Franchising provides a specific and relevant context with which to examine SDGs. First, social franchising is an option for replicating and scaling impact and social impact (Asemota and Chahine, 2016), and thus for replicating and scaling social impact in terms of SDG achievement. Second, the actions undertaken to achieve SDGs take place on two levels, the chain and the stores. The impact is then higher than that of a traditional enterprise that is not organized as a chain. Third, the issue of franchisor/franchisee independence is a challenge, as both have to collaborate and work toward the aim of achieving the SDGs in order to succeed. Our empirical study deals with social franchise chains operating in Africa. Our sample includes 69 chains operating in agriculture, clean water and sanitation, education, energy, and healthcare sectors in various countries in Africa. Our main findings confirm that almost all (94.20%) social franchise chains operating in Africa disclose information about at least one SDG on their websites. Social franchisors in Africa thus aspire to contribute to the achievement of certain                                                   We prefer to consider this a representative sample and not the actual amount of social franchise chains operating in Africa, though we have tried to be as exhaustive as possible when compiling the list in case some social franchise chains operating in Africa do not have websites. SDGs. We observed that the SDGs targeted by the majority of franchisors are quite general in nature and not only sector-dependent, except in the case of education.  Our paper contributes to the literature on franchising and SDGs. First, regarding the social franchising stream, based on franchisor disclosure on their websites, we highlight that franchisor social goals are aligned with certain SDGs. Second, regarding the franchising in emerging countries stream of literature, franchising in Africa has not caught the attention of many researchers so far, despite its potential for development (exceptions are Naatu et al., 2020; Perrigot, 2017, 2018). We thus provide evidence for the development of franchise operations in the African continent. Third, regarding the CSR in franchising stream, this paper builds on studies addressing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) in franchise chains by focusing on several dimensions, such as environmental and social concerns of SDGs. Fourth, our research also contributes to the limited literature stream on SDGs and, more specifically, the role of the private sector, in particular SMEs, in the achievement of SDGs (Desta and McMaohn, 2015; Mills, 2018; Munro et al., 2017). Our paper also contributes to the practice by providing examples of the types and varieties of social goals social franchisors can pursue. The findings show the potential for such franchise chains to achieve SDGs. Thus, entrepreneurs might be encouraged to launch their franchise concept as franchisors who contribute to SDGs at an international, national, or regional level or to join franchise chains as franchisees who contribute to SDGs at the local level as well. Literature review Franchising in Africa Except for the few studies conducted on franchising in South Africa (Du Toit, 2003; van Wyk and De Jager, 2009), the African continent has not caught the attention of many franchising researchers, despite the development of local and foreign franchise chains in many African countries (Perrigot, 2017). The limited research that has dealt with franchising in African countries, excluding South Africa, has mainly concerned one specific sector: the healthcare sector (an exception is the case of Fan Milk micro-franchised chain selling ice cream and yogurt in western Africa by Christensen et al. (2010)). Prata et al. (2005), relying on data from The World Bank's Health Nutrition and Population Poverty Thematic Reports on 22 African countries, concluded that “franchising has the greatest potential for integration into large-scale programmes in Africa to address critical illnesses of public health importance” (p. 274). Perrigot (2018) examined the franchise business model of one chain of clinics, CFWclinics, in Kenya. She concluded that social franchising seems to work no differently from franchising in more traditional sectors, at least in terms of know-how, assistance, brand name, and franchisor/franchisee and franchisee/franchisee relationships. Naatu et al. (2020) showed, through a case study conducted on an anonymous micro-franchising chain in the healthcare sector in Rwanda, the importance of relying on a public-private partnership or having a governmental endorsement to succeed. Social franchising and SDGs Franchising in the healthcare sector is often referred to as, or part of, social franchising. Social franchising is defined as “the application of commercial franchising methods and concepts to achieve socially beneficial ends” (Temple, 2011, p. 3). Put differently, “social franchises are a new type of hybrid organisations and social enterprises that adopts franchising strategy to provide social goods and services in underserved areas” (Naatu et al., 2020, p. 1). Social franchising can be a relevant and powerful means for providing access to quality healthcare services, drinking water, solar energy, and education at affordable prices to many people in emerging countries (Perrigot, 2018). Various authors have tried to compare social franchising to social enterprise (Crawford-Spencer, 2015; Du Toit, 2014) or social entrepreneurship (Aliouche, 2015), have distinguished between for profit and not for profit organizations (Crawford-Spencer and Cantatore, 2016); and have pointed out the stages of social franchising (Asemota and Chahine, 2016).  Social franchisors often use micro-franchising, i.e., “a business model adaptation that helps low-income individuals overcome non credit-related barriers to entry in obtaining employment.” (Chistensen et al., 2010, p. 595). More specifically, microfranchising “provides, via sale, a vetted and replicable turnkey business to buyers in subsistence markets who commit to follow the model.” (Chistensen et al., 2010, p. 595). Social franchisors have then two types of social goals, vis-à-vis the customers (access to basic products and/or services) and the micro-franchisees (access to a job) as summarized in Chart 1. Chart 1: Social franchisors and their social goals What we explore in this paper is the goals of these social franchisors through the lens of SDGs, which have been the focus of governments and enterprises in the last few years but that have been largely ignored in the literature on small business management. In September 2015, in Social franchisorsBasic products and/or services offered to customersJobs offered to micro-franchiseesSocial goals their agenda for sustainable development, the United Nations and its Member States set up a plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity over the next 15 years. This agenda included 17 SDGs built on the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. These SDGs were directed toward pinpointing and carrying out essential actions at the global level (Joon, 2018). They included areas such as poverty reduction, access to education, healthcare, energy, and climate change. As the 17 SDGs are interconnected, they need to be addressed quickly and together (Sachs et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). The United Nations has asserted that national governments and international organizations are not able to achieve these SDGs alone. They need the contributions of various stakeholders: the private sector, international institutions, academia, NGOs, among others (Joon, 2018). The 2030 Agenda explicitly recognizes the role of the private sector in implementing its goals, for instance SDGs 8 – Decent work and economic growth, 9 – Industry, innovation, and infrastructure and 17 – partnerships for the goals. But even to achieve the other SDGs, the role of the private sector, and particularly SMEs in emerging markets, is essential. As such, there have been calls for “aligning the small business community alongside the United Nations on [their] work toward sustainable development” (Joon, 2018, p. 6). SMEs include many types of enterprises, among which are both sides of franchising, that is, not only franchisee enterprises but also franchisor enterprises. Franchisee enterprises are often small businesses run by franchisees or micro-franchisees who are independent entrepreneurs running their businesses under a certain brand and benefiting from the franchisor brand, know-how and assistance. These local SMEs can be operated by franchisees or micro-franchisees working alone in many cases, and having employees in some cases. The franchisor enterprises, contrary to what one might imagine, are often SMEs as well. Usually the franchisor employs a few staff members at the franchise chain headquarters, mainly in the development, management, and marketing departments. Theoretical background Legitimacy theory is the most widely used framework for explaining enterprise disclosures about their environmental and social behaviors and, more broadly, their CSR practices (Gray et al., 1995; Hooghiemstra, 2000). The applications of legitimacy theory are varied. For instance, they can apply to enterprises in mining, oil, mineral extraction, forestry, gas, chemicals, metals, and autos, engineering and construction, service, and food and retailing (Guthrie and Parker, 1989; Adams et al., 1998; Patten, 1991, 1992; Deegan et al., 2002; O’Donovan, 2002). Legitimacy is defined as “a generalised perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions” (Suchman, 1995, p. 574). A key concept of legitimacy theory is the existence of a social contract between an enterprise and the society in which it operates (Deegan, 2000; Deegan, 2002; Mathews, 1993; Patten, 1991; 1992). This social contract is used to represent the expectations society has about how an enterprise should conduct its operations (Deegan, 2000; Mathews, 1993). Enterprise survival is thus dependent on the extent that the enterprise operates “within the bounds and norms of [the] society” (Brown and Deegan, 1998, p. 22), corresponds to the society’s expectations (Deegan et al., 2002), and thus benefits from the support of the society (Deegan, 2014). Or, put differently, the survival of an enterprise can be threatened if the society perceives that it has breached its social contract (Deegan, 2002). In more detail, according to Shocker and Sethi (1973, p. 97), “any social institution – and business is no exception – operates in society via a social contract, expressed or implied, whereby its survival and growth are based on: (1) the delivery of some socially desirable ends to society in general; and (2) the distribution of economic, social or political benefits to groups from which it derives its power.” CSD entails providing information, in reports and/or on corporate websites, legitimizing enterprises’ behaviors by influencing their various stakeholders’ and the society’s perceptions of these enterprises (Neu et al., 1998). These enterprises expect to be considered “good corporate citizen[s]” and have their actions justify their continued existence (Campopiano and De Massis, 2015). This is particularly true for social franchisors operating in Africa when disclosing information on SDGs. Indeed, these franchisors expect to be considered “good corporate citizen[s]” by offering products and/or services such as water, solar lamps, education, and health care of high quality at affordable prices to local customers, and providing franchising and employment opportunities to local communities. The various stakeholders and the society these franchisors interact with include local governments, the partnered NGOs, donors and potential ones, franchisees and potential ones, employees and potential ones, and customers and potential ones.  In this paper, we focus on social franchisors’ CSD on SDGs that have not been the focus of academic research on small business management despite the call from the UN. We intend to fill this gap by examining the question: “Are social goals, targeted by social franchisors, aligned with the SDGs? And if it is the case, with which ones in particular?” Methodology  We needed first to build our “sample” of social franchise chains operating in Africa. We proceeded with a series of searches on several search engines, and a combination of specific franchising-, industry- and Africa-related keywords. Our list included 69 social franchise chains operating in various industries (such as, agriculture, clean water and sanitation, education, energy, and healthcare) and in various countries in Africa (Burkina-Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). In addition to the industries and the countries, these 69 franchise chains were varied in terms of experience (number of years since the start of franchising), size (number of franchised units), and organizational form (e.g., franchising only, franchising and company ownership, franchising and micro-franchising). On each of the 69 franchise chain websites, we searched for information addressing one or more of the 17 SDGs. We included explicit information with exact references to the SDGs, as well as implicit information, for instance, with expressions such as “stopped spending money on kerosene,” “create permanent jobs,” “employment opportunities,” “ability to earn a living,” “increase monthly income,” or “empowers micro-entrepreneurs to earn an income” in reference to SDG n°1 – No poverty. We found that 65 social franchise chains operating in Africa disclosed information on at least one SDG on their websites. For each of these 65 franchise chains disclosing information on at least one SDG, we copied and pasted the information (that is, a paragraph, a sentence, a part of a sentence, or a combination) in an Excel file. We thus gathered a corpus of qualitative data with information referring to one or several of the 17 SDGs.  Findings  SDG information disclosure (presence or not) on social franchisor websites According to Table 1, around three quarters of the franchisors disclosed information about reduced inequalities (79.71%), partnerships for the goals (79.71%), and sustainable cities and communities (71.01%). More than half of the franchisors provided information about good health and well-being (69.57%), decent work and economic growth (69.57%), poverty eradication (56.52%), and industry, innovation, and infrastructure (56.52%). About half of the franchisors disclosed information on quality education (49.28%) and gender equality (44.93%). We observed that the SDGs targeted by the majority of social franchisors were quite general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education.  Moreover, we observed social franchisors disclosed information on up to 13 SDGs. About 10% of the franchisors disclosed information on four SDGs (8.70%), six SDGs (8.70%), seven SDGs (11.59%), nine SDGs (10.14%), ten SDGs (11.59%), or eleven SDGs (8.70%). And about 20% of the franchisors disclosed information about eight SDGs (17.39%). To sum up, there was no single trend in terms of communicating about SDGs among chains, but, globally, many of the social franchisors conveyed their interest in certain SDGs, underlining the alignment between franchisor social goals and SDGs.  << Insert Table 1 here >> Main SDG information disclosure (examples of content) on franchisor websites Reduced inequalities and partnerships for the goals A total of 79.71% of the chains disclosed information about SDG10 – Reduced inequalities and SDG17 – Partnerships for the goals on their websites.  Regarding reduced inequalities, they pointed out that they addressed the “bottom of the pyramid,” the underserved, vulnerable, and marginalized communities. For instance, Chain #31 disclosed the following: “[Brand] has developed an innovative distribution network that brings life-changing products to the people who need them most, that is to say to the last-mile delivery low-income communities.” Chain #5 mentioned: “In order to expand access to vision care and eyeglasses for the BoP customer, [Brand] brings vision campaigns to rural and urban communities that have limited access to eye care services.”  In link with reduced inequalities, customer locations were also referred to. Indeed, chains often specified that they served people in remote and rural areas in addition to urban, peri-urban, sub-urban areas, and townships. For instance, we found the following mentions: “Our [Brand] clinics promote the well- being of the undeserved by providing access to quality reproductive healthcare for all regardless of location or ability to pay.” [#20] Or, “In [year], [group name] initiated a mobile outreach service strategy through its [Brand] social franchise clinical network to expand access to FP [Family Planing] in [Country]’s under-served rural areas.” [#16] Or, “800 solar lamps were generously donated and distributed by [partnered organization name] as part of their project to help marginalised rural communities like the [nationality].” [#42] Or, “Drawing on the principles of successful franchising around the world, we are building a franchise network of agri-dealers located in rural, undeserved areas of [Country].” [#63]  A few chains in the energy sector specifically targeted refugees as potential customers, Chain #33 specified: “In [year], we had our first opportunity to partner with the Red Cross International to implement solar kiosks in one of the refugee camps in [Country]”. A few others focused on people with disabilities as potential micro-franchisees, for instance, Chain #33 also mentioned: “[...] That empowers mostly women and people with disabilities using a micro franchise business model.”  Regarding partnerships for the goals, the partners consisted of various types: governments, NGOs, aid agencies, academic institutions, private enterprises, insurance enterprises, influencers, and donors. For instance, we found the following mentions: “[Brand] works with a strong network of NGOs and governments.” [#2] Or, “Collaboration – connecting communities, NGOs, cooperates, students, public bodies and individuals to create the best possible solutions.” [#32]  These partnerships were concerned with innovations and the launch of new products and/or services (e.g., “This success was achieved in collaboration with a number of partners including mobile network operators, banks, implementing partners, community leaders and influencers.” [#9]), funding of projects (e.g., “More than 95 percent of our funding comes from governments, bilateral and multilateral international organizations, and foundations.” [#58] Or, “[Brand] is reliant on funding (until we reach 50 Clinics in the Network) from donors […] in order to expand the Network.” [#17]), and product distribution (e.g., “[Brand] partners with non-governmental organizations, governments, social enterprises and private businesses to distribute eyeglasses using their existing distribution channels. By leveraging existing distribution channels, as seen in our partnerships [...] we are able to greatly expand our reach into countries and areas of countries where we do not have an on-the-ground presence. This increases the distribution of eyewear to the BoP consumer while keeping costs low.” [#5]).  Partnerships for the goals could be local, national, and international, as highlighted on Chain #9 website: “Our programs have been successful as a result of active collaboration and the strengthening of partnerships with a number of public and private sector organisations, both local and international.”  Sustainable cities and communities A total of 71.01% of the chains disclosed information about SDG11 – Sustainable cities and communities on their websites. They mainly focused on contributing to sustainable communities by providing these communities with health services, education, and solar energy as well as entrepreneurial opportunities. Chain #32 for instance disclosed: “To help development organisations build sustainable and independent communities.” Or Chain #42 indicated: “[Brand] will further strengthen communities from the inside by increasing our support for local economies, to drive greater change, create more opportunities and generate more income for those who deliver solar energy with us.”  Good health and well-being, and decent work and economic growthIn equivalent proportions, 69.57% of the chains disclosed information about SDG3 – Good health and well-being and SDG8 – Decent work and economic growth on their websites.  Regarding good health and well-being, for chains operating in the health sector, they provided access to high-quality healthcare services at affordable prices. Many of them focused on reproductive health and family planning services, others on children’s health, and a few on menstrual issues. For instance, we found the following mentions: “It uses an innovative social franchise strategy under the [Brand] label to improve access, equity in reproductive health and child survival with the distribution of many products.” [#13] Or, “We also focus on reproductive health, family planning, maternal, new born and child health, as well as prevention and control of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.” [#60]  Moreover, some franchisors from other industries indirectly contributed to the better health of the population by providing light and equipment to clinics (e.g., “[Brand] means our lights and medical equipment always function to help us to do life-saving work! For example, before, it was really hard for our maternity ward to deliver babies safely, now with our [Brand] system we are much better equipped to work 24 hours a day with the lighting we need!” [#36]), sanitation for homes (e.g., “To provide affordable top-quality mobile/portable toilets. To maintain and sustain a clearer and healthier environment.” [#47]), or by proposing products that reduce the negative impact of others on health (e.g., “Solar lighting reduces the risk of fire, lung damage, eye strain and eliminates toxic, poisonous kerosene from the home. […] Replacing kerosene or paraffin with portable, affordable solar lights improve health, makes a home safer.” [#37]). Some franchisors also wanted to empower people in health improvement, such as indicated on Chain #7 website: “[Brand] [Country] has a mission to empower [nationality] particularly the poor and vulnerable to lead healthier lives.”  Regarding decent work and economic growth, some of franchisors aspired to provide Africans with decent jobs as either employees or franchisees or micro-franchisees. Disclosures for instance include: “[Brand] franchisees make money while solving their communities’ issues, generating hundreds of new local jobs and igniting a virtuous cycle of wealth generation for themselves and their communities.” [#43] Or, “Other beneficiaries of the business will be franchise holders themselves and their staff, with over many jobs created by the franchise business in four years. Qualified veterinary personnel will be recruited as franchisees; and by including animal health technicians as well as vets...” [#50]  Social franchisors provided support and training from the perspective of capacity building, as illustrated by Chain #54 mentioned: “The principals and practitioners learn new skills to implement in their communities to ensure sustainable businesses [branded name centers] and make a difference in the lives of those around them.”  All these actions support economic growth. No poverty, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure A total of 56.52% of the chains disclosed information about SDG1 – No poverty and SDG9 – Industry, innovation, and infrastructure on their websites.  Regarding no poverty, some chains aimed to reduce poverty by providing the population with affordable products and/or services or benefiting them from savings acquired by lowering consumption of other types of products/services that are more expensive or less respectful of the environment. An example is from Chain #34 website: “[Brand] uses a network of local franchises to rent out lights for a price that is similar or even cheaper than kerosene or candles. With no upfront investments, our customers can enjoy better quality lighting.”  The contribution of the franchise chains to poverty alleviation could be considered at an entrepreneurial level as well; that is, through the franchisees and the micro-franchisees. Indeed, some chains offered entrepreneurial opportunities to franchisees and micro-franchisees to help them rise above the poverty level, Chain #34 for instance disclosed: “Whilst working for [Brand], [First name of a franchisee] saved enough money to build a house for him and his wife.”  A focus on women entrepreneurship was also highlighted through social franchisors providing women with franchising opportunities, as suggested here: “To empower black women, build a sustainable network of nurse owned and operated primary healthcare clinics nationally and create permanent jobs.” [#17] Finally, at the employee level, franchising offered job opportunities for employees of franchisees and micro-franchisees to also give them the opportunity to work their way out of poverty. For instance, Chain #44 indicated: “These micro-entrepreneurs, [Brand] Operators, have created 175 jobs for neighbors who run their daily business operations.”  Regarding industry, innovation, and infrastructure, most innovations concerned business models and concepts, as illustrated by these numerous examples: “It uses an innovative social franchise strategy under the [Brand] label to improve access, equity in reproductive health and child survival with the distribution of many products.” [#13] Or, “Our technical expertise, marketing acumen and strong relationships with franchisees has kept us on the cutting edge of healthcare innovation since the launch of our first franchise in [Country] in [year].” [#58] Or, “[Brand name]’s proposed innovation is to establish a micro franchise model in sub Saharan Africa for agricultural inputs and market linkages.” [#52] Or, “The concept is innovative not for its technological aspects, but rather for its model of distributing electricity and energy services, with the goal of reaching the majority of the local population, particularly the most vulnerable.” [#31] Quality education A total of 49.28% of the chains disclosed information about SDG4 – Quality education on their websites. Those operating in the education sector provided access to education services for every child, whether in urban or rural areas, with a focus on quality (content of the courses and training of the teachers) and at affordable prices. Chain #54 for instance disclosed: “We aim to achieve our vision through providing quality whole school teacher training and mentoring to early childhood development centres across [Country] in rural, townships and suburban areas.”  Some franchisors from other industries indirectly contributed to bettering the education of children through the provision of electricity or equipment to schools (e.g., “[Brand] electrified 2 schools by building a kiosk together with [partner name] and [partner name].

Kids therefore now enjoy proper lighting inside the classrooms and screens on which teachers can show them educational movies.” [#34]) and/or supplies of lamps for home study (e.g., “Now that they have their own solar lamps, kids can do their homework, read, write stories, draw pictures and help their parents with tasks in the evening.” [#42]). A few franchisors also indirectly provided better health conditions or made jobs available to parents that allowed them to pay for the education of their children. A couple of other franchisors aimed at educating older people from the perspective of capacity building. Gender equality A total of 44.93% of the chains disclosed information about SDG5 – Gender equality on their websites. Some franchisors focused on gender equity in terms of access to health services, contraception, or education. Chain #1 indicated: “When contraception use increases, states can have [...] less gender inequality.”  The goals of various chains were to empower women, e.g., “To empower black women, build a sustainable network of nurse owned and operated primary healthcare clinics nationally and create permanent jobs.” [#17] Chain #24 also disclosed: “Given the historical injustices on women, [Brand] believes in working with men to stimulate gender equity and ultimately contributing to the achievement of gender equality in economic, political and cultural issues.”  Franchisors promoted gender equity in terms of employment and entrepreneurial opportunities (e.g., “Each micro-enterprise is owned and operated by groups of women. This provides full-time employment to local women […].” [#49]), and, on occasion, access to loans (e.g., “Microloans are targeted to meet the needs of women.” [#60]). Discussion  Summary of findings Our findings show that social goals targeted by social franchisors are aligned with certain SDGs. The majority of franchisors targeted SDGs that were general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education. Indeed, as indicated in Chart 2, the SDGs most often targeted are: reduced inequality, partnerships for the goals, sustainable cities and communities, good health and well-being, decent work and economic growth, poverty reduction, industry, innovation and infrastructure, quality education, and gender equality.  Chart 2: Social franchisors and their social goals through the lens of SDGs Contributions to the literatureOur paper offers contributions to the literature on franchising, first, by enriching the stream on social franchising. Social franchise chains have a social mission, explicit or not, that can be source of conflicts (Tracey and Jarvis, 2007) but also source of innovation (Giudici et al., 2018). We demonstrated that, in link with their social missions, social franchisors in Africa disclose SDG-related information on their websites, and thus support, or have the willingness to support, the achievement of SDGs. Their social goals thus correspond to certain SDGs. Secondly, our research enriches the literature on franchising in emerging countries (Alon and Welsh, 2002; Kaufmann and Leibenstein, 1988; Welsh et al., 2006) and in Africa (Naatu et al., 2020; Perrigot, 2017; 2018), that is scarce, despite its potential for development and the academic interest in Social franchisorsReduced inequalityPartnerships for the goalsSustainable cities and communitiesGood health and well-beingDecent work and economic growthPoverty reductionIndustry, innovation and infrastructureQuality educationGender equalitySocial goals franchising in other emerging markets such as Brazil (Bitti et al., 2019) or China (Jeon et al., 2016; Grünhagen et al., 2012). Thirdly, this paper builds on the research dealing with CSR and CSD in franchise chains (Meiseberg and Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015) by focusing on several dimensions, including the environment (e.g., climate action) or social aspects (e.g., gender equality) of the SDGs.  Our paper also adds to the limited literature on SDGs and, more specifically, on the role of the private sector, in particular SMEs and franchisors, in the achievement of SDGs (Desta and McMaohn, 2015; Mills, 2018; Munro et al., 2017). Most research on SDGs focused on one SDG only (e.g., zero hunger for Dawson et al. (2019) or Tura (2019), affordable and clean energy for Shen and Power (2017)).  Contributions to the practice Our paper contributes to the practice by providing evidence of the types and varieties of SDGs social franchisors can pursue. We show the potential of such social franchise chains to achieve SDGs. Our findings can encourage entrepreneurs to either launch their franchise concepts as franchisors who contribute to the achievement of SDGs at international, national, or regional levels, or join franchise chains as franchisees who contribute at the local level. We also show that franchising as a business model can be adapted to respond to local needs using social franchising. It suggests a large range of products and/or services where franchising can be applied. Finally, this paper can help governments and public organizations in developing countries that often only associate franchising with hospitality and retail sectors to better understand and assess the role of franchising in achieving social goals in general, and SDGs in particular. Limitations and tracks for future research Our research has some limitations. On the one hand, some are linked to the nature of the data. Indeed, we relied on data disclosed by franchisors on the Internet at a given time. We observed the disclosure of SDG-related information and not the SDG achievement; this, of course, constituted a limit even though website observations were used in various papers dealing with CSD (Axjonow et al., 2018; Perrigot et al., 2015). Case studies, interviews or a questionnaire-based survey on social franchisors and/or their franchisees would better assess franchise chain SDGs orientation. In order to minimize subjectivity in the interpretation of SDGs-related information, we used a codebook and the two authors were involved in the data collection and categorization check. We could also go further in the analysis of the communication and the achievement of some specific SDGs. An in-depth investigation of SDG5 – Gender equality could be, for instance, conducted in link with women entrepreneurship that has attracted significant attention in the African context (e.g., Amine and Staub, 2009). Moreover, this data provided a snapshot at a given time of social franchisors communicating on the SDGs. Comparing disclosure and achievements after a certain period of time (a few years) through a questionnaire-based survey and/or an analysis of CSR reports would help to understand the process of achieving SDGs, and not only the communication on SDGs. Furthermore, franchisors do use their websites to attract donors, partners, and franchisee candidates. They are likely to overestimate their contributions to SDGs to appear as responsible franchisors and to project a better image vis-à-vis these stakeholders. Finally, another limitation deals with the focus on Africa. We could enlarge the research to other emerging markets in order to assess if social franchisors in other regions target SDGs as well. Conclusion This paper is a first attempt to demonstrate the role of social franchising and, more broadly, the role of small businesses, in promoting SDGs. Our findings show that social goals of franchisors operating in the social sector in Africa are aligned with certain SDGs, those that are general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education. They were the following: reduced inequality, partnerships for the goals, sustainable cities and communities, good health and well-being, decent work and economic growth, poverty reduction, industry, innovation and infrastructure, quality education, and gender equality. More research on this topic is needed. \n",

       "FRANCHISING LESSONS IN THE AGE OF INCIVILITY:  OPERATIONS MANUALS AND TRADE SECRETS © Robert W. Emerson, 2021* Abstract The framework for a successful franchise relationship governs procedures, performance, and standards. The franchisor agrees to lend, in effect, its intellectual property and guidance, among other things, in exchange for the franchisee’s royalties and other payments. Before entering an agreement, franchisors disclose a large bundle of information to the prospective franchisee. These data may include operational insights necessary for a franchise’s success. In practice, though, franchise operations manuals only become available to franchisees once they pay for and are bound to the franchise system. This timing, and the centrality of the manual, is the key to many franchise disputes. For example, franchisees may allege they were harmed by vague, precontractual representations about the contents of operations manuals, which in turn franchisors would justify as a way to provide required disclosures while protecting trade secrets.  When operations manuals are leaked – whether negligently, maliciously, or recklessly – or when the franchisee (or ex-franchisee) uses the manual’s processes and information without permission, then trade secret or antitrust law may impute liability. In Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners, LLC, a franchisor claimed its franchisee infringed the franchisor’s copyright by promoting a service that competed against the franchise network; while the franchisee allegedly used the franchisor’s trade secrets in spite of the two parties’ preexisting relationship barring such conduct, Molly Manners illustrates how the franchisor could have proactively amended the franchise agreement to delineate franchisee duties and prohibitions. A franchisor could file claims against its franchisee under the law of trademarks, trade secrets (e.g., the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or the Defend Trade Secrets Act), and antitrust. Lessons that emerge from this Article’s survey of franchise law and practice can serve as guiding principles for franchisors and franchisees alike.

IntroductionIf Hammurabi, ruler of ancient Babylonia and noted promulgator of a great code of law, somehow returned to Earth as a fast-food franchisor, he would face three questions: 1.The profound - How was such an incredible feat, a resurrection after nearly four millennia, See Kathryn E. Slanski, The Law of Hammurabi and its Audience, 24 YALE J.L.UMAN. 97, 101–06 (2012) (providing a detailed explanation of Hammurabi’s Law Steleaccomplished? 2. The profane – Why franchising, why fast-food?     3. The particular – What new “code” would he have?    Only the last question is easily answered. Hammurabi would establish an operations manual. At his network of hamburger outlets, McHammurabi’s “Burger Code” (its operations manual) would rule.  Certainly, any franchisor, at McHammurabi’s or wherever, would not hold the extreme, one-sided powers of a Babylonian king. Modern franchising should instead be seen as a tale of two parties, franchisor and franchisee, sometimes - perhaps often – ignorant about and also at odds with each other; and while maintaining secrecy may be a natural, human predisposition, surely business and legal issues arise between a franchisor and its franchisees if there are more secrets between them than are kept from their joint competitors and rivals. For the franchise parties aligned within their “empire” (their business network), an indeterminate equilibrium – a chaotic confluence of confidence, cooperation yet conflict - is frequently at the heart of disputes about their franchise system’s operations manual. A. Operations Manuals        The operations manual is the nucleus of a franchise. It is the foundation governing performance, procedures, and conduct, and it establishes the expectations between franchisor and franchisee. In great detail, it states the standards, specifications, and procedures with which franchisees must abide by to operate their business and adequately represent the franchisor’s brand. In short, it is the condicio sine qua non between the franchisor and the franchisee. It still may take the form of a traditional paper-bound manual, although franchisors often state in the franchise agreement that the “manual” also includes any e-mails, physical mail, or other types of documents received by the franchisee.The manual may be considered the Magna Carta or the Ten Commandments of the relationship between  That is a recurring theme not just in law, business, and franchising but also, broadly, life and literature. It is “[a] wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.” HARLES ICKENSALE OF ITIES, Book 1, chapter 3 (1859).

ROBERT URVIN., TRANCHISE RAUD 20–35(1994). the franchisee and franchisor. If, for example, a franchisee runs afoul of the expectations established in the operations manual or engages in unfair competitive conduct – such as using the information in the manuals to outcompete other franchisees – antitrust laws would, arguably, be violated. In contrast, if the contents of an operations manual unreasonably restrained what a franchisee could and could not do, there would also be a violation by the franchisor. With this established framework we turn to the aptly named Civility case. Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners, LLC Civility Experts Worldwide v. Molly Manners LLC there were two Rocky Mountain enterprises whose livelihood revolved around etiquette and propriety. Both promoted “civility training solutions”indeed, their core business models emphasized “good manners and civility, and [yet] one of them stole the other’s [operations manual].” Thus, a franchising company, Civility Experts Worldwide (“Civility”), sued an independent business, Molly Manners, LLC (“Molly Manners”), alleging that Molly Manners infringed upon Civility’s copyrights with regards to three lessons used to teach manners to children. Civility alleged there was a “breach of the settlement agreement, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, copyright infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising.”To settle a dispute prior to this litigation, the parties had agreed, in 2013, that Molly Manners would remove all references to Civility’s materials; however, Molly Manners could keep materials that were explicitly licensed to Molly Manners. In this case, though, two parties, touted for their dedication to civility, good manners, and candor, could not come to an agreement. In fact, as time progressed any kind of “civility” between the parties broke down. Molly Manners moved for summary judgment on all claims stating that it adhered to the 2013 settlement agreement when it “modified its teacher guides and materials.”Civility could have proven its copyright infringement claim through either direct or indirect evidence.Proving its claim by direct evidence required Civility to “witness [the] physical act of copying.” This could be accomplished if an employee or agent of Civility saw Molly Manners reproduce Civility’s work firsthand. See, e.g., Rupert M. Barkoff, Implementing Change in a Franchise SystemEWSL. (May 2011).  Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp, 472 U.S. 585, 605 & n.32 (1985).  167 F.

It also could be proven if (1) a contact of Civility saw Molly Manners reproduce one of Civility’s lessons during the drafting, editing, or publishing phase, or (2) even without such a witness, Molly Manners had simply copied a particular lesson verbatim and without any form of originality. Civility could also have corroborated its infringement claim indirectly: this required evidence that “[Molly Manners] had access to the copyrighted work and there were ‘probative similarities between the copyright material and the allegedly copied material.’” The court held that, as a matter of law, similarities between Civility’slessons in Macaroni and Please and Molly Manners’ Nice is Right cannot be “an original selection of subjects . . . [because any set of lessons covering] manners and etiquette, especially one aimed at children, will likely [overlap and are therefore] nes  faire Due to the customary mandates of etiquette, “[t]he fact that Molly Manners’ lesson guides contain the same selection of topics, among others, was thus not an appropriate element [for imputing liability under a copyright infringement claim].”Despite the overlap in lesson content, the court found that the evidence showed that Molly Manners engaged in behaviors that were ill-fitting – indeed, unbecoming(!) - of a business that purported to teach good manners and civility. Specifically, according to the court, there was “overwhelming evidence that Molly Manners … copied from Civility[.]” However, even though there was sufficient evidence in the partial record, the court granted Molly Manners’ motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the copyright infringement claim, finding that no reasonable jury could conclude that Molly Manners’ fragmented literal similarity constituted substantial similarity to Civility’s work as a whole. The court acknowledged that Molly Manners succeeded in “intentionally [copying and] rework[ing] Civility’s[l]essons[,]” but noted that the nonfictional nature of the work left the amount of core protectable expression relatively small. Though the court granted Molly Manners’partial summary judgment on the copyright issue, the court did not grant judgment on the allegations of contract breach because Molly Manners may have failed to adhere to good faith  For a court deciding on probative similarities, it determines whether, “as a factual matter” it is “more likely than not that the defendant copied from the plaintiff’s work.” Civility Experts Worldwide, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 1190 (citing Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chem. Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823, 832 (10th Cir. 1993)). Civility Experts Worldwide, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 1196. Scènes à faire is a French term incorporated into copyright law that states certain creative work is not protectable because it is ordinary, mandated, or customary to a particular genre. See, e.g.DeBitetto v. Alpha Books, 7 F. Supp. 2d 330, 334 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (offering a complementary definition of scènes à faire as “elements of work that necessarily result from its subject matter or ideas”); see also infra note 200.  Civility Experts Worldwide, 167 F. Supp. 3d at 1200.   at 1216. at 1215, 1217.  Id. at 1215.  and fair dealing, a concept at the heart of many franchise contract disputes.Incredibly, even though the court acknowledged that with a fully-developed record, Civility could demonstrate that Molly Manners sought to intentionally copy, rework, and sell its material, the court still granted Molly Manners partial summary judgment on the merits of the copyright infringement claim. In essence, this case instructs us that when merely factual processes are developed, although they may be creative, the nonfiction nature of these works ordinarily fall under 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) and are typically devoid of protection. That is, copyright protections will only apply to those aspects of the work that “display the stamp of the author’s originality.”So, what is a franchisor to do if its proprietary methods and operations are disclosed? What recourse is at hand if the source of a franchise network’s success was revealed to the outside world? To assist the parties and policymakers in dealing with the aftermath of a damaging disclosure, this Article addresses, among other matters, three potential solutions, found in (1) the operations manual, (2) trade secrets law, and (3) antitrust law. While the dispute between Civility and Molly Manners ultimately was decided on the court’s analysis of U.S. copyright law, the case has strong connections to additional forms of intellectual property, such as trade secrets. Molly Manners harmed competition in a way that would prevent other businesses from competing with one another; that is, the court failed to assert, openly, that Molly Manners had stolen her competition’s product instead of finding legitimate ways to compete with its competition. This article aims to show throughout how the case could have been decided differently if Civility had acted more aggressively (rapidly Id. at 1216 (noting that the covenant requires more than simply avoiding copyright infringement).

History Franchising, though not initially known by that name, has historic roots in feudalism and licensing grants from kings. American franchising gained its footing in the mid-1800s through brewer-licensed beer gardens, the Isaac Merrit Singer sewing machine firm, General Motors, and Rexall Drugs. Many industries use franchising as a distribution system where agency roles are determined by contract, though the legalities took time to develop. The modern franchise did not arise until roughly 1935 when Howard Johnson created the first modern restaurant franchise, approximately forty years after the passage of the first antitrust laws.     Following World War II, franchising’s popularity exploded. In 1962, the International Franchise Association estimated that over 400 companies in at least eighty different industries granted franchise rights to over 100,000 people. Accordingly, even if Congress considered franchising when drafting past antitrust laws, the antitrust law discussion is unlikely to have heavily considered implications in the franchising context. Thus, in a time where the franchise market is expected to outpace other sectors in the economy, it is appropriate to modify antitrust laws for franchises. Franchisors have argued that they should be immune from the U.S. antitrust laws, but the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected the argument and continues to apply  Robert W.

Furthermore, the burden should not be placed entirely upon the judicial branch to modernize antitrust laws.

Furthermore, most judges have their careers founded in the criminal arena, which requires a vastly different analysis than a civil litigation or business suit.Operations Manuals: Examples and ElaborationsFunctions of the Operations ManualThe operations manual  serves an important function as the means by which a franchisor can alter the franchise operations without having to re-execute the franchise agreement. Franchise systems must maintain considered as a single entity for competition law considerations). “Antitrust law’s concern is whether the alleged conspirators (e.g., a franchisor and a franchisee or two franchisees) are a single entity – whether the alleged ‘contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy’ [between the franchise parties] is concerted action—that is, whether it joins together separate decisionmakers. The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether there is a ‘contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy’ amongst ‘separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,’ such that the agreement ‘deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,’ and therefore of ‘diversity of entrepreneurial interests,’ and thus of actual or potential competition.” Am.

This motivates the popularity of the Court of Chancery in Delaware, which is a court that is predominately composed of business-literate individuals.

Without this ability, franchise agreements could be voided by changes in regulations, thus resulting in only short term agreements to allow for adaptability, which would likely affect franchise stability. In franchise agreements, franchisors will take initial steps to safeguard the right to alter the operations manual and—hence—franchise operations in general. Thus, the modifiable operations manual is the best approach for a franchisor to remain adaptable.  For example, template modification provisions exist: “Any part . . ., services, and products may in good faith be further developed, improved, changed, and modified by the Company from time to time. However, any such changes may not materially alter the economic and other terms of this agreement unless consented to in writing by franchiseeHowever, a natural conflict arises. When a franchisee signs the franchise agreement, she believes she is contracting for a certain system or operation. But there are situations where a franchisee is in fact subject to terms over which there was no  bargaining or even sufficient information. When the franchisor is able to unilaterally change the operations manual, something that is almost always a franchisor power, bullying of the franchisee may result. Several states thus have enacted legislation allowing franchisees to rescind the  McLaughlin v. Krystal Co, No. 08-0611-CG-C, 2009 WL 2514210 , at *7 (S.D. Ala.

The FDDs covered all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems. The Author found that over 90% of those franchise networks (462 of them) expressly provide to their franchisor the sole discretion to amend the operations manual; franchise contract clauses specifically acknowledge the franchisor’s right to exercise broad discretion, while specifically stating that the exercise of such discretion would not breach an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See Bagdon, supra note 48 (describing the threat that franchisees face at the hands of franchisor’s broad discretion); see also Tiffany Hsu & Rachel Abrams, Subway got too big. Franchisees paid a Price., N.Y.IMES (June 28, 2019), franchise agreement in response to drastic changes. The franchise system is traditionally franchisor-friendly, so it is important that franchisees are able to defend themselves. Thus, for example, laws should enable franchisees to resist a material change to the operations manual. In many franchise contracts, this would almost always be acceptable as “solely within the franchisor’s discretion.” Those considerable changes to the manual, though, should only be permissible under reasonable circumstances.The operations manual discusses key business concepts, such as what products may be sold, franchisee advertising capabilities, franchise color schemes, required hours of operation, employee uniforms, and other intricate business details. Traditionally, franchisees are bound by the operations manual. In other words, following the terms of the operational manual is not a choice, but a requirement. This mandate makes sense because a major attraction to the franchise business model is uniformity. For instance, a traveling consumer in an unfamiliar location can remain comfortable about her product expectations for McDonald’s because company standards are uniform across the entire country.  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/business/subway-franchisees.html (describing various tactics Subway used to bully its franchisees after 2015, causing many franchisees to fail to recoup their investments and close down, including a provision in the Franchise Agreement that allows Subway (as franchisor) the discretion to revise its rules “at any time during the term of [the] Franchise Agreement under any condition and to any extent.”). see Scott N.

See supra note 53 (discussing the “discretion” language found in 462 of 500 FDDs that the Author examined).

See Susser v. Carvel Corp, 206 F. Supp. 636, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 1962). It is vital to include these in the operations manual because the information inside the manual can be protected as confidential.

Therefore, the alteration of an operations manual requires balancing a franchisor’s need to adapt to the franchisee’s expectation of stability. Some jurisdictions, such as Connecticut, Hawaii, and New Jersey, prohibit unreasonable standards in the franchise operations manual.If a franchisor has reserved the right to modify the manual unilaterally, policy considerations must counter that right with a reasonableness standard. In Norway, for instance, appellate courts have noted the importance of considering a change’s effect on a franchisee. This balancing protection is based entirely on Norway’s judicially created laws, which still respect contractual rights. Indeed, at least two cases involving unilateral changes have resulted in a ruling in favor of franchisors.When addressing changes in an operations manual, courts also consider whether a change is material. Generally, courts do not allow the unilateral imposition of material changes. For example, a franchisor would be unable to alter a loyalty program or increase a fee beyond what is in the franchise agreement.

Another example is if the operations manual imposed an expensive remodeling requirement that was not stated in the franchise agreement, nor disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Document (“FDD”). Miller, supra note 65. However, if a franchisor allowed a franchisee to purchase and use equipment that met the franchisor’s specifications but then mandated a specific system, the franchisor could unilaterally impose an equipment change without obtaining franchisee approval. One consideration is the specificity of the franchise agreement. For example, did the agreement specify that the change at issue was possible? If so, a court will likely allow the change.The Process for Altering a Franchise Operations Manual The process for implementing changes to a franchise’s operations manual varies among jurisdictions. For example, in California, a franchisor must notify franchisees by recording any material changes within a certain period of time in order for a modification to be effective, assuming the franchisees accepted the changes.Generally, material changes require both parties to agree to the new terms and can also require additional consideration to make the modification enforceable. On the other hand, a non-material change follows a less burdensome procedure. For instance, a franchisor may change a supplier or condiment arrangement by simply modifying the operations manual and providing franchisees with notice via a letter or email.The franchisor may impose her own limitations on the modifications, but notice is required, and such modifications require good faith. The good faith and fair dealing requirement is typically implied in all contracts and requires that all parties “exercise that discretion reasonably and with proper motive, and may not  Bores v.

The term consideration creates a new wave of concerns. For example, is a continued relationship consideration for additional terms? Some jurisdictions view a continued employment relationship sufficient to impose a non-disclosure or non-compete agreement after the employment has begun. See Signature Style, Inc. v. Roseland, 2020 WL 58456, at *5–6 (D. Neb. Jan. 6, 2020); see also ADP, LLC v. Pittman, No. 19-16237, 2019 WL 5304148, at *2, *11–12 (D.N.J. Oct. 18, 2019).

This limitation gives franchisees a chance to challenge a franchisor’s unilateral modifications to the operations manual resulting in financial detriment to franchisees. In application, for a franchisor to alter the terms of an operations manual, it should have an economic or business reason for making the change; it cannot do so on a whim. Unfortunately for franchisees, proving a good faith violation is not an easy burden to meet. For example, if a franchisor decides to increase franchisees’ supply pricing, such a change is unlikely to constitute a violation of the implied covenant. Indeed, countervailing express contract terms would prevail.. How to Avoid Litigation: Delineating Discretion, Confidentiality, and Agency The best way for a franchisee to combat potential abuse is to bargain for fewer opportunities for the franchisor to make unilateral changes. Franchise agreement negotiations would be exceptionally difficult for a franchisee with very little experience, and most franchisees generally have little bargaining power since a franchisor could likely find another franchisee. This is often true in more established franchises with national brand recognition. In fact, franchise agreements are often designed in a way that allows the franchisor to enter into a contract with multiple franchisees without having to tailor the contract to each party. Furthermore, many prospective franchisees do not consult an attorney to review the terms of the franchise agreement.Legal assistance would be well advised for franchisees because franchise agreements are typically considered enforceable so long as they are not unconscionable, deceptive, or against public policy.

When it comes to business and franchise, confidential information and trade secrets are often the most valuable company assets.However, a current or former franchisee may leak information from the manual to competitors or use the information after the franchise agreement termination. This information makes the franchise successful and unique. Business materials or trade secrets may contain information about “ingredients, cooking and preparation techniques, store equipment” and more. Therefore, it is essential to the success of a franchise to keep this knowledge confidential. When no statute directly regulates confidentiality and trade secrecy, the common law governs these issues, which franchisors have successfully used to obtain injunctions preventing further use of confidential material.The manual can also serve as evidence of an agency link between a franchisor and its franchisees.Traditionally, franchisees are viewed more along the lines of an independent contractor with respect to unconscionability is . . . dependent by reference to: (1) the relative benefit of the bargain to the parties at the time of its making; (2) the nature of the methods employed in negotiating it; and (3) the relative bargaining power of the parties.”).

McDonald’s Corp., 945 P.2d 1107, 1110–11 (Or. Ct. App. 1997) (determining that a jury could find that McDonald’s “retained sufficient control over the [franchisee’s] daily operations [such] that an actual agency relationship existed.”). determining liability. However, franchisees have argued that because the franchise is controlled by the franchisor’s requirements that the franchisors should also be liable. A franchisee does not have much choice in whether to strictly adhere to the operating manual and other franchisor requirements because the franchisee risks the franchise agreement being terminated if the franchisor’s operating manual and other requirements are not followed. It is foreseeable that a franchisee’s compliance with the operating manual could lead to a person being injured. Courts view an extensive amount of control as sufficient to overcome the independent contractor status and impose franchisor liability for franchisee actions. For example, in Miller v. McDonald’s Corp the court held that a jury could find an agency relationship between franchisee and franchisor where the latter provided “methods for inventory control, bookkeeping procedures, business practices, and other management, advertising, and personnel policies” to which the franchisee must adhere.This extensive control, as provided for in the operations manual, creates another obstacle for franchisors to overcome. If the manual gives the franchisor control over day-to-day operations, it can result in vicarious liability for franchisee actions. In contrast, providing extremely detailed protocols for food preparation, hygiene, and sanitation may not establish this agency link. Courts seem to be more receptive towards accepting provisions in manuals that establish brand standards rather than provisions that delve into the  As this is the “traditional” view, consider the oldest version of the Restatement of Torts. RESTATEMENT IRST OF ORTS 1934)(“Except as stated in §§ 410 to 429, the employer of an independent contractor [a franchisee] is not subject to liability for bodily harm caused to another by a tortious act or omission of the contractor or his servants.”). Franchise agreements typically declare that the parties acknowledge the franchisee is an independent contractor and that the franchisee is  an agent for the principal. Emerson, supra note 53, at 697 (finding 74% of 100 franchise contracts in 2013 contained such an acknowledgment).

Western Sizzlin Corp, 857 So. 2d 71, 77 (Ala. 2003)(stating that a franchise agreement alone is not enough to make a franchisee an agent of the franchisor). Some courts give weight to situations where the franchisor “control[s] the time and manner of executing the work, as distinguished from the right merely to require results in conformity to the contract.” New Star Realty v. Jungang PRI USA, LLC, 816 S.E.2d 501, 508 (Ga. Ct. App. 2018) (referring to those factors as the “historical test”). Schlotzsky’s Inc. v. Hyde, 538 S.E.2d 561, 562 (Ga. Ct.

Franchisors may be better suited at labeling an operations manual as a “Brand Standards Manual,” which suggests the purpose is to preserve franchise goodwill and to protect the brand. Compliance should be emphasized in the franchise agreement to avoid issues of control.Unfortunately, there are no clear rules to delineate how much or what types of control a franchisor may exert without creating an agency link. For now, agency tests are determined primarily through case law.   D. Independent Contractor Statutes: No Panacea for Liability Issues Some U.S. jurisdictions have gone beyond common law to create “Independent Contractor Statutes,” which help courts determine whether a controlled party, such as a franchisee, is an independent contractor or agent. Unfortunately, for vicarious liability or other issues, these statutes often fail to provide much guidance. So, too, courts in the United Kingdom take a similar approach: if a franchisee commits a tort, a franchisor may be liable because the franchisee is a partner or agent of the franchisor because: (1) the franchisee agrees that it will (a) provide work in exchange for a payment and (b) be subject to the franchisor’s control; and (2) other provisions make the contract appear to be an employment arrangement. These factors are not likely to be present in a franchising relationship, so an employee classification or general agency relationship is also unlikely. In summation, an operations manual must be carefully crafted if it is to keep the franchisor safe from unnecessary liability.See Susan A. Grueneberg et al., Drafting Franchise Agreements After Patterson v. Domino’s: Avoiding the Minefield of Vicarious Liability and Joint Employment, 36 FRANCHISE L.J. 189, 198 (2016).  Id.  See Font v.

The Lanham Act and the Limitations of Copyright . The Lanham Act: An Avenue for Relief Civilitya successful trademark registration could have prevented litigation. Civility Experts Worldwide would have been able to justifiably pursue remedies relating to trademark infringement under the Lanham Act. Under this Act, a trademark owner may register its trademark by paying a fee and filling out an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The owner must also submit a verified statement specifying that the person making the verification believes she is the owner of the mark being registered. In most cases, the trademark owner is the sole owner of the trademark; in situations where there are multiple registrants or owners, they are specified in the verified statement. In Civility v. Molly Manners Civility could have registered a specific phrase or lesson that was commonly used, thus preventing Molly Manners from being able to use those phrases or lessons. Further, Civility could have included a disclaimer within its operations manual stating which phrases belonged exclusively to Civility.  . A Brief Overview of Copyright Law and its Applicable Protections A copyright, as a form of intellectual property law, grants legal protection to original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression, from which that work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated exclusively by the copyright owner, absent a licensing agreement. Simply put, a copyright holder can prevent others from copying that work. Although it is not required for one to copyright their work, doing so is highly recommended because registration is a prerequisite for recovering damages in a federal copyright infringement case. Various statutes, including the U.S. Copyright Act, provide examples of what types of works can be copyrighted. Franchisors can copyright illustrations, creative ads, toys, and other creative works in tangible form, thereby preventing franchisees from copying those and any derivative works without a proper licensing agreement; in short, a franchisor is authorized to take actions against infringement and receive monetary or equitable remedies. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051, 1065–66, 1071 (2018). Id. § 1051(a)(1).  15 U.S.C. § 1052(d) (2018).  167 F. Supp. 3d 1179 (D. Colo. 2016).  17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (2018).  17 U.S.C. § 412 (2018) (excluding authors of visual art, as described in § 106A). 17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a)(1)–(8) (2018).  Note that a variety of legal actions that involve copyright may require the registration of the copyright. However, this can be done after the infringement has occurred. Id. § 411(a) (2018) (stating “no civil action” may be brought “until pre-registration or registration” is complete); Julia C. Colarusso et al., Intellectual Property for Franchisors in the USAEXOLOGYhttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=c7 6d64c9-e880-4df4-8d4d-2ddafe6487d6 (last visited Feb. 28, 2021) (mentioning different ways for franchisors to protect their intellectual property, including through registration). The law also provides that “[i]n no case does copyright protection . . . extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, [or] method of operation . . . regardless of the form.”  This serves as the metaphorical nail in the coffin for franchisors attempting to rely on copyright registration as the exclusive form of intellectual property protection for their processes. Regardless of how creative a franchisor’s cooking procedures are, if someone “reverse engineers” the procedure, then the franchisor cannot rely on copyright protection.Attempts to Expand Copyright Law Protections Individuals, not necessarily franchisors, have tried to expand the bounds of copyright law. For example, an attempt to have copyright law recognize “sweat equity” for a compilation of factual information including phone numbers, addresses, and alphabetically listed names failed because the respondent did not organize the factual information in an original way. Congress has also tried to extend the time limit for copyright protection, with supporters arguing that an extension was necessary to keep special work product from becoming part of the public domain. This argument ultimately failed because the U.S. Supreme Court rejected any large-scale substantive expansion of copyright concepts beyond what Constitutional framers initially intended. As evidence for this proposition, detractors pointed to the simple fact that copyrights are only allowed to exist for fixed periods of time. Though becoming more modern, copyright law is still evolving. For example, courts have agreed that computer programs are copyrightable despite being no more than a very complex process.Despite this small victory, neither courts nor legislatures have budged regarding the copyrightability of non-coding-related processes. The U.S. Supreme Court has often stated that there is no reason to extend terms beyond achieving uniformity on an international level. Thus, franchisors need another body of law to  17 U.S.C. § 102(b) (2018) (these types of intellectual property are typically protected by patents or claims of trade secrecy).  One of the earliest cases involved an attempt to copyright a rather “creative” accounting process. However, the Supreme Court determined that the process was not copyrightable. See Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 100–02, 107 (1879).  Feist Publ’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., Inc, 499 U.S. 340, 359–60 (1991) (“Originality, not ‘sweat of the brow,’ is the touchstone of copyright protection”).   Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 193–98 (recounting the history of the Nation’s first copyright statute). In reviewing the “limited times” restriction in the Constitution’s Copyright Clause, the Court in Eldred rejected a challenge to Congressional extension of how long an owner’s copyright lasts (20 additional years), not a matter of expanding the substantive reach of copyright.

Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823, 836–38, 841–42 (10th Cir. 1993) (making a distinction between elements that are protectable and those that are not, and vacating the copyright infringement action, but noting that “a coherent approach to the protectability analysis” in terms of the copyrightability of computer programs has been discussed in other cases).  Lessig, supra note 128; see also Golan v. Holder, 565 U.S. 302, 329 (2012) (stating “Congress adopted measures to ease the transition from a national scheme to an international copyright regime” when describing 17 U.S.C. §§ 104A(c), (d), and (h)).  protect their secret information that provides an economic advantage over any competitors. This combination perfectly sets the stage for trade secrets.  IV.  Making or Taking Trade SecretsA typical trade secret is information that a person or entity does not want to be known by others, especially those within the same commercial industry. It extends further to business-related information, which can give the business a competitive advantage because trade secrets can include formulas, patterns, programs, devices, techniques, and processes. Trade secret protection is viewed as a last resort if other forms of intellectual property law fail to offer legal protection for the information. It lives in the purgatory of intellectual property: a realm in which intellectual property contains elements from the public domain while still remaining protected as unique and original ideas.The hybrid nature of trade secret law is essential in the franchising context. When other forms of intellectual property protection are not available, a franchisor can rely on trade secrecy so long as the information is actually a secret, the franchisor has made reasonable efforts to preserve the information’s secrecy, the information alleged to be a trade secret has sufficient independent economic value, and the information at issue in the trade secret context is stated with reasonable particularity. However, public policy dictates that information considered to be generally known or readily ascertainable does not qualify for trade secret protection. Perhaps the most famous example of trade secrecy involves Coca Cola’s secret formula for its soda products. When originally created, the formula was never written down, and only a small number of individuals knew the formula, mostly due to the highly proprietary nature and because the formula  Note the actual operations manual can be copyrighted since the manual is fixed and tangible and the words and arrangement are creative.

Similarly, if a franchisor were to create an extremely efficient method to operate its kitchen, a copyright could not be used to protect that process. Additionally, if a franchisor discovered that individuals respond positively to a certain advertising technique, that information is not protected through copyright. Fortunately, trade secret protection is an avenue that can provide the desired intellectual property protection. The Intersection between Franchises and Trade Secret Law  Franchisors strive to protect confidential information and procedures from leaking to their competitors, which may pertain to a franchisee’s or franchisor’s operations. For this reason, franchisors are interested and heavily invested in protecting the information given to prospective franchisees. Some examples of this information include product mix reports, marketing plans, or other franchising materials. Other examples of information the franchisors desires to protect include customer lists, financial information, marketing and sales information, distribution techniques, recipes, and business plans. In the event that a franchisee fails to protect these secrets, the franchisor will have a misappropriation claim.  Misappropriation of a trade secret is a common law tort action that encompasses the acquisition of a trade secret by someone who knows it was improperly obtained, or obtained without the appropriate consent.Traditionally, a misappropriation claim has three elements: (1) the existence of a trade secret; (2) the acquisition of the trade secret as a result of a confidential relationship; (3) the unauthorized use of the trade secret. A misappropriation claim does not arise in the event of independent invention, including reverse engineering, and can be preempted by state trade secrets statutes.Take the recent case of Handel’s Enterprises, Inc. v. Schulenburg in which a current franchisee was enjoined from operating a competing business based on misappropriation of the franchisor’s trade secrets. The court found that the current franchisee, which operated a franchise at one location, opened a competing ice The Secret is Out: Coca-Cola’s Formula is at the World of Coca-ColaOLA .

If Civility had been able to demonstrate the steps taken to safeguard its processes, materials, and information, and if Civility also demonstrated the information provided an economic advantage, Civility may have had a claim under the UTSA or the DTSA. UTSA and DTSA: Viable Solutions to Civility’s Trade Secrets Misappropriation Claim The UTSA attempts to provide uniformity among the different states with respect to trade secret protections. It is “the primary source of trade secret law in the United States.” Under the UTSA, a trade secret is defined as “information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process[.]” Trade secret protection is only granted when the individual seeking trade secret protection derives actual or potential economic value from what is not available to its competitors. A key cornerstone of trade secrets is that they must be secret However, information does not receive trade secret Id. at 123. Id.  Id. at 124.  18 U.S.C. § 1836 (2016).

In the absence of secrecy the property disappears.”). This is so “because the ‘intrinsic value’ of a trade secret ‘is based upon, or at least preserved by, being safeguarded from disclosure.’” Amgen, Inc. v. Health Care Servs., 260 Cal. Rptr. 3d 873, 886 (Cal. Ct. App. 2020) (citations omitted).status if the information is readily ascertainable by competitors. That is, when information is so conspicuous that any reasonable individual could have access to it, the UTSA does not provide trade secret protection. Conceptually, this principle is clear — information that is accessible by all is not a secret and is not exclusively within the rights of one particular person or entity. To maintain a trade secret, the party seeking protection must make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to protect the information – reasonable efforts do not require an “extreme and unduly expensive procedure[] . . . to protect trade secrets.” Courts may also consider additional factors, such as “sweat equity.” Other methods a franchisor can take to preserve the secrecy of trade secrets are to explicitly define them within the operations manual and to mandate strict compliance within the franchise agreement. It is imperative that the franchisor state that the items listed in the franchise agreement are licensed to the franchisee as opposed to being sold.Proving a claim under the UTSA requires three elements: (1) the subject matter must qualify for trade secret protection; (2) the holder of the subject matter must establish that reasonable precautions were taken to prevent disclosure of the subject matter, and (3) the trade secret holder must prove that the information was misappropriated or wrongfully taken. Successful plaintiffs can obtain monetary damages, an injunction, or both. In addition to damages and injunctive relief, the prevailing party may also obtain attorney’s fees under the UTSA if a misappropriation claim was made in bad faith, a motion to terminate an injunction is filed in bad faith or is ignored, or there is willful or malicious misappropriation.As an additional mechanism for uniformity in trade secrecy, Congress enacted the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) in 2016 with the express purpose of providing standard guidance for the courts.

DTSA was enacted, a party suing for trade secret misappropriation was limited to state court unless there was federal diversity jurisdiction. State laws about trade secret misappropriation vary from state to state, but DTSA provides a nationwide statute that can be applied in federal court. Thus, DTSA provides an “additional tool for American companies, especially those with a national footprint, to enforce their intellectual property rights.” Though litigants pursuing misappropriation claims can now bring suit at the federal level, trade secret law is still largely governed by state trade secret law because the DTSA does not preempt state law remedies for misappropriation. Nevertheless, plaintiffs can now bring misappropriation claims in federal or state court. Similar to the UTSA, the DTSA allows a prevailing party in trade secret litigation to be awarded attorney’s fees in civil actions, subject to court discretion.The DTSA is modeled after the UTSA, and was enacted as an amendment to the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996. Both the DTSA and UTSA require proving that the subject matter qualifies for trade secret protection as the first element of any trade secret claim. The DTSA provides a narrower definition for what type of information qualifies as a trade secret than the UTSA because the DTSA has an exhaustive definition for what constitutes protected material. Conversely, the UTSA only provides guidance as to what constitutes a trade secret. Although both laws provide broad definitions, the DTSA provides a list of items that are trade secrets – exhaustive and specifically defined – related directly to commerce. Bret A. Cohen et al., Explaining the Defend Trade Secrets Act, 2016 BODAY 1, 1 (2016). Id.

The second element for a misappropriation claim under both the UTSA and DTSA is that the information is “subject to efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.” Put simply, the holder of the trade secret has the burden of providing notice of the confidential nature of the information to all parties to whom the trade secret is disclosed. The amount of protection required varies from industry to industry. In some instances, a “reasonable effort” is simply to have the parties sign a non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”), which provides a contractual obligation to protect trade secrets and serves as notice to the employee or possessor of the secret that the information must be protected. It may also be in the franchisor’s best interest to have all parties involved in the franchise sign a NDA. For example, franchisors should require not only franchisees to sign NDAs, but also any managers that the franchisee entrusts with the trade secrets. NDA provisions maintained within franchise agreements should be supported by identified trade secrets not “only generally, but more specifically in the operations manual” as a preventative measure.franchisor may also provide these individuals with just parts of the trade secret so that no one person has the entire secret. Further, the NDA can require signees to maintain secrecy even after the business relationship has ended.If a former employee was given access to a virtual database, the ex-employer must now make efforts to See Richard F. Dole, Jr., Identifying the Trade Secrets at Issue in Litigation Under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the Federal Defend Trade Secrets Act, 33 SANTA LARA IGH L.J. 470, 474 (2017). This is a requirement in both the UTSA and the DTSA, despite the DTSA having different language regarding this requirement. Compare UTSA § 1(4)(ii) (1985) (“efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy”), with 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3)(A) (2016) (“taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret”).

Similarly, if a former employee was given physical property containing trade secrets, it would also be in the ex-employer’s best interest to recover that property. In fact, franchisees often continue using trade secrets after the franchise agreement is no longer valid. In Nova Scotia Ltd. v. Donna’s Seashore Investments Ltd., the defendant’s franchise was terminated, and the franchisor sued because of the continued use of its trade secrets. The Civility case had a similar situation because Molly Manners originally used the Civility materials in accordance with its license, but incorporated portions of Civility’s materials into its own programs.Courts have long spoken of the multiple elements of a trade secret: A trade secret can “exist in a combination of characteristics and components, each of which, by itself, is in the public domain, but the unified process, design and operation of which, in unique combination, affords a competitive advantage and is a protectable secret.” For instance, a court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Coca-Cola on all counts of a trade secret misappropriation claim for an embossed label because of independent development by proper means based on information that was partially disclosed in a patent application. Though the court noted that independent creation or reverse engineering does not constitute misappropriation, it reaffirmed the principle that trade secrets can exist in a combination of components. The Civility case raises a novel issue with respect to how franchises can use intellectual property laws to protect their information. While copyright and trademark law offer remedies for franchisors regarding how to protect their intellectual property, the question here is whether intellectual property laws will protect secret information when they are part of the franchise’s operational procedure – that is, whether trade secret law will protect secrets stolen from franchisors or disseminated to the public in violation of a NDA.

The distinction of outcomes, based on contract law versus tort law, can be vital. For example, in Williams-Sonoma Direct, Inc. v. Arhaus LLC a trade secret dispute based in contract law, the court found in favor of the plaintiff for claims of misappropriation because the defendant utilized proprietary information for financial gain, which was obtained from plaintiff’s former high level employee that was subject to an NDA specifically detailing the confidential information and other protective measures. In another contract claim involving disclosure of trade secrets despite a valid NDA contract, the court dismissed the case because the plaintiff did not take reasonable steps to maintain secrecy of its plan to develop bubblegum packaging in a wheel design. Specifically, the court took issue with plaintiff’s failure to designate information as “confidential” in accordance with the terms of the NDA. While trade secret misappropriation claims may have a higher chance of success when a NDA contract is involved, there are some instances in which tortious misconduct in the absence of a NDA can be successful. For instance, the court in PMC, Inc. v. Kadisha held that a corporate officer could be liable for intentional tortious conduct if the officer invested in a corporation who’s intellectual property assets (i.e. trade secrets) were knowingly obtained through unlawful conduct and the officer investing with the intent to use the unlawfully obtained information for economic gain. Another example of tortious misconduct in trade secret misappropriation claims may arise after a contract has been terminated, but one party creates a defective adaption of a product subject to trade secret protection such that reputational damage results. In essence, the difference between misappropriation in contract disputes as opposed to tort disputes is not a defendant’s alleged bad acts, which exist in both instances, but is instead the existence of—and adherence to—a NDA contract. There are lessons to be learned from Civility Experts. Had Civility included a NDA as a condition of franchising and receiving a copy of its operations manual, Civility may have had a claim under trade secrets ATRICK USTONAW OF RADE ECRET EGULATION UNDER THE NIFORM RADE ECRETS 32 (2d ed. 2020) (citing cases for the proposition that trade secret status under nondisclosure or noncompete agreements – i.e., information qualifying as a trade secret in such contract-based cases - may not constitute a trade secret under noncontractual claims, such as those found under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act). 109 F.

However, barring those circumstances, it is unlikely that Civility would have a remedy under intellectual property laws—seeing as the court stated that Civility was ineligible for copyright protections.Civility claimed that the processes it developed with its material was protected by copyright law—that the processes were original works of authorship. The court disagreed and stated that developing lessons for manners is not original, but rather, something that is well-known and not creative – scènes à faireFollowing the United States’ example, in 2016 the European Union created trade secret laws called the Trade Secrets Directive (“TSD”). The TSD was aimed at unifying the laws related to trade secrets. The TSD defines trade secret by stating[I]t is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question; it has commercial value because it is secret; it has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret.” This definition of trade secret is the same as the 1994 WTO TRIPS definition of trade secret. It is relatively the same as the definition for Denmark, Spain and Italy, but it changes the definition more in countries like UK, Germany, Sweden, Poland and Hungry. Note that trade secret law would not likely support a claim regarding information actually told to the various workshop participants. The information does provide an economic advantage, but the information is not reasonably protected. For example, someone interested in developing a manners workshop would simply attend the workshop to learn Civility’s material. However, trade secret protection could extend to certain teaching approaches in treating workshop participants and other information that is reasonably protected. Another possible example would be to have all attendees sign a nondisclosure agreement, which may be hard to do since Civility’s target audience is children.  Civility Experts Worldwide v.

As one author explains:   [The TSD is a] so-called “minimum harmonisation device” meaning that Member States have the possibility--if they wish--to put in place wider trade secret protection, provided that the safeguard measures expressly provided for in the Directive to protect the interests of third parties are respected. However, even if a Member State does not put such protection in place, pursuant to Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the wording and the goals of the Directive must be observed when national law is applied.Kevin Nachtrab, The Trade Secrets Directive, 54 LES OUVELLES 165, 165 (2019), https://www.lesi.org/publications/les-nouvelles/les-nouvelles-online/september-2019; see also UNDAMENTALS OF RANCHISING UROPE 36 (Robert A.

UNDAMENTALS OF RANCHISING UROPE 36 (Robert A. Lauer & John Pratt, eds., 2017).     Not only does the TSD create a uniform policy for trade secret management in the European Union, but it also defines unlawful acquisition and remedies, though criminalization for misuse of trade secrets is not a possibility. Similar to trade secret protection in the United States, the TSD provides for a cause of action when a confidentiality agreement or NDA has been breached. Under article 4(3), the TSD specifically provides that use or disclosure will be considered unlawful when: “[W]ithout the consent of the trade secret holder . . . a person . . . is found to meet any of the following conditions: (a) [to have] acquired the trade secret unlawfully; (b) [to be] in breach of a confidentiality agreement or any other duty not to disclose the trade secret; [or] (c) [to be] in breach of a contractual or any other duty to limit the use of the trade secret.”Successful litigants are offered various remedies, including injunctions; prohibitions on production, marketing, and sale of infringing goods; seizure or delivery of infringing goods, including electronic information;       court-ordered recalls, alterations, or destruction; publicized judgments; and reverse engineering.On the other hand, trade secret law under both the UTSA and the DTSA provide intellectual property protection for both individuals and businesses who develop proprietary procedures. This means if a business takes well known information to develop a process and creates economic gain from this process, both the UTSA and the DTSA provide trade secret protection and a remedy for misappropriation. Here, it is likely that under the UTSA or DTSA, Civility would have had a remedy against Molly Manners. The information was not known to its competitors, the information provided Civility with a competitive advantage, and the NDA was a reasonable step to protect the information. Civility would be entitled to breach of contract damages, royalties, injunctions, and other remedies that the court may find appropriate. Other remedies may include attorney’s fees if the misappropriation was made in bad faith. Council Directive 2016/943, arts.4(2)-(5), 6(1), 9(1), 12(1)–(4), 14, 16, 2016 O.J.

There is one major hiccup with trade secrets; recall that independent creation voids the trade secret protection, at least with respect to that party. For example, if Molly Manners had no prior contact with Civility and independently came up with the same ideas that Civility used, Civility would not have a misappropriation claim. Independent creation is dangerous to businesses or franchises with secrets that are not necessarily complex or unique. Although marketing strategies and procedures may be creative, they are not always enough to meet the requirements for protection. If franchise processes were public information or the franchisor failed to keep the trade secrets private, a purported misappropriator could simply point to public documents to show that identified trade secrets are not secret at all, thus failing to meet one of the elements required for protection. The defendant and purported misappropriator is able to use its own documents, records, and financial data to show that it made no use of the plaintiff’s information to show there was no misappropriation. Therefore, if a franchisor attempts to protect its processes as trade secrets and another franchisor develops the same idea through its own efforts, the franchisor would not have a legal claim. The Potential of a Trade Secret Registry to Protect Both Franchise Parties Before analyzing the specifics of what a trade secret registry applicable to franchises would look like, it will be helpful to first explore the attributes that should be present to establish the type of registry this article posits could be implemented. The trade secret registry should be an international registry, so as to reflect the international nature of the franchise industry; it should exist in an online format to permit all interested parties ease of access. The purpose of the registry would be to “identify the owners of the trade secret rights . . . but not to disclose the secrets themselves.” An effective trade secret registry will primarily have security measures in place to protect the owner’s asset (the trade secret), while also meeting the public notice requirement (informing the public that a particular idea is protected without revealing proprietary information  Independent creation is a “defense asserting that a later work is not a derivative of an allegedly inferior work, but is a product of coincidentally parallel labor.” Independent CreationLACKICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019); What is independent creation?, http://www.quizlaw.com/trade_secrets/ what_is_independent_creation.php (last visited Feb. 19, 2021) (providing an alternate definition of Independent creation as “where someone creates, on [his/her] own, the same technology or information which someone else claims as a trade secret. If this independent creation did not wrongfully use any part of the claimed trade secret, then the creator is free to use it as he or she sees fit, without needing to seek the trade secret owner’s permission, and is not liable for trade secret misappropriation.”).

This international trade registry will require registered owners to consent to a pre-determined choice of law, so that the registry can operate on uniform procedural and substantive laws, as a precondition for using the registry.

In the event of a security breach, where a third party hacker breaks into the registry and steals deposited trade secrets, various remedies are available: either the registry can be insured with high policy limits and/or the registry can provide an insurance fund (financed by trade secret owner registration fees) to compensate owners for damages. Operators of the registry would be civilly liable to the registered trade secret owners for breach of contract and negligent handling of the registry.Second, an effective trade secret registry for franchises will be judged on reducing various costs: transaction, litigation, financing, and employment costs. As long as a franchise does not conflict with the operating manual terms detailing trade secrets, either a franchisor or franchisee could enter the trade secret information as encrypted information on the registry (saved as a unique file). To ensure the authenticity of ownership, individuals inputting information should sign with an approved electronic signature.Subsequent updates to the initial entry could be made in real time, replacing the file where the original entry is located on the registry. This article recommends that only the individual who inputted the trade secret information into the registry, and his or her agents or subordinates, would be allowed to make updates to that original entry. The registry would allow members of the general public to view the name of various owners, the names of their agents and subordinates who made updates, as well as date and time in which the information was input (or updated) into the registry.  To engage in transaction related to the trade secret, the  Vinizky, supra note217,at 486–87. As with other firms who receive and store consumers’ data, perhaps the FTC could be granted the authority to impose certain obligations on the registry’s registrar and other registry employees to protect the security of consumer provided information while also file enforcement actions against the registrar and his or her employees for failing to provide “reasonable” measures to protect the security of the owner’s trade secret data. See, e.g., Daniel J. Solove & Woodrow Hartzog, The FTC and the new Common law of Privacy, 114 COLUM. 583, 604 (2014); FRADE TART WITH ECURITYUIDE FOR USINESSESSONS EARNED FROM ASES (2015), https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/start-security-guide-business.Id. at 530. Arguably, a trade secret owner’s act of depositing his, her, or its trade secret into an online encrypted trade secret registry satisfy the reasonable secrecy precautions (“RSP”) requirement.  Deepa Varadarajan, Trade Secret Precautions, Possession, and Notice, 68 HASTINGS L.J. 357, 360 (2017). The RSP requirement is a necessary element (under the UTSA and the DTSA) that the trade secret owner must meet to obtain trade secret protection, i.e., the owner must “engage in reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information for which protection is sought.” ; Dole, Jr., supra note 176.  Vinizky, supra note 217,at 530. Id. at 484. Optimally, the registry’s benefits should exceed the costs of establishing and operating the registry, as well as overcome additional public costs (e.g., the means of acquiring initial ownership of the trade secret; the means for transferring ownership of it; and the creation of secondary rights for permitted uses of it). Id. at 484–86. Vinizky, supra note 217, at 488. The information would also need to be encrypted when saved onto the registry. Id. & n.80.   Id. at 488.

Vinizky proposes that there should not be a preliminary ownership verification step before inputting the trade secret into the registry; thus, the registration itself would not constitute as definitive proof that the material is a trade secret. Vinizky, supra note 217, at 493. Further, “[r]egistration of information as a trade secret with the proposed registry [would] not necessarily create the trade secret.” Id. at 496.  registrant would need to list the names of all contracting parties and list the secret on the registry in his/her/its name. Similarly, if either party to a franchise agreement were to transact with each other or with a third party relating to an unregistered trade secret (one not in the registry), then any such transaction would be void until the secret is officially registered in the registry.The registry’s public notice function will be useful in various scenarios. The registry’s public notice aspect can prevent fraudulent transactions, such as when an terminated franchisee attempts to sell his former franchisor’s trade secret to the franchisor’s competitors (and vis versa). Similarly, the registry’s notice function can also assist franchisors in screening potential franchisees who may have access or knowledge about other franchisors’ trade secrets; without performing this check, the current franchisor could be liable for trade secret misappropriation for executing a franchise agreement with a franchisee who possesses knowledge of a former franchisor’s trade secret.The registry can also assist the parties in the franchise relationship by lowering the transaction costs associated with trade secrets litigation. Indeed, in the event of a legal dispute where one party challenges the legitimacy of another party’s ownership of trade secret, the registrar(s) of the trade secrets registry and his or her employees are the only ones that should be allowed to peruse the trade secret to comply with discovery requests or judicial request for the material.  The registrars, along with their employees and the experts they hire, will need to be bound by a duty of confidentiality to the trade secret owner as third party certifiers,similar to the one applicable to a patent registrar and his or her employees.  In addition, depositing a trade secret into the registry clears up issues of when it came into existence (there is a record date); similarly, the trade secret registrar’s certification of what exactly the owner deposited (in general terms) as the trade secret can be used as prima facie evidence regarding the scope of the secret. Similarly, claims of trade secret misappropriation can be filed with ease since the owner of the trade secret can use the registry to identify Id. at 494.

Registration of a trade secret on a proposed registry such as this could be used a litigation proceeding as prima facie evidence of intent to protect a trade secret; absent a showing that the registered secret was well-known or the registrant used reasonable efforts to protect her secret, courts are likely to assume that the registered trade secret was reasonably protected.

Indeed, suppose that a franchisee was in negotiations with a well-known franchisor to transfer the franchisee’s trade secret (which was already deposited in the registry) to the well-known franchisor. Suppose further that negotiations break down, but the franchisee learns later on that the well-known franchisor had been using the franchisee’s trade secret in the interim.  Assuming that the well-known franchisor did not register similar information prior to negotiations, a strong evidentiary presumption exists that the franchisee disclosed his secret to the well-known franchisor during negotiations and that the franchisor used it illegally. Alternatively, assuming that the negotiations went well, recording the transfer of the trade secret from the franchisee to the well-known franchisor is easy: the franchisee’s title on the registry would display “former owner” while the well-known franchisor’s title on the registry would display “current owner.”Maintaining these titles displayed in the registry for a reasonable time (perhaps five years) after the transfer occurs is likely to deter “former owners” from succeeding in reselling the secret. The same deterrent effect can apply to situations where former franchisees (of a well-known franchisor) attempt to sell the franchisor’s trade secret to one of the franchisor’s competitors without disclosing the source of the secret, or when a licensee who possesses an exclusive license to use a trade secret (obtained from the owner) attempts to either register himself as owner of the trade secret on the registry or to attempts sell the Id. at 505.   A similar hypothetical is presented in Vinizky, supra note 217, at 510. Id. The well-known franchisor can refute this presumption by presenting evidence that the information was in its possession before the negotiations took place. Id.

Of course, this scenario can well have the parties in reverse, with a franchisor’s trade secret and a franchisee’s access to, and possible theft or misappropriation of, that secret.   Id. at 512. According to the procedures of the proposed trade secret registry, a former owner of a trade secret who attempts to resell a trade secret would have to register again as owner of the trade secret. Id. at 512. In this scenario, the trade secret registrar would perform a conflict check (as it would do for any initial registration of a secret) between the status of the secret and the potential registrant/seller (who’s in actuality the “former owner” of the secret in this scenario). Vinizky, supra note 217, at 512. If the trade secret registrar discovers that the secret information is similar to the one that the potential seller had transferred previously, he would be allowed to prevent the transaction from happening. Id. Further, the registrar should have the discretion to disclose the attempted fraudulent sale to the current owner of the secret; this is akin to the Model Rule allowing a lawyer to permissively disclose confidential information relating to the representation of a client “to prevent, mitigate or rectify substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result” (emphasis added).

The TRIPS Agreement also sets minimum standards for enforcing intellectual property rights.    A similar approach to trade secrets is taken abroad. International treaties concerning intellectual property require countries to protect undisclosed information, otherwise known as trade secrets. One major treaty requires countries to offer protection to information that is (1) a secret, (2) has commercial value because it is a secret, and (3) is protected by reasonable steps under the circumstances. The language parallels the requirements for domestic protection, which is comparable to the United States’ participation in TRIPS. TRIPS facilitates the ability of international franchisors to obtain protection wherever it is authorized. TRIPS article 41, in combination with TRIPS article 46, give individuals the right to take legal action to protect their trade secrets through pre-emptive actions. 248 This can be done through legal actions such as non-disclosure agreements or through litigation. International enforceability of non-disclosures is vital to protecting the contents of an operations manual. The non-disclosure agreement should explicitly state that the franchisee or potential franchise must remain silent regarding any facts he comes across while negotiating the franchise agreement, regardless of where the information comes from, such as from an operating agreement.Despite the existence of TRIPS, a country may go above those requirements and provide a franchisor or franchisee additional protection with respect to trade secrets.

Martina Parusova Zimova, Czech RepublicNTERNATIONAL RANCHISING CZR-1, CZR-4 (Dennis Campbell ed., 2nd ed. 2019legislation and franchise specific legislation designed to address the intricacies of franchise law. Franchise specific legislation has also been internationally implemented in regard to operations manuals, such as in the United Kingdom. As franchisors adapt to the new EU laws, proactive trade secret protection is important to prevent exploitation and disclosure of previously private processes that may have been subject to different regulations. For example, in Denmark, franchisors were previously treated as suppliers and franchisees as independent distributors, so enactment of the TSD may result in new trade secret concerns for franchisors.Likewise, in Sweden, the operations manual, which covers prohibitions of making copies of the manual and secrecy aspects, is seen as a loan of franchisor information that terminates when the franchise agreement terminates. In Sweden, operations manuals are considered to have originality needed to get copyright protection. In Italy, the information in operating manuals are protected by copyright law, and the know-how that is contained in the manual must be safely kept by the franchisee, cannot be copied by franchisees for third parties and the franchisee must return it at the end of the term for the franchise agreement. In Malaysia, the Franchise Act requires the franchisee to provide a written guarantee that the franchisee and the franchisee’s directors, spouses, immediate family members of directors, and employees will not disclose the information in the operations manual to anyone. Other countries that allow operations manuals to receive copyright protection are Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Cypress, Denmark, Italy,  and Singapore. Some countries do not have regulations regarding operating manuals, like in the Czech Republic, which says that the operating manual itself should regulate its use. Therefore, it is possible to  Franchises are unique because disclosure to many parties is necessary. Consider a manufacturer with manufacturing trade secret.

It never has to leave the factory, which helps with protecting the secret. In the franchise context, the franchisor must expose these secrets to all franchisees and the franchisees expose those secrets to its employees.

Franchisors would be best suited by developing creative, original content in their operating manuals, ensuring that they would be protectable under copyright law as well as trade secret law. While there are varying approaches worldwide, a well-planned out operating manual and franchise agreement can serve as the basis for franchisor copyright and trade secret protections. A well-constructed manual will help protect the franchisor’s brand reputation and credibility, and further serve as the basis for the obligations that the franchisee must follow. It is when a franchisor-franchisee relationship terminates or a trade secret is no longer in use that issues arise about better franchise network service.  Economic Efficiency and Commercial Value Considerations Another area to consider is what happens to trade secrets no longer in use. In other words, if a franchisor utilized a process but then eventually replaced it, does the former process still receive protection? To be under continued protection, the trade secret must remain commercially valuable. One proposed standard is that commercial value – the worth of a business –  must stem from the secret’s ability to be used in making a trade commodity, an idea that dates back to ancient civilizations trading in items like spices and seashells. The power of those civilizations was seen as proportionate to the civilization’s ability to manage a commodity exchange and hold onto secrets.Another standard states that a trade secret’s value is determined by whether the secret gives the holder a competitive edge over its competition. Therefore, if the information becomes obsolete, it provides no value and cannot be a trade secret. This analysis should be done for specific franchisors and not a secondary market. For example, a trade secret does not retain its commercial value because it could be valuable in a secondary market – its value should be measured in the context of its value to the entity who is seeking enforcement of trade secret law with respect to the entity’s proprietary practices, procedures, or products.Policy dictates that information no longer in use should not be subject to trade secret protection. See Chris Simboli, Intellectual Property Law Considerations for Business Lawyers, 61 TDVOC. 38, 39 (2018) (noting that trade secret protection can last in perpetuity as long as it remains secret or confidential).   Taylor v. Babbitt, 760 F. Supp. 2d 80, 88 (D.D.C. 2011) (citing the plaintiff’s assertion).   Nick K. Lioudis, Commodities Trading: An OverviewNVESTOPEDIA (May 21, 2019), https://www.investopedia.com/investing/commodities-trading-overview/.  Id.  Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co, 467 U.S. 986, 1011 n.15 (1984) (“We emphasize that the value of a trade secret lies in the competitive advantage it gives its owner over competitors.”). Taylor, 760 F. Supp. 2d at 88.  Id. See id. at 89 (“[The materials] are not commercially valuable because their economic value does not derive from the competitive advantage they confer upon Fairchild within the antique aircraft market.”). Economic principles, on the other hand, hold that unused resources should be distributed in order to maximize efficiency. Economic efficiency is when every resource is used in the best way possible to serve the needs of individuals and entities while waste and inefficiency are minimized. In other words, nothing can be changed in a way that makes one part better without making another part worse off. Therefore, even though a business may no longer use it, another individual may be able to use that obsolete system or adapt it for his or her own purposes. This creates a maximum efficiency, which benefits the economy in the long run. On the other side of that argument is business owner consideration. The framers of the constitution undoubtedly considered intellectual property in drafting the document, as evidenced by the express protections granted to science and innovations. Without such protections, franchises would be harmed because free riders could gain all of the benefits from the intellectual property without doing any of the work. If people were able to just wait until someone else invented an idea, there would be little incentive research and development. Discovery of a new and innovative idea normally takes a substantial amount of resources, dedication, and time, which usually requires some sort of incentive or payout. A franchisor may dedicate significant revenue toward reformulating advertising strategies, secret sauces, or production lines. If a franchisor creates a new recipe, the old recipe may not necessarily lose its value even though the old recipe simply sits in the back of the franchisor’s intellectual property drawer. Take for example the McDonald’s McRib recipe. The McRib is not always on the menu, and should not lose its value just while it is sitting in the franchisor’s intellectual property drawer; when the McRib is placed on the menu, for limited times, it is a popular item for the franchisor. A way to try to protect trade secrets is to have a confidentiality agreement with franchisees in tandem with a trade secret protection policy.Therefore, another balancing act is required between the need to allocate resources for efficiency versus the need to incentivize business owners to develop and protect their processes. An ex-franchisee may still remember a sauce and be able to use it for a different purpose. This allows the creation of a new business and the competition necessary for our capitalist economy is satiated. However, this may result in franchisors being hesitant in updating their trade secrets due to fear of losing them in the public domain. If the franchisor  Jim Chappelow, Economic EfficiencyNVESTOPEDIA, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economic_efficiency.asp (last updated Feb. 28, 2020).Id.

For a discussion on the framers’ intent, see Dotan Oliar, Making Sense of the Intellectual Property Clause: Promotion of Progress as a Limitation on Congress's Intellectual Property Power, 94 GL.J. 1771 (2006).

Thus, to solve the problem with non-used trade secrets, a focus should be placed on the business’ use of the trade secret.  A trade secret may be classified as information known to only a small number of people in an industry, with the benefit coming from the small number of businesses that can use the information to their advantage. If a franchise’s secret becomes unused, the franchisees are among the few individuals privy to such information. The trade secret still may retain most of its value. In proving commercial value, an exact science should not be required. A business should not necessarily have to give a specific date on which the value will arise. Let us return to the McDonald’s McRib previously mentioned. It may not be used by the franchisee all the time because the item is only offered as a special during “McRib season” but the McRib’s recipe is considered a trade secret of McDonald’s. The franchisors and franchisees are among the few individuals privity to the recipe and provides value to those involved.  Lastly, establishing a lease-like relationship may benefit both parties. In such a situation, if a franchisee operated the franchise effectively for a specified term in the lease, the franchisee would be able to keep some of the trade secrets after the franchise relationship is terminated. This would create a less daunting investment to franchisees because they would be able to continue using parts of their investment instead of franchise-specific things going to waste. This mechanism would give franchisors a stronger advertising incentive as well as a more amicable relationship with the franchisee. Another benefit this mechanism would have for franchisors is the ability to pick which trade secrets to allow a franchisee to continue to use and which to keep for future use. Also, a franchisee would not have to worry about future claims from franchisors for trade secret infringement. If the franchisor kept some of the trade secrets after the relationship ended, then the trade secret would belong to the franchisee at that point and not the franchisor. A reason this is a benefit for franchisees is also why it is a hardship for franchisors. If franchisors give parts of their trade secrets to franchisees, the  Robert Unikel, Bridging the “Trade Secret” Gap: Protecting “Confidential Information” Not Rising to the Level of Trade Secrets, 29 LL.J. 841, 851 (1998). While this type of information may not necessarily be a trade secret (because unrelated groups may discover the information independently), the same logic can still be used to define the value of a trade secret.  In a lawsuit for misappropriation of a trade secret, one may ask what should be required: A mere showing that the trade secret had value to the owner or that provides a competitive advantage to other businesses if allowed into the public domain?  In other words, a sauce recipe, for instance, has value because of the time that it took to develop it; even if the new recipe is objectively better, misappropriating even the older recipe might lessen the gap between industry leader X and competitor Y, who has directly acquired X’s old recipe or at least seen it fall into the public domain.

Trade secrets provide an array of benefits and concerns for a franchisor. Trade secret law covers intangible property that deserves protection but falls outside copyright, patent, or other forms of intellectual property. However, to retain a commercial benefit from the information requires franchisors to remain ever vigilant, which can be extremely costly.   The Applicability of U.S. Antitrust Law      In Civility v. Molly Manners, it was alleged that Molly Manners stole the information from Civility’s operations manual and used the information to establish its own set of videos to teach children about manners and mannerisms. There was no conduct that would fall under the purview of the Sherman Act, the federal statute that bans restraint on trade and monopolization, because there were no actions that unreasonably restrained trade, no mergers, or combining of directorates. It would likewise not fall under the Clayton Act because there was no contract or agreement that would unreasonably restrain trade and there was no intent or conspiracy to monopolize. Civility’s only choice for recourse was under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which specifically proscribes any type of deceptive or unfair behavior which affects commerce, there was a possibility for Civility to obtain a remedy. Unfortunately, Civility could not bring the claim itself but would have to wait for the FTC to take action.The court determined that had Civility developed a more extensive set of evidence, it may have demonstrated that Molly Manners intentionally undermined the previous settlement agreement for its own benefit and intentionally used the videos and processes to develop its own lessons. If that were the case, Civility would likely have been able to demonstrate that Molly Manners, through unfair or deceptive practices, obtained this information and used it to undermine Civility’s economic position in the marketplace.

Nothing in the case indicated that Civility would be entitled to receive the portion of income that its materials created. Perhaps the best outcome for Civility would have resulted if Civility had required Molly Manners to sign an NDA specifying each trade secret at issue because Civility could have brought a misappropriation claim. So long as the agreement stated the trade secrets with adequate particularity, Civility’s lawsuit likely would have had a different result. A Brief Overview of the Sherman, Clayton, and Federal Trade Commission Acts Antitrust laws have had the same basic objective since the inception of the Sherman Act in 1890: “To protect the process of competition for the benefit of the consumer, making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently, keep prices down, and keep quality up.” Antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman and Clayton Acts, were implemented to prevent unreasonable restraints of trade. Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits any type of contract, agreement, conspiracy, or combination thereof from restricting trade. Any type of behavior in restraint of trade, such as price fixing, cartel-like structures, or collusion between competitors –  including certainly all types of competition law behaviors associated with franchising and the professional or educational endeavors of the franchise bar and academia – is subject to both criminal and civil liability under the Sherman Act.In addition to these types of examples of trade restraints, the legislature and regulatory bodies have The Antitrust LawsRADE , https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws (last visited Jan. 10, 2021).

Jonathan Solish, Franchising 101: Key Issues in the Law of Franchisinghttps://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/publications/blt/2010/03/01_solish The American Bar Association’s (“ABA’s”) Committee on Franchising was first housed within the ABA’s Antitrust Law Section.  Only later did the ABA’s Forum on Franchising form, ultimately as a group within the ABA distinct from any other particular group or section. H. Stephen Ward, Editor’s Column, Newsletter of the Forum Committee on Franchising, 1 A 2, 2 (1980).   Indeed, franchise law is a modern development and most law schools do not have educational resources discussing this issue. It was finally recognized as a distinct area of law in 2009 and it is extremely popular as a method of developing a business. Thus it should be treated as a separate entity and have its own legislation instead of heavily relying on other areas of law. See Rupert M. Barkoff, Franchise Law as an Academic DisciplineRANCHISINGASESATERIALS ROBLEMSsupra note 32,at xxv, xxvi-xxxi (citing, inter alia, State ex. rel. Couns. for Discipline v. Orr, 759 N.W.2d 702 (Neb. 2009)).    This begs the question: In the franchising context, do antitrust laws miss the mark? Antitrust laws were written when “new technology meant ‘typewriters, buggy whips and bicycles.’” Fiona M. Scott Morton, Is Antitrust Enforcement Out of Date?,ALE NSIGHTS (July 10, 2018), https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/is-antitrust-enforcement-out-of-date. codified certain behaviors that are so egregious and clearly unreasonable that they are illegal per se In other words, the conduct is illegal and there is no need to consider whether the behavior actually affected trade. However, in contrast with per se conduct, any other type of behavior that arguably restricts trade is subject to a “rule of reason” analysis. This doctrine is fundamental to antitrust analysis.  The Sherman Act only restricts behavior that unreasonably restricts trade. A court must analyze and weigh both the pro-competitive benefits of the challenged conduct against the anticompetitive effect of that conduct, and prohibit conduct which, on balance, is anticompetitive. In 2019, the EU opened an investigation into Amazon for its dual role in being a marketplace and retailer to use data from the company’s merchants against the merchants. The same week Amazon reached a settlement with Germany with the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. In addition to proscribing contracts, agreements, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, the Sherman Act also forbids monopolies, attempts to monopolize, and conspiracies to monopolize.A second piece of antitrust legislation, the Clayton Act, “prevents and eliminates contracts, corporate mergers and acquisitions, and interlocking directorates.” Congress gave broad discretion to the agencies to enforce antitrust laws. With the implementation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), Congress sought to curtail and prevent “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or deceptive acts.” The FTCA established the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the regulatory body empowered to enforce the antitrust laws and to punish those businesses and individuals who would undermine – through unfair practices – commerce.The FTCA was implemented in the same spirit as the Sherman Act—that is, it was enacted for a policy  Cont’l T.V., Inc. v.

In addition to the legislature’s goals and policies of policing anti-competitive behavior, the legislative doctrines that protect consumers were implemented for that very reason – to prevent practices “unfair” to consumers.Antitrust and Franchise Operations Manuals: Regulating and Remedying Violations As was the case for regulation of operations manuals, antitrust laws often require a balancing act. On one side is the consumer benefit analysis and the desire to avoid anti-competitive behavior. On the other end, various agencies have to be careful to not slow “legitimate, pro-competitive behavior.” While the behaviors may not look the same, it is the risk of being classified as anti-competitive that deters businesses from making aggressive decisions that could benefit consumers in the long run.An individual or business wronged by anti-competitive behavior is entitled to request injunctive relief.If a party seeks damages, the situation becomes more complicated. The applicable statute allows for any “reasonable system of estimating aggregate damages as the court . . . may permit.” This system creates a massive financial risk for any defendant and the situation is aggravated by the remedy of treble damages. In the franchising context, this could have a substantial impact. If a franchisor is found liable for an antitrust violation, treble monetary damages can put the franchisor in a dire situation. Recall that a franchisor is required to provide services to other franchisees, such as advertising, management training, and design. It has to keep investing in itself in order to remain an appealing franchise. When a franchisor has a civil liability award or judgment hanging over its head, the franchisor may not have enough capital to perform those functions. In such a scenario, the franchisor may be exposed to additional franchisee suits for not performing contractual duties. One poor calculation or judgment could effectively end the franchise entirely.

Furthermore, the FTC Franchise Rule requires the disclosure of pending litigation to the franchisee. Knowledge of this litigation can serve as a deterrent and prevent potential franchisees from signing franchise agreements. See 16 C.F.R. §§ 436.5(c)(1)(i)(A), (i)(B) (2018).  In contrast, perhaps the laws are too weak to deter franchisors’ anticompetitive behavior. The FTC Franchise Rule mainly requires a disclosure and does not necessarily regulate the behavior that occurs after the franchise agreement has been signed. This occurs when a franchisor terminates a franchise on a whim or when a franchisor authorizes a second franchise despite its negative effects on pre-existing franchises. As of now, franchisees must rely on common law and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It is extremely difficult to wage a war over “good faith,” and the damages are limited to compensatory or restitution damages. This creates little incentive for a franchisee to take on the risk and cost of litigation, especially given the low probability of success for most such claims. Indeed, the franchise contract, drafted by the franchisor, usually bolsters the franchisor’s defenses significantly.The sword of antitrust cuts both ways. Franchisors must concern themselves with vertical and horizontal restraints, price discrimination, and unfair trade practices. Unfair trade practice claims are usually grounded in state law and based on the Unfair Trade Practices Act (“UTPA”). Wronged individuals can make a claim by alleging that an act was unfair or deceptive. In Florida, part of enforcement depends on a plaintiff bringing suit, but if only a relatively small amount is involved in the potential recovery for the case, there might not be enough to even recover the franchisee’s legal fees. As such, potential plaintiffs might determine that the potential lawsuit is too costly and too much of a hassle. This causes individual  Cavanagh, supra note 321,at 631 (citing deterrence as a goal of treble damages). But see 16 C.F.R. § 436.9 (2018)(regulating conduct that may contradict initial disclosures after the agreement was signed).   Cavanagh, supra note 321. Unfortunately for the franchisee, most of the litigation over good faith and fair dealing ends in the franchisor’s favor. So, there is little unpredictability regarding outcome, but the actual path getting there varies from court to court. A study of 100 franchise contracts found that each of these provisions were found in over half of the contracts: advising the franchisee to obtain legal counsel about the contract (51%), and declaring that the franchisee had in fact obtained counsel, accounting assistance, and other professional support (58%); the franchisee’s admission that it had the opportunity to obtain clarification about any aspects of the proposed franchise (55%) and that it had conducted its own independent investigation of the merits of this particular franchise investment, for which no franchisor guarantees of profitability had been made (93%); the parties’ express recognition that there is no fiduciary relationship between the franchisor and its franchisees (83%). Emerson, supra note 53, at 694-695. Furthermore, the author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that over half of them – 270 – had clauses specifically stating that the franchisee waived any claims for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the express (quite pro-franchisor) terms of the franchise agreement negated any possible contrary terms under an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or that no covenant will imply any rights or duties inconsistent with a fair construction of the agreement’s provisions.

The UTPA’s purpose is to make consumers whole, and this goal is not served if attorney’s fees are not included.To determine that an act was unfair, courts use the FTC Cigarette Rule. The rule examines the following: (1) whether the practice \"offends public policy\" - as set forth in \"statutes, the common law, or otherwise\"; (2) \"whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; and (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).\" One example of an unfair practice is the theft of trade secrets. If a party alleges the theft of trade secrets, it becomes a misappropriation claim and follows the above analysis.Enter Civility Experts, this Article’s illustrative example for matters of intellectual property and antitrust. Civility’s only recourse was under the FTCA, which specifically proscribes any type of deceptive or unfair behavior that affects commerce. Unfortunately, Civility could not bring the claim itself but would have to wait for the FTC to take action.  C. Civility’s Remedies under the FTCA On the other hand, to protect franchisees, the FTC has established a Franchise Rule that is enforced under the FTCA. The rule requires franchisors to provide prospective franchisees documents containing specific information about the franchise, its officers, and other franchisees. In essence, it is a disclosure provision that protects potential franchisees from any adverse economic harm by alleviating information asymmetry issues in the franchise-transaction setting. If there is an alleged rule violation, the Commission can review the situation and prove or disprove knowledge of deceit by showing whether the defendant had actual knowledge of the material misrepresentations, was recklessly indifferent to the reality of such  Unfair Trade Practices Act, supra note 328 (stating the rule was adopted by the Connecticut Supreme Court).

The case is unclear due to the underdeveloped evidentiary record. Even if Civility could show that Molly Manners engaged in deceptive or fraudulent conduct, the FTCA remedy would still be difficult for Civility to obtain.It is more likely that Molly Manners would have to contend against the FTC in litigation, and as a result pay damages, but it is unlikely that Civility would find any type of monetary or injunctive remedy under these antitrust laws. Additionally, the FTC may seek “consumer redress” from Molly Manners, but it must provide that a reasonable person would have known that the conduct was dishonest or fraudulent.Conclusion In franchising, the best route for recourse against potential defendants who disclose confidential information—whether intentionally, negligently, or recklessly—is through trade secret law. The foundational policies behind trade secret law are clear – the protection of secret information for businesses that derive a material economic benefit from such information. Furthermore, the United States is party to international treaties that allow for the worldwide protection of trade secrets, like TRIPS. The framework for U.S. trade secret law mirrors these international commitments. However, trade secret law is not a perfect course of action because of vulnerabilities coming from independent creation. In contrast to trade secret law, the policies behind antitrust law are based on the idea that two or more businesses engaging in anti-competitive conduct, irrespective of efficiencies, could lead to detrimental effects for the national economy. Therefore, antitrust laws may be more effective in order for franchisees or franchisors to combat anti-competitive behavior between two others. For example, if Franchisor R and Franchisee E engage in anti-competitive conduct that jeopardizes Franchisee B’s business, B should be able to rely on antitrust laws for protection.  Circumstances should dictate whether a particular behavior violates trade secret law, antitrust law, both,  Fed. Trade Comm’n. v. Int’l Diamond Corp, No. C-82-0878, 1983 WL 1911, at *1 (N.D. Cal.

A franchisee that takes reasonable steps to protect the franchisor’s trade secrets and lacks the intent to violate trade secret laws should not be held liable if somehow, despite the franchisee’s following instructions, a trade secret accidentally gets out. On the other hand, if a franchisee fails to rise to this standard of honesty, fairness, and reasonableness, the franchisee should be held liable for a foreseeable consequence – the revelation of trade secrets.  Franchise relationships often are rather settled, and the traditional approach is to defer to the language of an agreement. Courts often defer to the operations manual or franchise agreement to settle most disputes. However, these agreements are not ironclad and foolproof. Courts must recognize, indeed play a part in, a changing legal landscape, with developments in particularly pertinent areas, such as trade secret law and antitrust law.  The operations manual has, or should have, some limitations in scope. Written contract terms and even lengthy, mutable operations manuals cannot cover every fact or issue. Case law and statutes can provide a path for resolution of disputes, giving franchisees the freedom to operate as they rightfully expected they could while providing franchisors the legal club to protect the franchise network’s business, including key property such as trade secrets. New federal trade secret laws, such as the DTSA, should help courts provide a uniform approach. In turn, there could be improved franchise planning and operations, with greater network efficiency and fairness. THE FAITHLESS FRANCHISOR: RETHINKING GOOD FAITH IN FRANCHISING Robert W. Emerson*  Abstract The rapid expansion of franchising requires that the courts, and the law in general, adapt to new circumstances, including the franchise parties’ rightful expectations. Franchisees and franchisors may not act in the spirit of the contract, and the traditional approach under contract damages law often fails to remedy that situation. For example, how can a franchisee or franchisor recover in the event of actions that are not prohibited by the contract, but that nevertheless run counter to a party’s natural (and probable) expectations? These and other issues are addressed in the context of a “Fairness in Franchising” rule. Currently, remedies for disgruntled parties to franchise agreements are limited to those available for the breach of an express contract provision, and they certainly do not allow for an award of punitive damages. However, legal remedies for bad faith in franchising agreements already exist. For example, at common law, tort damages may be awarded in a cause of action for “bad faith.” The allowance of a tort cause of action for bad faith could deter bad acts by parties inducing franchise purchases, by would-be fraudsters (whether franchisors or franchisees) throughout the course of a franchise relationship, and otherwise by free-riding franchisees or through the opportunistic behaviors on the part of franchisors after an agreement has been executed. A standard test for franchising good faith and fair dealing will leave courts better able to not simply deal with bad acts, but also to encourage the franchise parties’ appropriate and mutually beneficial actions while they are reaching and then implementing their contracts.

We see this when courts decide for or against claims that the franchisor should be held liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In Canada, too, one sees the same approach, and the search  Immanuel Kant’s philosophies also contained an interpretation of the Golden Rule.

Brad Hanna & Mitch Koczerginski, Canada, in IRANCHISING CAN/5 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018) (citing Ontario Act, section 3(1)). Similar provisions are included in Canada’s other provinces as well. See New Brunswick Act, section 3(1); PEI Act, section 3(1); Manitoba Act, section 3(2); and OC Act, section 3(1). Curiously, however, New Brunswick is the only Canadian for and possible application of a good faith covenant can be found worldwide. The covenant is frequently limited—in effect, avoided—  because courts cannot simply insert a “good faith” provision into a contract.Nonetheless, while the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing “cannot replace the express provisions of a franchise agreement, [it certainly] may shed light on the parties’ intentions when there is no express provision.” In effect, the covenant “may serve as the best method to measure contract performance in franchising.”Some courts have declined to infer a good faith and fair dealing requirement into franchise agreements. For example, in the recent decision of Pizza Inn, Inc. v. Clairday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed the idea of strict compliance to the terms within a franchise-related option contract. The Court stated that, under Texas law, a franchise developer cannot invoke  equitable intervention as a means to province not to impose a duty of fair dealing. Richard R. Wozenilek, Canada, in NTERNATIONAL GENCY AND ISTRIBUTION CDN/47 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018). Although there is no uniform franchise legislation in Canada, the statutes in each of the provinces are substantially similar. Hanna & Koczerginski, supra, at CAN/2.  Good faith is applied to franchise contracts and the franchise relationship arising therefrom, in the two main legal traditions, the common law and the Civil Law.  [I]n civil law jurisdictions, the duty to act in good faith appears to imply a positive obligation to take affirmative steps to, inter alia, support franchisees throughout the franchise relationship and be responsive to threats faced by the franchise brand against competition. On the other hand, the common law duty of honest performance, which originates from a general organizing principle of good faith, seems to call for a negative obligation for franchisees to refrain from acting in a capricious manner towards franchisees, Perhaps more importantly, while the distinction between the application of the principle of good faith in these diverging legal traditions may not always be described as simply, it is generally accepted that the notion of good faith in civil law would impose more significant expectations and obligations on a franchisor, and likely sooner, than would similar concepts under common law.

Id. at 1066-1067. evade the plain terms of the agreement when the franchise developer attempted to exercise a renewal option.The franchisee had a twenty-year agreement with the franchisor for a Pizza Inn franchise. At the end of the twenty years, the franchisee had the option to renew for two five-year terms if the franchisee notified the franchisor of the franchisee’s intent to renew at least six months before the current term expired. When the first renewal term expired, the franchisor refused to grant the franchisee a second renewal because the franchisee had been two months late in notifying the franchisor of his intent to renew. Generally, in Texas, courts require strict compliance with option contracts.The franchisee tried to argue for equitable intervention to allow the franchisee to exercise the option to renew. Equitable intervention is an exception to strict compliance, which is allowed when 1) the delay is slight, 2) the optioner’s loss is small, and 3) failure to “grant relief would result in such hardship . . . as to make it unconscionable to enforce literally the condition precedent.” Equitable intervention has only been applied to lease agreements in the past. The franchisee had argued that not allowing him to renew his option contract would be a hardship because 1) the franchisee would partially forfeit the $1,250,000 initial investment to become an area developer, 2) there would be a forfeit of future profits, and 3) the franchise location would close. The court found that the reasons given by the franchisee did not meet the hardship prong because they did not lead to a forfeiture. The court reasoned that when the option expired the franchisee had received everything he had bargained for, that future profits were not an unconscionable hardship except for extreme cases, and that the franchise store closure was not an unconscionable hardship.The decision in Pizza Inn, Inc. v. Clairday overlooks the nature of the franchise relationship  and focuses exclusively on unconscionability as a reason to not apply strict compliance. However, why must equity be bound by (limited to) unconscionability? One could argue that, in applying the doctrine of unconscionability to the facts, a court should still account for the magnitude of harm and whether the parties acted in good faith.

The court also falls to recognize, for example, the potential answers to derive from concepts, provisions, or principles in the Uniform Commercial Code or the Second Restatement of Contracts.   renewal option in this case was not a naked option but was inextricably linked to the underlying franchise development agreement. Additionally, it is clear that the two agreements in Pizza Inn, Inc. v. Clairday (the development agreement and the renewal agreement/provision) should have been read together. Then, the court could have easily concluded that the developer suffered a forfeiture: The developer paid his initial $1,250,000 fee, which could be seen as including the discounted future value of the renewal options. If the optionee had paid this amount over time, not upfront as a fixed fee, would paying a much smaller amount – e.g.,  $200,000 one year before the expiration - have sufficed? Apparently, though, this was not an issue for the court, with its narrow view of matters involving franchising; the court’s turning toward good faith could have been a move towards justice. We will now consider tht further, as we examine the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.     The covenant itself is the expectation that the parties will adhere to “community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness” and refrain from interfering with the contractual rights of the other party or parties.Put another way, the covenant “prohibits actions that destroy, injure, or limit a party’s right or ability” to receive the expected benefits of the contract. As business deals unfold, uncertainty and complexity may reign, leaving any application of a broad-minded “Golden Rule” for franchise parties - extremely difficult as doing so requires the determination of community standards for a specific set of facts. Business lawsuits, for example, raise questions as to what “decency” is and at what point the parties are interfering with each other’s contractual rights. Thus, the term “good faith” has no precise meaning because it is subject to court interpretation on a case-by-case basis.Still, while the subject, good faith, may seem ephemeral, there are a number of principles and improvements that can be pursued. The Article first considers the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and how a party harmed by the covenant’s breach may need more than simply contract damages, which are insufficient to cover all the harms incurred. The following section, Part II of the Article, reviews special consumer or business relationships and the covenant, while Part III looks to franchising and the available damages for a breach of the covenant, usually just contract-related awards.

The Article then proceeds to major concerns such as fighting franchisee free-riding while also working to facilitate franchisee protections. It concludes with information about comparable franchisee protections abroad that may serve to model improvements in the U.S. law on good faith in franchising. Standards for good faith and fair dealing, with both prohibitions and perhaps safe harbors, may enable courts to foster appropriate conduct and to deter franchisor opportunism. NSUFFICIENCY OF ONTRACT AMAGES    In the event of a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the non-breaching party should receive contract damages. The purpose of damages is to assist the non-breaching party in recovering any financial losses or injuries that the party suffered because of the breach. The non-breaching party is normally entitled to (1) compensatory or liquidated damages, or (2) specific performance.    In the franchise context, an award of contract-related damages may be insufficient. In California, for instance, the amount of damages for a breach of the implied covenant in the employment context is limited to actual damages caused by the breach. Specific examples include the value of the loss of compensation and the benefits and financial damage that may result from a franchisee’s or a franchisor’s breach. More generally, it is the total loss in value, any incidental or consequential damages, and any cost or loss that the non-breaching party avoided by not having to perform.    Franchisees typically face severe challenges trying to prove damages that are “certain.” For example, in the event of a territorial encroachment how could a franchisee demonstrate that a loss of revenue stemmed specifically from the actions of its franchisor? Indeed, a franchise’s failure can result from cultural changes,  Restatement 2d of Contracts, § 205 (2nd 1981). OBERT MERSONUSINESS  166 (6th ed. 2015); Francis G.X.

To show lost revenue, franchisees ordinarily must provide business records or expert testimony establishing a “reasonably accurate” amount. However, when a franchisee has yet to operate for a sufficient length of time, providing enough evidence to create a reasonable estimate of revenue losses may not be possible. Additionally, franchisees often can assert a quantifiable experience value to their franchise.          One issue, in particular, is the valuation of any goodwill the franchisee may have generated. Goodwill is the loyalty and reputation that a business has developed and which goes to the benefit of the franchise name and, more generally, the franchisor. There are no set ways to calculate goodwill, and the franchisor normally retains ownership of any goodwill through the franchise agreement itself. This poses an interesting question: If the franchisor breaches the franchise agreement, is the franchisee’s claim to any generated goodwill thereby strengthened?    The foreseeability requirement, insofar as it restricts the award of compensatory or consequential damages, may also present a high barrier for the injured franchisee to overcome. In this instance, the franchisee is required to show that the franchisor could have foreseen that the damages would occur because of the breach. Generally, predicting a breach of contract is difficult, even if one could foresee and thereby calculate the damages that would follow a said breach.       Lastly, the franchisee must mitigate any damages that arise after a breach occurred.

Id. obstacle because of franchise agreement terms. A franchisor may require that the franchisee return property or dispose of the property in a certain way. Additionally, there are certain investments that a franchisee makes for the purpose of a franchise agreement that the franchisee cannot use in any other context. Each of these hypothetical requirements may reduce the franchisee’s ability to recoup its investment.     Other forms of damages, such as liquidated damages or specific performance, are equally unlikely to be fruitful for an injured franchisee. This is because franchisees have notoriously inferior bargaining powerand will not likely be able to convince a franchisor to add a provision that provides for liquidated damages in the event the franchisor breached its obligations. Indeed, the franchisor may simply dictate the terms of the franchise agreement. This pro-franchisor power disparity emanates from law upholding franchisors’ contractual rights and from industry practice (a franchisor’s knowledge of the franchisee’s business) as well as the franchisee’s dependent state, along with economic and educational imbalances. Many franchisees do not even have legal counsel advising them about contract terms perhaps available to them, let alone negotiating on their behalf. Emerson, supra note 8, at 693 app. § C(9)(c) (review of 100 franchise contracts in 1993 and in 2013 showed that in 78% and 81%, respectively, terminated franchisees were required to return to the franchisor all trademarked supplies, signs, stationery, forms, and other materials; . at 694 app. § C(9)(d) (finding that 55% of surveyed franchise contracts provided that all franchisee concepts become the franchisor’s exclusive property, dramatically up from just 3% in 1993).  Contracting parties may specify in their agreement a specific amount due to the nonbreaching party if the other party breaches. These are known as stipulated damages or, more commonly, liquidated damages. Liquidated damagesLACKICTIONARY 473 (10th ed. 2014) (stating that liquidated damages constitute “[a]n amount contractually stipulated as a reasonable estimation of actual damages to be recovered by one party if the other party breaches”; further noting that a proper liquidated damages clause means that the fixed sum in the contract “is the measure of damages for a breach, whether it exceeds or falls short of the actual damages”).   The threshold to receive specific performance is high because courts tend to prefer monetary damages instead of forcing the defendant to perform a certain action. Some of the common reasons courts put forth for this preference are the high cost of monitoring a defendant and the desire to avoid involuntary servitude.

The current judicial approach - supportive of franchisor-dictated terms (even, for example, liquidated damages that only apply in favor of the franchisor) - only exacerbates the imbalance in bargaining power. On the other hand, since there are mechanisms for calculating a liquidated amount for a breach, franchisees should also be able to take advantage of a damages calculation method in order to determine their rightful award if the franchisor breaches the franchise agreement. With possible contract awards being insufficient for a harmed franchisee, the courts should provide a more expansive set of remedies.    A philosophical precept of robust, mutually reinforcing duties can be the basis for protecting franchisees and, in turn, strengthening the franchise relationship. Promoting system-wide uniformity nurtures sales.Franchisees are willing to pay for a franchisor’s market brand that brings to the franchisee customers who would otherwise not come to a non-brand business offering the same or similar fare. Franchisors charge for that brand, in terms of fees and royalties, while maintaining sufficient controls to maintain strong trademarks and to prevent franchisee free-riding.    PECIAL ONSUMER OR USINESS ELATIONSHIPS    The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is an implicit covenant that requires all involved parties to behave so that every party may fully benefit from the terms of an agreement. In more elaborate language, one American court ruled that “a person vested with contractual discretion must exercise that discretion reasonably and with proper motive, and may not do so arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner inconsistent with Supra note 50.  In a related area, there are proposals to calculate franchise royalties more efficiently and fairly. Robert W. Emerson & Charlie C. Carrington, Devising a Royalty Structure that Fairly Compensates a Franchisee for Its Contribution to Franchise Goodwill, 14 V(2020).

Any action contrary to this requirement is traditionally viewed as a breach of an implied contract.Courts have demonstrated a reluctance to expand the provided treatment and refuse to allow the implied covenant to supersede contractual provisions. Some take the stance that it cannot be used to insert contract terms that could have been obtained through negotiation. Despite its opposition, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be invaluable to protecting the franchisee from an arbitrary, callous, or even spiteful franchisor.    Enforcing laws to ensure good faith and fair dealings of franchisors is crucial to the health of a franchisee It is not prohibited for franchisors to deal in ways that best suit their business, but they are held to a certain standard to exhibit candor and engage in good faith when negotiating with a franchisee. Franchisors in the United States should understand that misrepresenting pertinent information in pre-contractual negotiations and even lack of certain details required by disclosures will serve serious consequences and will not be tolerated in franchise dealings. Honesty from a franchisor will not only build trust between itself and its franchisee but also likely facilitate the advancement of mutual interests.

J. 111, 111 (2000) (noting that courts are reluctant to allow the covenant to impact the franchise relationship). have employed multiple approaches to enforce implied covenants: typically, the franchisor is still obliged to perform in good faith despite a contract clause reserving sole discretion to the franchisor. Florida, for example, recognizes the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The covenant “is intended to protect the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties in light of their express agreement.” Good faith performance is important to uphold a franchisor’s legal obligation and encourage its future business, but a few states have allowed franchisors “sole discretion” to negate what was presumed to be a franchisor’s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Indeed, any use of discretion “should be consistent with the overall purpose of the agreement and not arbitrary, capricious or unduly surprising.”    Compensation in these disputes is normally limited to contract-related damages. However, there are some instances where contract damages for breach of implied covenants are insufficient. In these cases, franchisors  Mark Dady, Sole Discretion: So What?

This does run counter to the great latitude given for a franchisor’s “discretion” in overseeing the franchise system, as specified in the franchise agreements and disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs). The author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that the vast majority of them – 462 – had clauses specifically acknowledging the franchisor’s right to exercise broad discretion and that this alone would not breach an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

If the franchisor is able to exert unlimited discretion without any repercussions, the franchisee is at a disadvantage before the agreement even begins. This imbalance often occurs when franchisors execute the franchise agreement. For instance, if the franchise is nationally known and possesses a variety of franchisees, ranging from sophisticated to novice, the franchisor may fail to enforce the agreement equally among the franchisees.To counter the stark “sole discretion” franchisor defense, a franchisee would use the numerous cases, including those outside of franchise litigation, in which there is a narrow interpretation of this defense. Consider Miller v. HCP Trumpet Investments, LLCThe plaintiff, Christopher Miller, asserted that the defendant trustee board of a limited liability company (Trumpet), co-founded by Miller, violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Miller contended that the board had to conduct a Revlon-type or “open-market” sale process before selling the LLC under the covenant. Though the Miller court found Miller’s contention to be without merit, it held that “the mere vesting of ‘sole discretion’ did not relieve the Board of its obligation to use that discretion consistently with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”The franchise agreement does not lay out everything that is to occur during the franchise relationship. Franchisors and franchisees have expectations that may not be expressed in the written franchise agreement, expectations encompassed within an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Franchisees can have expectations about their relationship with their franchisors and expect certain things from their franchisors  Note, in the event of frivolous litigation, the attorney may be subject to punishment. MODEL ULES OF ONDUCT 1983). So while not a direct risk to the corporation, the attorney may have some objections against a frivolous action.  It is arguable that the franchisee is aware and accepts the disadvantage. After all, the franchise process involves discussions and plenty of disclosures.

(stating that inconsistent enforcement can lead to discrimination claims).  The Canadian approach to absolute discretion provides respite to the franchisee. The franchisor must act reasonably in exercising its discretion honestly and in good faith. Discretion must exercise discretion with a proper motive and not arbitrarily or capriciously. See Sally L.

Indeed, even the absence of a contractual prohibition on particular acts or omissions does not mean that one’s carrying out such acts or failing to act (omissions) necessarily falls short of evidence of bad faith. An act or omission may still be problematic – implicitly wrong while not expressly forbidden.  because of the special relationship that is the franchisee-franchisor relationship. When dealing with the implied covenant, the structural benefits that arise from the franchisee-franchisor relationship may warrant a more in-depth view of the expectations the franchisee has in the relationship. Benefits in the form of knowledge, experience, research, and reputation provide the base of the relationship, and monthly royalty payments make it last for the duration of the contract. Operational guidance in the form of research and training bolster the contractual relationship and place an onus on the franchisor to provide assistance to their franchisee. These structural benefits are enforced by contract but also comes with franchisee expectations for cooperation and support from the parent. It is not in either the franchisee’s or franchisor’s interests to slack on agreed contractual terms—especially given the special relationship that is formed which can give rise to a claim based on violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.EGAL EALISM    Similar to some employment and insurance contracts, what if it were possible for franchisees to recover tort damages? It would allow a party to escape statutory caps that may result in insufficient recovery.Franchisees should be able to recover if they are able to establish a special relationship or demonstrate that they have no other recourse in the marketplace. It would circumvent discretion-related defenses and allow the courts to uphold the purpose of the franchise agreement: a mutually beneficial and perhaps long-lasting relationship. This is an approach, referred to as the “legal realist” approach, that has developed in California.    Bolter v. Superior Court the California Court of Appeals held that an arbitration clause within a  The franchisee comes to expect and rely on the franchisor for comprehensive and ongoing training, marketing aids and advertisements, and other support services to further enhance the relationship.

For the franchisee, benefits arise out of a higher chance of success than in a sole proprietorship; shorter time to open; the selling power of a known brand; and the use of an established business model. See Eddy Goldberg, The Benefits of the Franchise ModelFranchising.com (last visited Dec. 30, 2020) (https://www.franchising.com/guides/benefits_of_the_franchise_model.html).   Notably, the success of a franchise system relies on a proven concept, the franchisor’s support and assistance, favorable market conditions, and a reputable brand developed by the franchisor. See Craig Tractenberg et al., The Franchisor’s Duty to Police the Franchise System, 36 FRANCHISE L.J. 87, 87 (2016).   This special relationship is symbiotic in nature. A franchisee that engages in free-riding subjects the franchise system to a possible loss of market share in the region and delivers inferior products or services to customers. The franchisor must ensure that the franchisee effectively represents the brand, as growth hinges on whether franchise stores faithfully represent the brand to the customer.

(noting this approach contrasts “legal libertarian” approach currently used by the Supreme Court). Legal realism is a populist idea of “contract interpretation principles that ‘give[s] judges explicit discretion over private transactions, freedom to do justice between the actual litigants before the court, and power to deter what the courts determine to be unfair market practices’ by inserting themselves into the contractual franchisor-franchisee relationship.” Id.  Bolter v. Superior Court,87 Cal. App. 4th 900 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001). franchise agreement was procedurally unconscionable because the franchisor had superior bargaining power, and the clause required the franchisee to arbitrate in Salt Lake City instead of California. The court used the legal realist doctrine of unconscionability to invalidate the franchise agreement’s arbitration clause as an unfair market practice. This case is a prime example of legal realist judicial techniques used to further populist goals, and correct economic and market power imbalances in franchising.Constructive discharge occurs when an employee discharges herself because of an employer’s treatment of the employee. In the United States, courts look towards the events that occurred around the time that the employee decided to discharge herself. In France, judges are not bound by the current classification of the employment relationship, such as employer-employee or franchisee-franchisor, when determining if there is an employment issue and how to classify the relationship, so a franchise arrangement can be reclassified as an employment contract to receive treatment under the constructive termination doctrine. In the United States, this idea is not prominent.Currently, there are no federal laws and only a few state laws that protect franchisees from retaliatory behavior from their franchisors. The idea of future legislation in this area is dim. The best hope that franchisees have for protection from retaliatory behavior from franchisors is from the legal community, courts, and regulators. In line with the information of a special relationship, in the independent contractor context, even if the relationship is not characterized as employee-employer, there still may be relief for an independent contractor in the case of retaliatory discharge. In Washington state, federal and state employment discrimination statutes apply to not only employees but also to non-employees such as those in an independent contractor-principal relationship. In Currier v. Northland Services, Inc., the Washington state Court of Appeals held that that status of the worker does not matter, and an independent contractor is also able to bring a claim for retaliatory discharge under the Washington Against  Scott & Snider, supra note 94, at 252.

Discrimination Act.Currier shows that employers cannot escape liability for employment discriminatory conduct because of the status of the employee as an independent contractor.Currier is not a franchising case, but it can apply to franchises. Sometimes franchisors terminate the franchise agreement in retaliation. Where normal employee-employer and employer-independent contractor relationships get the protection of anti-discrimination laws and retaliatory dismissal this can be applied to franchisor-franchisee relationships too. This can be especially helpful if a law or court decides that a franchisee is an independent contractor because the independent contractor relationship would not absolve the franchisor/employer of his contractual duties and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the termination context. Practically, where claims for retaliatory dismissal can be pointed to in a contractual employer-employee relationship, the presence of an independent contractor relationship does not absolve the employer (franchisor) of its contractual duties and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the termination context.  Occasionally, a court will observe that a franchisor-franchisee relationship has the attributes of a consumer relationship, with the franchisee (the consumer) subject to a contract of adhesion. The franchise agreements are fraught with bargaining inequality between the franchisor and franchisee, resulting in terms that reflect gross bargaining disparity. While it is a minority view that the franchisee is a consumer, several states enforce such claims under unfair trade practices statutes (Little FTC Acts) under which the franchisee has been found to be the consumer.Establishing a Special Relationship    To establish a special relationship or the no recourse requirements, it is important to distinguish franchisees from employees. Normally, franchisees are more aligned with independent contractor status. This is a vital distinction that usually eliminates the vicarious liability of the franchisor. Indeed, states frequently have created an exception to the implied covenant in the employment context. Franchisees face further trouble because, as independent contractors, they do not receive better treatment with respect to a good faith or fair See also Sambasivan v.

In fact, some jurisdictions bar tort recovery under the implied covenant and require plaintiffs to recover under retaliatory discharge.    The assertion of a claim for tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealings is rarely successful. One example of the many failures is Ennis v. H&R Block E. Tax Services There, the franchisee had worked with the franchisor for thirty years before the relationship ceased. The court noted that though, in effect, the fair dealing requirement is present in every contract, a tort claim is applicable only when a party violates its duty to act in good faith. The court further narrowed the tort claim by requiring a “special relationship” between the two parties. Despite the longstanding relationship and the fact that the “franchisor controls the sole means of [the franchisee’s] livelihood,” the court declined to grant tort damages to the franchisee. The court reasoned that to make such an award would unduly extend what constitutes a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.In denying to extend these “special relationships” to the context of a franchisor-franchisee relationship, the court opined “the most notable, but not exclusive, example [of such a special relationship] are contracts between insurers and insureds, where distinct elements are present, such as: unequal bargaining power, vulnerability, and trust among the parties; nonprofit motivations for contracting (e.g., peace of mind, security); and inadequacy of standard contract damages.” There are, of course, logical deficiencies in such reasoning: the court’s contrast of franchise relationships from the insurer-insured relationship reveals many similarities between the two. Like the insurer-insured relationship, the franchisor-franchisee relationship includes the “distinct elements” of unequal bargaining power, with the franchisor offering a “take it or leave it” franchise contract; vulnerability, as in Ennes where the franchisee depended on the franchisor for his livelihood; trust  Kropinak v. ARA Health Services, Inc., 33 P.3d 679, 682 (Ct. App. N.M. 2001). But see Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles, 416 P.3d 1, 11 (2018) (holding that a person is considered an employee unless “(A). . .the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact;  (B). . .the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business;  (C). . .the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.”) In effect, the potential that franchisees may not be considered independent remains strong, both on the facts in all states and on the law in the leading pro-“consumer” jurisdiction, California. Id. at 682. Certainly, constructive discharge, due to onerous franchisor requirements upon its franchisee or unmet obligations of the franchisor, may be an alternative remedy for mistreated franchisees. See Robert W. Emerson, Franchising Constructive Termination: Quirk, Quagmire or A French Solution?, 18 U.L. 163 (2015).  Ennes v. H&R Block E. Tax Servs., NO. 3:01CV-447-H, 2002 U.S. Dist.

While it may be frustrating to franchisees, the denial of tort related damages does serve a purpose. Awarding tort damages requires courts to balance two rightful interests - wronged franchisees deserving of compensation, and franchisors protecting their trademarks. By raising the prospects of a pro-franchisee damages award, a court awarding significant damages would encourage franchisors to act preemptively and minimize the impact of an unfavorable judgment. Potential actions—to protect themselves from both liabilities and pay for any awards—would include raising franchisee fees and restricting franchisee actions. In turn, franchisees would not be interested in paying higher fees and royalties to accommodate another franchisee’s recovery of extra damages.    Franchises are popular because, among other things, they facilitate individual ownership and operation of their own business. The imposition of further restrictions would make that dream harder to achieve. Still, the courts’ typical position, even when franchisee mistreatment is plain, is to focus on contractual limitations and not break precedent.Rare and Exceptional Cases of Special Relationships in a Tortious Breach     It was noted in Ennes that a tort damages award is appropriate only for “rare and exceptional cases” and gave only the example of the insurer-insured relationship, leaving open the possibility of including other ESTATEMENT ECOND OF ORTS 1979).

Ennes, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 419, at *12.   In an insurance contract there are two duties that are imposed involving good faith. Cheah You Sum, The Quagmire of Utmost Good Faith in Insurance LawUTURE OF ONTRACT  4.13 (Michael Furmston ed., 2020). The first duty is for “the proposer not to misrepresent any matter relating to the risk of the insured.” . The second duty is for “the proposer not to conceal facts which are material to the risk.” . These two duties are placed on the proposer because the proposer is in the best position to know of the potential risks and the insurer relies on the proposer for full disclosure. relationships by stating that the insurer-insured relationship was not the exclusive “special relationship” that would necessitate the availability of tort damages for breaches of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.The court further required more than the possibility that a franchisor could take unfair advantage of a franchisee. This stance falls in line with traditional jurisprudence. Courts are only interested in dealing with injuries-in-fact – ones that are concrete and particularized – and this begs the question of what is “rare and exceptional.” There is an argument to be made that a franchisor-franchisee relationship is a form of “insurance” in that a franchise pays, in the form of royalty fees and premiums, to run the business, receive guidance from the franchisor, and to use the franchisor’s trademarks. This argument can maybe establish a special relationship, or a special type of “insured” relationship, for a tort claim. This could make franchisees’ claims actionable because an independent tort claim based on breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing can be brought in court if there is a special relationship between the parties.One potential factor is franchisee inexperience. The franchise relationship in Ennes lasted for thirty years, and over time the franchisee likely became less dependent on his franchisor. An unsophisticated, comparatively new, and inexperienced franchisee presents a much stronger reason for courts to consider awarding tort damages. This is due to the reliance that inexperienced franchisees place upon the franchisor for business guidance: many franchise agreements require the franchisee to participate in ongoing training and routine compliance monitoring. This illustrates the trust inherent in a “special relationship”, which would necessitate awards in tort for breaches of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.     The concept of protecting unsophisticated parties, including franchisees, is longstanding. For example, unsophisticated franchisees often have more leeway to disregard, in effect, the impact of merger clauses.

The landlord decided to repave the parking lot six days before the tenant’s lease was to expire. This was a large cost that had not been included in the estimates for the year.The tenant objected to paying for the repaving because the tenant would not be using the parking lot after the lease expired. The Court ruled for the landlord because the contract stated that maintenance costs were allocated proportionally at the time the costs were incurred. This may seem extreme, especially when you consider that the tenant’s portion was around $89,000, but in this case, both parties were sophisticated and substantial business entities who were not without market power and knowledge.  While retention of an attorney may help the franchisee understand its situation and thereby presumably avoid the “unsophisticated” label, it is common for prospective franchisees not to employ or even try to have an initial consultation with attorneys. Some potential franchisees have turned to cheaper, online legal advice services such as Legal Zoom. A survey undertaken for this article demonstrates the concerns people have when looking to hire a franchise attorney, including factors other than money. Specifically, respondents, as prospective entrepreneurs, believed that the more experienced attorneys would already be representing the franchisor.

Emerson, supra note 54.    Id. unclear how many unrepresented franchisees speak to legal advisors on occasion, but the number clearly is much smaller than it should be. The Federal Trade Commission also recognizes the need to distinguish the different levels of franchisee’s experience. For example, the level of disclosures the franchisor must provide to the franchisee varies depending on the franchisee’s level of experience. As discussed above, there are plenty of factors and considerations courts make to protect the inexperienced. With support from a variety of regulations and case law, the sophistication of a franchisee should be a vital consideration when determining the existence of a special relationship. Also, differentiating legal experience from business experience should be used to analyze the sophistication of the franchisee.Outside of the franchise context, it is also difficult to find these special relationships. An example of these special relationships may be government actors protected by a public duty doctrine. This doctrine limits a government actor’s duty to respond to situations where a special relationship is present between an individual and the actor, not to the public at large. This standard is in place because the government has a general duty to protect its citizens. However, to avoid undue dependence on such protection, courts require a special relationship, stemming from “induce[d] detrimental reliance,” to trigger a duty of care. This approach is very fact-specific, with no bright-line rule. However, the presence of a special relationship, as a legal conclusion, tends to depend upon whether there has been dependence among the parties, unilaterally or bilaterally.An Unorthodox Explanation of Franchisee Dependence    A franchise can serve as a unique relationship between each franchisee. For example, a franchisee may seek special provisions or notify the franchisor of special conditions that sets it apart from other franchisees.

In the franchise agreement, the franchisor provides express assurances. The franchise agreement can discuss the term, area of protection, opening of the franchise, orientation and training, guidance, and more. Some assurances expressly or implicitly provided in the franchise agreement create a franchisee’s justifiable reliance on the franchisor. The agreement provides the royalty schedules, indemnification, contract interpretation, arbitration requirements, and more. These provisions seem to imply the existence of a “special relationship” subject to higher expectations of reliance on the franchise agreement. In fact, between half and two-thirds of all franchisees come from positions of dependent employment.    Consider a scenario where the franchisee sought specific assurances regarding territorial exclusivity. Due to the franchisee’s inexperience and unfamiliarity with common law doctrines such as parol evidence, the franchisee does not concern himself or herself with the fact that there are no provisions in the franchise agreement regarding exclusivity. Instead, the franchisee relies on the franchisor’s word. In this hypothetical, there is no fraudulent misrepresentation if the franchisor could have believed there would be no issue with encroachment. From another perspective, it may be almost impossible for the franchisee to prove any fraudulent behavior – any international misrepresentation - on the part of the franchisor. Moreover, could the franchisee establish his justifiable dependence on the franchisor?  Applying such law-based but practical concerns to the franchise context, courts should acknowledge the special relationship when the franchisor exerts a large amount of control over the franchisee. For example, when the franchisor issues a specific directive to the franchisee with regards to employment choices or another area normally under the banner of “day to day operations.” This level of control normally exposes a franchisor  Privity is defined as “the connection or relationship between two parties, each having a legally recognized interest in the same subject matter.” PrivityLACKICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).

It also creates a “special relationship” between the franchisor and franchisee through agency law because of the franchisors frequent control over its franchisees. This special relationship concept should be transferable to “good faith and fair dealing” claims and allow franchisees to obtain tort damages when relevant. Franchisees in Atypical Commercial Settings     The possibility of recovery is also limited to “special relationships” not covered under the banner of an ordinary commercial setting. These ordinary commercial settings typically involve two businesses contracting for goods, property, or services. This limited group tends to prohibit franchisees from using this claim to recover from franchisors they believe have acted in bad faith. However, it is arguable that franchises are not in an ordinary commercial setting, despite the support of this classification found in current case law.While franchises are relatively common in the modern economy, the method of their creation is not as simple as the start of other businesses or business relationships.      A franchise agreement can be considered a special type of business contract. In Postal Instant Press, Inc. v. Sue Sealy the court noted that while franchises fall under the realm of commercial contracts, they share many of the same attributes as consumer contracts. Specifically, there is an economic inequality between the franchisee and the franchisor that mirrors a consumer-producer relationship. Franchisees are often small business owners operating their first business. This results in an unequal distribution of both a  Cope, 290 P.3d at 320.

While states may enact legislation to protect the small business owner, creating a tort cause of action outside the scope of the franchise agreement will allow further protection.  Some state legislation tries to protect franchisees by treating them as if they were regular small businesses. For example, in California, courts construe the legislative intent of the statutory provision providing protection to small business owners as also protecting those who have entered into a franchise relationship. In Thueson v. U-Haul Int’l, Inc., the franchisee received the protections afforded to other small business owners when U-Haul terminated the dealership. U-Haul prevailed for different reasons, but the law clearly covered small businesses that owned franchises, as opposed to only covering completely separate, non-franchised, or networked small businesses. The franchise relationship deserves this protection because it often involves an unsophisticated and highly dependent party. The relationship is unusual, if not unique, from a combination of a franchisee likely being unsophisticated and extremely dependent on the franchisor to provide intellectual property and guidance. The guidance involves methods of operation, trade secrets, advertisement, and development techniques. Such a reliance on the franchisor’s word further distinguishes a franchise relationship from the ordinary commercial setting. The recognition of this lack of sophistication occurs in realms beyond franchise law. It was even the motivation for various regulations, such as the FTC-mandated disclosures, which  Century 21 Real Estate LLC v. All Professional Realty, Inc., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1217 (E.D.

Some states, most prominently California, have adopted tests that should lead regulators and courts to find many franchises constitute employment: commercial arrangements with the trappings of independent contracting between two business entities but whose hallmark is, in reality, employee-like franchisee dependency.  The California Supreme Court went against its previous ruling and adopted an ABC test to determine that a supposed independent contractor may in fact be an employee. The decision, in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles left many questions unanswered an outcome particularly vexing for some California businesses, including franchisors and franchisees. The state legislature moved to make the Dynamex decision statutory law, with some push from worker advocates and labor unions. The new law goes beyond the Dynamex decision by protecting even more people as employees than were covered under Dynamex In effect, California maintained its lead, and influence, in expanding worker protections to those previously viewed as distinct, typically unprotected independent hires. The state initially became one of the first to codify the ABC test into law, and a few years later, effective January 1, 2020, the California legislature  Lagarias & Kushell, supra note 168, at 6; Press Release, Federal Trade Commission, FTC Seeks Public Comment As Part of Its Review of the Franchise Rule (Feb. 13, 2019), https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-seeks-public-comment-part-its-review-franchise-rule Kelsey Basten, New “ABC” Test for Independent Contractors in California (May 22, 2018), https://www.govdocs.com/new-abc-test-for-independent-contractors-in-california/ (“The test presumes all workers are classified as employees unless the company can demonstrate all three ABC factors are met: 1.

Proponents of protecting independent contractors focus on higher-minimum wages and employer-provided insurance benefits, however, overlook the fact that a franchisee may be operating as a third party. There are times in which the franchisee is the employer and other times where the franchisee is dependent on the franchisor. This may call for a quasi-independent contractor status for the franchisee, affording protections in the proper contexts when necessary. For a discussion on quasi-independent employees, see Mitchell H. Rubenstein, Employees, Employers, and Quasi-Employers: An Analysis of Employees and Employers Who Operate in the Borderland Between an Employer and Employee Relationship, 14 U.L. 605, 606 (2012).   Andrew G. Malik, Worker Classification and the Gig-Economy, 69 RUTGERS U.L.. 1729, 1744 (2017). In Dynamex, the California Supreme Court set forth a new, stringent, three-factor test that is used in determining proper worker classification for purposes of California’s wage order rules. 416 P.3d 1 (Cal. 2018). With analysis rooted in the ABC test, the court held that the burden of proof is on the hirer, who is compelled to meet a very high bar because the worker is presumed to be an employee for California wage order purposes unless all three of the ABC factors exist. Id. enacted “AB-5,” which expands the scope of Dynamex Operations even further. The ongoing policy conflict over “independent” status and employment continues, now even via plebiscites.V. EXPANDING THE OOD AITH AND AIR EALING LAIM    Franchisee dependency is further emphasized because the franchisee’s actions are restricted until the franchisor gives approval. For example, a group of franchisees sued Dunkin’ Donuts for failing to respond to a fall in the Dunkin’ Donuts market share in Quebec, Canada. The franchisees worried that the franchisor would not revitalize the brand and strategy to compete against rising businesses. The franchisees were, in effect, trapped; they tried to adapt without having garnered franchisor approval, and they could have been in violation of franchise agreements. Instead of focusing on what the franchisees had a right to do, the opinion was about what the franchisees had a right to expect from the franchisor. The franchisor did not take into account the market developments: as a result, the franchisor was not innovating and passing on the innovation to the franchisees. The loss of market share incurred by the franchisees violated the essence of the franchise relational contract. The franchisees had a right to ongoing savoir-faire, but were denied such innovation. In effect, the decision permitted franchisees to take matters into their own hands.  While the situation occurred outside the United States’ borders, it still demonstrates an issue that United States-based franchisees can endure. The French concept of “savoir faire[,]” or know-how, was an element  416 P.3d 1 (Cal. 2018).  The California legislature codified the common law ABC test in AB-5 (CAA.B. No. 5 (2019), where workers are now considered to be employees who are “suffered or permitted to work” under wage orders unless the employer is able to establish the three factors of the ABC test. Recall that these factors are: (1) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact; (2) the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business; and (3) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.

Under AB-5, the ABC test was now to be uniformly applied across industries, as an attempt to streamline classification issues.  In a dramatic turn of events and through millions of dollars spent in lobbying, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 22, allowing gig-economy companies to continue treating drivers as independent contractors. Proposition 22 greatly undermines California lawmakers efforts to regulate gig-economy companies, allowing companies such as Uber and Lyft to continue to classify their drivers as independent contractors with limited benefits.

In the Dunkin’ Donuts case, the Quebec Superior Court held that Dunkin’ Donuts was liable to its Quebec franchisees for breach of contract and allowed the franchisees to terminate their leases because of Dunkin’ Brands’ failure to protect its franchisees’ market share by maintaining the strength of their brand in Quebec in the face of “Tim Hortons onslaught.”    The French courts do not have a set definition of savoir-faire but draw from the EC Regulation on vertical agreements,the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR) norm, and the reflections of scholars. For something to be know-how it must have the characteristic of secrecy, substantially, experimentation and identification. There are many courts in different countries that recognize the idea of savoir-faire and have incorporated the idea into their jurisprudence. Franchisees are dependent on franchisors’ know-how, but, in the United States, franchisors are not required to transfer their know-how to their franchisees. France, on the other hand, requires the transfer of know-how in order for the franchisor’s Id.  Bertico Inc. v. Dunkin’ Brands Can. Ltd., 2012 CanLII 2809 (Can. Que. Super. Ct.), aff’d sub nom.

Instead of focusing on what the franchisees had a right to do, the opinion in effect was about what the franchisees had a right to expect from the franchisor. In Bertico, the franchisor was not taking account of market developments and was therefore not innovating and passing on the innovation to the franchisees; this violated the essence of the franchise relational contract. The franchisees had a right to this ongoing savoir-faire. One can conclude that Bertico implicitly gave permission for ignored, unaided franchisees to take matters into their own hands (e.g., foregoing the payment of royalties, suing the franchisee for damages, leaving the franchise network).  “Savoir” is a verb meaning “to know.” Laura K.

The amount of know-how a franchisor is willing to share with potential franchisees, to attract them, varies from company to company. A study of 100 franchises showed that 67% of the franchises polled had all training costs at franchisee’s expense and 94% would willingly continue to provide consulting services, after training is completed, for a fee.    Notice the similarities between the insurer-insured and franchisor-franchisee relationships. The insured is entirely dependent on the insurer performing its end of the bargain when there is a need for coverage. In the event the insurer fails to perform in good faith, the insured has little recourse other than through the insurer. The insured cannot seek other insurance companies for protection and an honoring of the policy. This is applicable to the franchise context as well. If the franchise agreement is not honored by the franchisor, the franchisee is not likely to be able to apply any of the equipment, inventory, or trade secrets to any other franchise. For example, a former McDonalds franchisee may not be able to use anything from his former franchise if he or she becomes a Burger King franchisee. Indeed, the ex-franchisee is typically barred for some time from any significant form of competition against the former franchisor. These non-compete clauses are common in franchise agreements of other countries as well and aim to protect the knowledge and goodwill of franchisors. These clauses often apply throughout the entire duration of the franchise agreement, not exclusively after the agreement has been terminated.    Another reason to expand the good faith and fair dealing claim is to allow franchisees to act in the event the contract is not yet created or has expired. Franchising is an expanding business model and, therefore, the  Emerson, supra note 147at 643; see also Odavia Bueno Diaz, FRANCHISING IN UROPEAN ONTRACT (2008)(indicating the importance of know-how being communicated at the beginning of the relationship and for the duration of the contract).

Franchise agreements may be stuffed with confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements, and other restrictive covenants that legally prevent the franchisee from moving forward in the market. The skills and training taught to the franchisee could be applied outside of that specific franchise, but the franchisee may have to change its location and industry or wait until the restrictions expire.

ROM/30 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018). cases of franchisor opportunism are growing in frequency. Almost all cases of franchisee abuse occur after the contract is signed – a time period that is likely to be outside the scope of any franchise negotiations. Since the abuse often lies outside of the terms of the agreement or the duration thereof, the franchisee may have to rely on tort law to seek recourse.     One example that requires the expansion of the implied covenant is when the franchisor opens a franchise near another franchisee. This “encroachment” issue is prevalent in the franchise context and is often considered the “number one problem” for franchisees. Unless the contract provides a regional clause, the franchisee cannot rely on the terms of the contract to protect himself or herself. Additionally, a novice or inexperienced franchisee may not even be aware that a franchisor has the authority to take such action. This exposes a major policy concern that the expansion of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing will address.     Consider encroachment. There are numerous examples, such as that of Steven Scheck, who entered a franchise agreement with Burger King. Scheck believed he had been wronged when the franchisor approved a franchise opening roughly two miles away from his franchise. Similarly, Joseph Davis, the franchise applicant that was approved by Burger King, was told prior to signing the franchise agreement, that the only other franchise “on the board” was located far enough to have no effect on his franchises. A third example involves Zuri Barnes, who claimed that he was completely unaware that the franchisor’s policy was to build “restaurants ‘wherever [it felt] there [was] a potential customer base to support the viability of all parties concerned[.]’” The cases involving Scheck and Barnes are not unique occurrences, and these type of lawsuits  Steinberg & Lecastre, supra note 179, at 106.

It is interesting to note that Scheck had believed that the two-mile protection was violated. Scheck, 756 F. Supp. at 545 (“Plaintiff has stated that he suffered compensable damages caused by Burger King’s decision to sanction the . . . Burger King franchise two miles away from Scheck’s franchise . . . .”).  can send shockwaves through the franchise industry. However, both Davis and Barnes were experienced franchisees, and it is unclear why they assumed regional exclusivity would come with their franchise agreements.    Regardless of their own reasons, it is often quite reasonable for franchisees to believe that they will have some exclusivity or other protections involving costs, markets, or the like. A franchisee is told of this tried-and-true system for operating a business, and the franchisee is aware that franchisees reputedly have a higher success rate than people who open small, completely independent businesses without the benefit of a franchise network and usually sans the franchisee’s trademark protection and other advantages, including regional, national or even international recognition. Is it a crazy leap of faith for a franchisee to think that his or her franchisor would not authorize a direct competitor within a mile of its location? From the perspective of a consumer, both locations offer the same quality; so, why should one travel farther to one franchise location rather than the other? In these situations, owning your own business can quickly turn into a nightmare scenario of being trapped in a failing business.     Encroachment is not the only realm in which a franchisee may argue that there was a breach of the good faith and fair dealing covenant. There are a variety of operational claims involving “failure to provide training and support,” misuse of advertising funds, and poor-pricing claims. Also, a franchisor can breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to cooperate in the franchisee’s performance, doing something that injuries the franchisee in his or her right to receive the benefits of the franchise agreement, acting contrary to Franchisee Sues Burger King, UPI (May 5, 1994), https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/05/05/Franchisee-sues-Burger-King/2060768110400/ (noting the significance of the Barnes lawsuit).   One of the issues in dispute for Barnes’s lawsuit was that the franchisor intentionally failed to inform Barnes that the “2-mile policy” he believed was in effect was in fact false. Barnes, 932 F. Supp. at 1423 (“[T]here is some dispute as to whether the [franchisor’s sales and service manager] was specifically instructed not to [correct] Barnes.”).  Franchisees are expected to operate within a community – i.e., a system overseeing a network of franchisees and, typically, company units.

The court in Wojcik v. InterArch, Inc. held that a franchisor could be held liable for breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing if the franchisor gives itself broad discretion over the franchisor’s performance and does not exercise good faith in the discretion. In Pennsylvania, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not implied in every contract as it is in the UCC. Judge Pratter dismissed the franchisee’s claim for breach of implied covenant in Azmi Takiedine v. 7-Eleven, Inc. because the franchisee had continued to operate his franchise.    In the United States, franchisors can be held accountable for a particular abuse of their power or more general wrongs. For the former, the U.S. District Court of Connecticut provided a good example by holding that a franchisor undermined its franchisees’ operations by selling products through supermarkets. As to more general “infractions,” almost any failure to provide the typical goods or services can be the basis for a claim against the franchisor. The franchisor’s training, support, and overall expertise, which are to be provided initially and on an ongoing basis to the franchisee, constitute one of the most important features of franchising, going to the heart of franchise economic viability as a going concern. The covenant of good faith and fair dealing has similarly found that franchisors breached the covenant by not providing such support,  Catherine Pastrikos Kelly, What You Should Know About The Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, ABA (July 26, 2016),https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/business-torts-unfair-competition/practice/2016/duty-of-good-faith-fair-dealing/.

J. 87, 87 (2016). even where the support was not contractually guaranteed.    Consider further that the franchisee is already extremely limited by his bargaining power and knowledge. As noted above, normally the franchisee is provided with a “take-it-or-leave-it” agreement and is unable to negotiate regional protection. In another scenario, the franchisee may not be aware such a problem exists. Many franchisees fail to hire, from the outset (or maybe even at all), the independent legal counsel they truly need before seriously contemplating and entering into a franchise agreement. Some individuals seek online help from websites such as “Legal Zoom” without even considering the possibility that the franchisor might place a competing franchise in close proximity. Thus, if the franchise agreement does not, for whatever reason, have a clause addressing the issue, a franchisee must rely on an award outside of the realm of contract law.      Another example of uncontracted terms is an implied term to take reasonable measures to help support the brand and the franchisees relying on it. The implied duty of ongoing support is recognized domestically and internationally, but what is expected is rather vague. There are some instances in which the franchisor may include a provision regarding ongoing support. However, when there is no discussion of the term, the implied covenant may be vital to assisting a wronged franchisee.      The final reason to divert from the original rule and allow for tort-based franchisee claims is to discourage franchisors from breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In the event the franchisor does breach the covenant or take actions similar thereto, the franchisee is limited in damages despite any willful or malicious actions the franchisor may have taken.

With respect to franchisors, the allowance of tort damages can be used as a weapon against free riding. Franchisees engaged in free riding can be viewed as breaching the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” A franchisee might free ride by lowering its cost and the quality of its goods or services.Franchisors can admonish against this behavior by threatening to bring tort damages. Tort damages, however, must be weighed against the appearance of immediate economic benefit to the franchisees who are free riding. A franchisee may decide to free ride because free-riding can allow it to keep charging the same prices as the other franchisees while lowering the quality of its products or services. The free-riding franchisee  This might serve as a counterweight to the highly restrictive parameters for “good faith and fair dealing” so often set forth in the franchise agreements and disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs).  The author’s review of 500 FDDs from the year 2020 – covering all industries (including lodging, restaurants, services, education, exercise, and other fields), all regions, and close to one-sixth of all extant U.S. franchise systems – found that over half of them – 270 – had clauses specifically stating that the franchisee waived any claims for a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the express (quite pro-franchisor) terms of the franchise agreement negated any possible contrary terms under an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or that no covenant will imply any rights or duties inconsistent with a fair construction of the agreement’s provisions.

Enforcement of any proscription against free-riding may be limited to tort damages for breaching the “covenant of good faith and fair dealing” – in effect, for instance, reversing, with a damages award, a bad-faith termination by the franchisor.    Generally, free-riding by one franchisee weakens the potential power of the franchise group as a whole.In the long haul, this causes non-free-riders to experience a decrease in value and loss of profits. Franchisors may try to prevent free-riding by charging high fees upfront and regulating decision making. This strategy affects all franchisees, even potential franchisees that follow the standards. Instead of taking preventative measures, franchisors can rely on the tort-enhanced implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.     The question then becomes: When would a court find a breach of the implied covenant? One approach is to consider what behavior lacks good faith, based on an objective, case-by-case analysis. Referred to as the “excluder approach,” some common actions are “evasion of the spirit of the bargain, lack of diligence . . .,  “[T]he individual franchisee incurs only part of the reputational costs suffered by the franchise brand name due to her free-riding behavior.” Id. at 1183.

In a case-by-case approach, courts could also examine whether the franchisee has “recourse in the marketplace” or some other way to mitigate damages. A downside to this approach is that the boundaries of good faith are very ambiguous, which prevents a plaintiff or defendant from knowing what may trigger an “evasion of the spirit of the bargain.” However, a court may rely on guidance from insurance-related litigation, where a key public interest favoring tort recovery is to deter bad faith handling of insurance claims.    If courts intend to utilize the recourse factor, the focus should be on the “economic dilemma” that a wronged franchisee or franchisor may face. This factor would be more helpful in a franchisee claim because a franchisor naturally has more recourse than a franchisee. The franchisor can revoke the intellectual property licenses and move on to the next franchisee; a franchisee lacks that same luxury. Additionally, it is dangerous to end the analysis at that point because the dilemma (the lack of any real recourse) must have worse financial effects than a “normal breach.” Without deterring intervention, a faithless franchisor might have the opportunity to lie, cheat, scheme, and defraud without any possibility of repercussion in excess of where the franchisor would have been if not for the unethical practices: in effect, it allows franchisors to get away with what they can and pay after the fact for what they cannot. An award of tort damages, on the other hand, would markedly change the risk calculus for a franchisor considering such practices.      The reasonable expectations of the parties is another approach that policymakers may undertake. Just as important, it strikes a fair balance between two parties with different levels of bargaining power. California courts have considered this approach in the insurance context because of the power disparity between the two parties. Generally, the insured party signs what may be considered a contract of adhesion that  Diamond & Foss, supra note 214, at 591.  at 592. One may argue that “good cause” for termination, through court analysis over time, has actually become a clearer standard in terms of actual, collective judicial holdings. Emerson, supra note 27.

However, if the insured has legal sophistication or a closer level of bargaining power to the franchisor’s, the protection is not needed as much. A sophisticated or comparable franchisee will have a reasonable expectation that is closely aligned with, or at least cognizant of, the goals and behavior of the franchisor. Rightful franchisee expectations could be for successfully owning and operating the franchised business; earning a reasonable, hopefully optimal, return on that franchise investment; and buying into a prosperous system or brand. Franchisors should be expected to meet such expectations, if reasonable and not violative of any express contractual obligations. They may do so out of their own sense of fairness (of good faith and fair dealing) and because that is in keeping with not just the franchisee’s needs, but also the long-term interests of the franchised system as a whole.    The next issue to consider is the actual award of punitive damages. Punitive damages themselves are treated as a last resort when compensatory damages will not suffice. Normally, franchise litigation falls under the auspices of contract law, which typically does not award punitive damages. However, sometimes egregious actions in franchise law may result in a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Furthermore, the shocking conduct may be sufficient to carry the award of punitive damages.  One “guidepost” the Supreme Court considered when awarding punitive damages is how reprehensible the defendant’s conduct was (hereinafter, the “reprehensibility analysis”). Within that analysis, the Supreme Court mentioned three factors that are relevant in the franchisee’s situation. The first factor is whether the target of the defendant’s conduct was financially vulnerable. The second factor measures whether the defendant’s conduct involved repeated actions or isolated action. Lastly, courts should examine whether the plaintiff’s harm  AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 799 P.2d 1253, 1265 (Cal. 1990). id.

Id. at 419.  was the result of malice, trickery, or deceit.    The franchisee may be financially vulnerable during the beginning of the franchise relationship. However, the franchisee is undoubtedly bound financially to the franchisor throughout the duration of and perhaps beyond the franchise agreement. Franchisees rely on franchisors to provide business guidance and other assistance, such as the furnishing of training materials or goods. It is this provision that makes franchising so appealing to some would-be “entrepreneurs” who want to own and run a business, but also want a network, a valuable trademark, and advice – some institutional “handholding.” The strength of the franchise and the franchisor is a major determinant of the franchisee’s success. Therefore, the franchisee is financially vulnerable to the actions of the franchisor. Indeed, any actions that are outside the covenant of good faith and fair dealings can have a negative impact on either party.    Consider a situation in which the franchisor refuses to renew the franchise agreement and thereby affects a financially vulnerable franchisee. For some franchises, a franchisee will need to invest somewhere in the range of $300,000 to $600,000. With that being just the initial investment, the franchisee is also obligated to pay royalties and, perhaps, to order from specific manufacturers and vendors at the franchisor’s discretion. This may result in the franchisee paying a higher price than what it would pay from an alternative source. After all of these payments, the franchisee is no doubt duty bound and economically exposed to the franchisor. The franchisee may not see profit to make back that initial investment until two or three years after the business  Diane G.P. Flannery and Jason T.

Laws regarding the breach of the good faith covenant are not specific to the United States. Article 7 of Peru’s Antitrust Law outlines circumstances under which a financially dominant party has abused its position. María del Carmen Alvarado, Peru, inNTERNATIONAL RANCHISING PER/1, PER/11 (Dennis Campbell, 2d ed., 2018).  Suing a franchisor for failure to renew without cause is a common occurrence. Franchisees are often frustrated when they are forced to terminate their businesses without a valid reason from the franchisor. For an example, see McDonald’s Corp. v. Markim, Inc., 306 N.W.2d 158 (Neb. 1981) (stating the franchisees operated the franchise 196 to 1980).

All of these considerations tie a franchisee to its franchisor and demonstrate the financial vulnerability that a court considers. A reprehensibility analysis may also be undertaken against a backdrop of franchise ethics. Codes of ethics, such as those from the International Franchise Association and the British Franchise Association, have, inter alia, the purpose of providing a baseline for handling franchise disputes. When a franchisor has its own personally-tailored franchise code of ethics, a court may use those ethical guidelines to set the boundaries of good faith and fair dealing. In the pursuit of fairness, while interpreting the ethics codes, a court should recognize the franchisee’s vulnerabilities, examine the traditional behavior between parties, and, if possible, determine the industry norms. Note, however, that franchise relationships can be unique, so the court should be wary when considering how a franchisor interacts with a variety of franchisees. Industry norms can be complicated as well because of the wide variety of franchise concepts.      Whether the franchisor repeats its conduct against the same plaintiff-franchisee is the second consideration. In other words, even if a franchisor committed the same breach of good faith against multiple and unrelated franchisees, the courts would restrict their focus on the conduct against that specific plaintiff. However, if a group of franchisees banded together, courts would be allowed to consider the repetition of actions across various franchise agreements, assuming that all franchisees are in business with the same franchisor. Furthermore, the financial benefit of “combining” the franchisees’ contentions would increase the odds of a franchisor’s being held accountable for its bad faith actions.    Collaboration by plaintiffs might be blocked by non-disclosure agreements prohibiting the discussion of trade secrets, proprietary information, or information that the franchisor deems to be confidential.

The disparity in bargaining power may allow the franchisor to prohibit discussions of franchising prices or other franchise-related information. Such a prohibition would make investigating a breach of good faith and fair dealing even more difficult and costly for the franchisees.     Lastly, the court must examine the subjective intent of the alleged wrongdoer. Has the franchisor or franchisee acted in the spirit of the franchise agreement? This should not be a cursory examination. To find a lack of malicious intent does not, alone, mean that the party acted in good faith. As noted in Harlow v. Fitzgerald “inquiry into subjective motivation . . . may entail broad-ranging discovery . . . .” With the burden of proof riding on the shoulders of the franchisee, any saved costs from grouping with other franchisees would simply be categorized anew for the intent investigation. The presence of nondisclosure agreements once again could pose challenges for discovering a franchisor’s wrongful, or at least lacking in good faith, intent.      Fraudulent disclosure can exist in a number of different ways, like when a franchisor does not disclose a fact that he or she is aware that the other party does not know, the fact could not be discovered by ordinary investigation, or the other party could not be reasonably expected to discover the fact, and if the other party had known the nondisclosed fact he or she would not have entered into the agreement.Protections AbroadThroughout the world, suits may be brought challenging the nondisclosure or inaccurate disclosure of relevant information. In Europe, for example, a franchisee may have a claim of action against a franchisor for damages from, or other remedies for, franchisor nondisclosure or incomplete disclosure. Some nations may adopt a high barrier to franchisee actions, such as that found in  Taiwan’s Principle for Handling Cases Relating  The Uniform Trade Secrets Act states that a trade secret is information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, etc. that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to others who could obtain economic value from learning the information and the holder of the trade secret is making some sort of effort to keep the information secret.

Taiwan requires disclosure by franchisors, but further provides that a franchisee’s claim based on nondisclosure must prove intentional malfeasance or nonfeasance.In April 2020, Saudi Arabia’s new franchise law took effect. The language of the new law is ambiguous when dealing with disclosure and registration violations. The law appears to offer two options to the franchisee in the case of a breach, either terminate or demand compensation. If there is a violation of the registration and disclosure provisions then Article 19 requires franchisors to compensate the franchisee for losses suffered because of the violation, but Article 19 prohibits the franchisee from terminating the franchise relationship. On the other hand, Article 17 allows a franchisee to terminate the franchise relationship if there is a material breach of the registration and disclosure obligation, but Article 17 does not allow for a franchisee to receive compensation for the breach.Finally, potential punitive damages may also motivate the franchisor to exhibit its best behavior. Franchisors are able to purchase insurance protecting against “defense costs and settlement.” However, only about 20% of franchisors carry franchise-litigation insurance.i. Good Faith Globally, many jurisdictions have taken approaches influenced by German and French interpretations of the duty of good faith on both parties. Saudi Arabia’s new law will require the franchisor to act in good faith and will apply to pre-existing agreements. Canada, for example, in addition to disclosure requirements placed on the franchisor, imposes on each party to the agreement a duty of good faith in dealing in performance and enforcement of the agreement. The remedy for a breach of the duty of fair dealing is the right to bring an  The Principle, published by Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission, focus on harm to the public interest and – unlike Taiwan’s Civil Code, which focuses on harm to private interests – the Fair Trade Law demands that there be a “harmful effect on the franchise market order.” Wellington Liu, I-Chen Wu & David Lu, Taiwan, in INTERNATIONAL RANCHISE ALES supra note 294, at 475, 497.

Mr. Submarine Ltd.provides an example of bad faith in the context of the special relationship that is formed between franchisor and franchisee. The franchisor abandoned the franchisee when it was experiencing operation difficulties and violated a legal obligation to assist the franchisee. The court awarded punitive damages because the franchisor violated the duties of good faith and fair dealing and “betrayed the trust that symbolizes the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee.Further, in Canada, an entire agreement clause does not preclude a review to determine whether the parties have complied with the expectation of honesty in performance.Denmark has a similar approach, in which the parties in the franchise relationship are held to standards of “good practice” and concerns the initial stages of the franchise, the ongoing relationship, and the minimum terms of the franchise agreement. There are also obligations on the franchisor that they must have operated the business concept with at least one pilot store for a reasonable time before establishing the franchise system. Training the franchisee is required and continued commercial technical assistance given throughout the relationship. Taking from the French, Danish law also acknowledges that know-how is an important element of a business and encompasses the information and technology required for the franchisee to complete business or certain processes.    The English approach is unique in that there are no specific safeguards for franchisees that are not generally available to all persons entering commercial contracts. There is no general duty to act in good faith in contracts, but in Yam Send Pte, Ltd. v. Int’l Trade Corp., Ltd., the court acknowledged that while the duty of good faith is not implied in every commercial contract, elements may be implied in contracts involving long-term relationships between the parties who have made a substantial commitment. While this was not a franchise case, the court indicated that franchise agreements are “relational contracts” and that franchisors will  Katotikidis v. Mr. Submarine Ltd., [2002] O.J.

Further, if a franchisor has the power to make unilateral decisions, they must exercise that power honestly and in good faith for which the power was conferred. A franchisee, however, may have the remedy of the tort of negligence, if the court finds that the franchisor owed a duty of care to the prospective franchisee. Franchisors are likely to owe a prospective franchisee a duty of care when giving estimates of potential profits or turnover rates that may affect the franchisee. Inaccurate information may lead to the tort of negligent misstatement.Courts are divided on the issue of implying good faith into contracts. The law does not impose an implied duty of good faith in commercial contracts, but the Code of Ethics requires the franchisee and the franchisor to exercise fairness in their dealings with each other and to resolve complaints, grievances, and disputes with good faith.”The Carewatch Care Services Ltd v. Focus Caring Services Ltd. court dismissed a franchisee’s argument that there was an implied good faith requirement in the franchise agreement and held that the franchise agreement was detailed about the franchise relationship making it unnecessary to imply any additional terms into it. Other cases have gone the other way, though. In Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Saeed Bin Shakhboot Al Nehayan, the court held that parties to an oral joint venture agreement had to act in good faith towards the other party. Also, in Bates v Post Office, the court held that all “relational” contracts should apply a duty of good faith towards the parties. This case included guidance on what a “relational” contract is; indeed, under the guidance provided, a franchise agreement is included as a “relational” contract.Israel has an approach to good faith that is modeled greatly after the U.S. and Europe.

The franchisor has a similar “know-how” requirement as seen in other countries, obligating them to provide the franchisee with business guidance and financial guidance.Italy imposes similar requirements on the franchisor as seen in France. The franchisor is bound to confer on the franchisee the know-how and confidential knowledge that comes from the franchisor’s own experience. A general description of know-how should be sufficient at the preliminary negotiation stage, and further details given in an operations manual. There are remedies outside of the contract if the franchisor is incorrect or false information was given to the prospective franchisee during negotiations. Portugal takes franchisee protections a step further, as there is no specific law applicable to franchise agreements, and applies general statutory regimes to impose the principle of good faith in franchise agreements.Franchisors have fought to replace good faith and fair dealing with a franchising Business Judgment Rule (“BJR”) protecting the party making decisions in the interest of the business entity (i.e., the franchisor acting for the franchise network). BJR could provide clarity and lessen litigation. In the corporate context, the law only requires that a party “acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” There is no requirement to act in the best interest of the contract, which is required by the good faith and fair dealing covenant. In fact, allowing a personally-interested decision may undermine the duty of care.BJR is not limited to the corporate context and the relationship between boards of directors and . at ISR/10. . at ISR/11.

For example, it can reach partnerships formed under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.Additionally, if applied in franchising cases, the fact-intensive nature of the rule would allow courts to perform, as in corporate BJR, a balancing test.    The umbrella of duty of care and loyalty is wide. Shifting BJR to the franchise context, the franchisor would substitute for the director and the franchise system for the corporation. BJR could allow the franchisor to protect its interests and sustain the franchise. Perhaps, the cynic may opine, the rule gives franchisors the ability to act in bad faith as long as the action can be hidden under the guise of BJR. Doubtless the franchisor may have legitimate reasons to take an action, but that decision may harm either a single franchisee or a more substantial number of franchisees. Generally, BJR could protect these decisions made by a franchisor and lead to a presumption that decisions were not made with abusive discretion. What about the franchisees? Do franchisees have a benefit or at least a way to overcome BJR?      Since BJR is merely a presumption, such as in corporate law, the presumption can be shifted. In the franchise context, shifting the presumption could occur when a franchisor makes a decision in bad faith or breaches a fiduciary duty. Some franchises have started to put BJR into the franchise agreement.Franchisees may find an argument when trying to prevent BJR from replacing the standard of good faith and fair dealing. BJR may be harder to apply in the franchise context because, if a franchisor makes a decision out of self-interest, which is quite common, then the rule cannot be applied. Decisions to switch brands, expand products, or re-locate may be self-interested decisions made by the franchisor without any clear benefit to the franchisee. All of these actions could lead to BJR being insurmountable. While inconvenient, such decisions may not necessarily be “bad faith, fraud, illegality, or gross overreaching.” So, a good faith and fair dealing standard may still stand in part because franchisors must act in good faith, no matter what standard is used.

Many courts review the franchisor’s decisions by applying the good faith and fair dealing standard. In Stone v. Ritter the Delaware Supreme Court stated, “to act in good faith alone does not establish an independent fiduciary duty that stands on the same footing as the duties of care and loyalty.” This breaks the chain between the covenant of good faith and fair dealing leading into a fiduciary duty and allows the application of BJR. In the franchise context, it has long been the standard that franchisors are not fiduciaries. This is in line with provisions specified in franchise agreements and disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs).However, the adoption of BJR could have some positive aspects as it would prevent ill-willed franchisees from taking action against a franchisor for simply acting to preserve the franchise network as a whole. If a franchisor takes advantage of such a provision and places it in the franchise agreement, the implied covenant will be blocked out.  ii. Fair Dealing In many jurisdictions around the world, franchise legislation has been enacted to impose a general obligation of fair dealing on performance and enforcement of franchise agreements. In Canada, the legislation sets out franchise disclosure laws that require fair dealings. To fulfill the duty of fair dealing, a franchisor must perform its contractual duties, and enforce the franchise agreement, all the while taking the franchisees’ interest into account. Before making a system-wide change, a franchisor needs to consider the entire franchise network’s interest, not only the individual franchisee’s interest, and the franchisor should conduct a “meaningful consultation” with the franchisees. According to the Canadian common law courts, a franchisor breaches the duty of fair dealing by unduly withholding information with the intent to make the franchisee not exercise the  Schnell & Gardner, supra note 303, at 180.   911 A.2d 362 (Del. 2006).

Also, the duty of fair dealing is breached when a franchisor unreasonably or abusively exercises its termination rights. Case law has provided guidance on the duty of fair dealing, but the law around this area is not set in stone. This duty does not override unequivocal contract terms, so the duty of fair dealing might be mitigated by franchise agreement provisions.The French approach to the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is a bit different than what is practiced in the United States. Specifically, in France, franchisor development schedules and business plans that do not live up to the “promise” can be grounds for liability. Because of the potential liability for franchisors and this special “expectation” claim, business plans should be avoided and left to the franchisee’s sole responsibility. The franchisor in France must be careful about ratios which are used to draft the franchisee’s business plan. These ratios are handed out to franchisees and if the franchisor validates or keeps silent regarding the resulting business plan, their liability is “practically certain.” The possibility of liability is implicated in an effort to preserve the interest of the franchisee in franchising.     The principle of good faith and fair dealing has not always been uniformly used in France, but recently, has been applied not only to the performance of the contract but also to pre-contractual negotiations and during the post-termination phase. In October 2016, French Civil Code was amended to include article 1.1.4, which states that “[a]ll contracts must be negotiated, created and performed in good faith. This obligation is a matter of public order.” The obligation of good faith can never be excused. In line with the know-how requirements of savoir-faire, franchisors are required—from formation to the termination of the contract—to Floriani, Carnevale & Nakhoul, supra note 4, at 8-9.  Id. at 9.   Although different jurisdictions have various interpretations of the duty of good faith, the French and German good faith standards have inspired many jurisdictions around the world, including Belgium, Austria, Poland, and Spain.

In order for pre-contractual bad faith to be actionable, other tort requirements must be fulfilled: the damage must have been caused by the bad act, the damage must be certain, and it must be yet uncompensated. This is based in the obligation to repair damage caused by one’s act or failure to act. See Nadia E. Nedzel, A Comparative Study of Good Faith, Fair Dealing, and Precontractual Liability, 12 TULANE ORUM 97, 115 (1998).

Furthermore, a party that has acted in bad faith cannot require the performance of the other party.Australia is a common law jurisdiction, similar to the United States, in which principles followed by the courts of one state may be different than principles followed in another state. Generally, Australian franchises must comply with the Franchising Code and are subject to numerous legal requirements and require careful drafting of franchise agreements. The Franchising Code’s purpose is to assist franchisees in making informed decisions before entering into a franchise agreement and to provide a framework for a workable relationship between the parties. Civil penalties will be imposed for breaches of the Franchising Code, including lack of proper documents disclosed to prospective franchisees, not complying with the obligation to act in good faith, not updating financial disclosure documents, proper notice with respect to term arrangements, and copies of all material documents. The New South Wales Court of Appeal held, “the concept of good faith had to be accepted on the basis that it represented the current ‘expected standard’.” Exercise of discretion should be consistent with the overall purpose of the agreement and not contrary to the nature of the agreement.  When determining whether there was a breach of the duty of good faith, courts may consider whether the party acted honestly and not arbitrarily and whether the party cooperated to achieve the purpose of the agreement. Importantly, this does not prevent a party from acting in its legit commercial interests and does not require a franchisor to extend an agreement at the end of its term. The Franchising Code is stringent with requirements and the duties for both parties, including marketing requirements, financial information disclosures, leasing information, transfer restrictions, circumstances for termination, and dealing with former franchisees.Common law jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, and the United States, to one extent or another, have embraced a notion of good faith as an implied obligation in contracts—even though there is variation in the details and application.

On June 30, 2020, the Dutch Senate enacted a national Franchise Act, the first of its kind in the Netherlands. The Franchise Act became effective on January 1, 2021 and it regulates the sales of franchises while imposing a “good behavior” standard for franchisors and franchisees, requiring reasonableness in actions depending on the type of industry and the size of the franchise chain. There are specific provisions regarding prior consent and goodwill that franchisors opposed as restricting business and stifling innovation. These provisions are mandatory, and a franchise agreement cannot deviate from the requirements established in the Franchise Act, regardless of the law governing the franchise arrangement.The aim of the Dutch Franchise Act is to provide more balance in the franchisor-franchisee relationship by offering statutory protections to the franchisee. The parties should behave toward each other as a “good franchisor” and a “good franchisee.” The Act’s opponents questioned  whether such statutory protection is needed, as both the franchisor and the franchisee already had to behave in accordance with Civil Law principles of reasonableness and fairness. It is unclear how this will affect existing franchise relationships and how franchisors will react to this very pro-franchisee law, but it is a significant step toward codifying the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing inherent in all contracts.  ONCLUSION    Overall, most rules for franchising – statutes, regulations, and case law – tend to be franchisor-friendly.Franchisors can take risks without the fear that, ordinarily, courts will second-guess the decision and impose liability or sanctions for the franchisors’ actions.Given this predisposition in favor of the franchisor’s contract, as the franchisor intended it, the courts, regulators, or legislators could, and probably should, impose a duty of “faithfulness to an agreed common  Benjamin B.

See Emerson & Benoliel, supra note 123, at 105 (noting that all federal-level franchisee protection laws have been rejected and only a small number of states enacted general franchisee protection laws). By contrast, France’s laws are more franchisee-friendly. See Robert W. Emerson, Franchising Constructive Termination: Quirk, Quagmire or a French Solution?, 18 U.L. 163 (2015).  Selman, supra note 66, at 112.  purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party.” This or similar covenants of good faith and fair dealing are underutilized methods of recovery for franchisees. The hesitance is only reinforced by the courts’ hesitance to breach precedent and the difficulty of outlining the boundaries of what constitutes good faith. Courts are hesitant to rewrite contracts. Franchise agreements are not signed overnight and, regardless of the potential franchisee’s sophistication, a franchisee does have an opportunity to review the terms and accept, negotiate for changes, or even simply toss the draft agreement in the trash. The argument thus goes, should a franchisor be bound to presumably fairer (to franchisees) contract terms simply to make up for franchisees’ mistakes, often, at least at the outset, franchisees’ lack of due diligence when buying a franchise.Expansion of franchising requires the law, and the judges, to adapt to circumstances, to the age of disruption. While using the “blue pencil” may not necessarily be the answer, some sort of judicial quill should be used. Franchisees and franchisors may not act in the spirit of the contract, and the traditional contract damages may not be sufficient to remedy the situation. For example, how can a franchisee or franchisor recover in the event of actions that are not prohibited by the contract, but nevertheless harm either side of the agreement?      To move the franchise law towards more franchisee protections would be in line with some regulatory trends. This would also not be the first time in which policy overruled the freedom of contract. Consider the freedom of “master over employee” that was once held in the highest esteem. Courts and legislatures have determined that it is not an absolute right, and courts do have the ability to take policy considerations into account when dealing with contract enforcement.    In the modern era, protection of franchisees is likely to take a back seat to other issues. The last major economic substantive due process intervention occurred during a nationwide low point when the courts believed that protection of the overworked employee was a major policy concern. In contrast, franchising has been a rapidly growing sector of the economy and franchisees generally have a higher likelihood of success than their  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 205 cmt. a (1981).

Note, it is unlikely for this change to occur at the federal level. When Lochner v. New York was decided, it signaled a rapid decline in federal intervention in the economy. This was known as the Lochner Era. See Barry Cushman, Teaching the Lochner Era, 62 SOUIS L.J. 537 (2018). As the Great Depression took its toll, the Supreme Court was more willing to intervene and this demonstrated a growth employment protection. However, in modern day, the Supreme Court has changed again and it is believed that another Lochner Era is quickly approaching.

In comparison, business franchises were rightly considered prone to danger—a wild, often lawless place until the 1970s, when California and other states enacted franchising legislation.    In the current legal environment, the optimal approach would be court adoption of a stronger, expanded implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It invokes an already-existing legal doctrine that can be applied to the franchise world with little disruption. It allows parties to be protected from issues not specifically covered in the contract. Franchisees and franchisors can take comfort in knowing that, if they are blindsided, they can recover. By adopting a standard test for franchising good faith and fair dealing, courts may be better able to delineate the boundaries of appropriate conduct and provide a stronger deterrent to bad faith behavior.

Monopoly Control by Government Ownership of a Franchisor David Emerson PhD 63 Crown Street Woolloomooloo 2011 Australia Telephone: +6147443358  Email :  davide@tpg.com.au Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 25-26, 2021 Monopoly Control by Government Ownership of a Franchisor Abstract This paper examines the capacity of franchising to control monopoly behaviour in the private sector, a question first asked in the 1950s but not apparently answered or examined further by government or academia. It is shown that franchising has the power to control prices and quality and that the franchisee does not have monopolistic opportunities. The results of a doctoral thesis on Dolomiti SuperSki, which examined the only known Community Franchise, is used to show how a government-owned franchise operates and the alignment of interests that it embodies. The differences between private and government ownership of a franchise is shown to have implications for franchisees and the general public. A government-owned franchise is more answerable to those within the geographic area of any jurisdiction and if the government owns the franchisor then its interests align with those of the market being served. This paper raises those original questions on monopoly control first asked last century and concludes that it is a question that could usefully receive some further attention.   Key words: (monopoly, franchising, Community Franchise) Monopoly Control by Government Ownership of a Franchisor Introduction In the middle of last century, it was speculated that franchising held some promise as a means for a Government to exercise control over abuses of monopoly power in open markets (Loeb and Magat, 1979, Demsetz, 1968). Apart from some attention in the cable TV market in the US (Hazlett, 1991, Williamson, 1976, Prager, 1990) where the treatment is focused on problems peculiar to that industry, there is little or no indication that this line of thought has been pursued for economic activity generally or even for government attention. However, it was an idea considered to be a prospective area of study at that time (Sharkey, 1979). In researching business models of public transport for my doctoral thesis, it became evident that this issue could be usefully reconsidered.  Monopolies occur where a dominant participant in a market achieves a position so powerful it can exploit pricing and its control of resource allocation to maximize its own shareholder’s value. A market suffering from control by a single dominant participant will not be able to resist moves by that dominant participant in adjusting prices, controlling suppliers and generally manipulating the market to force out competitors. This disrupts normal competition between separate commercial entities and benefits only the operators and shareholders of that monopoly company, frequently to the detriment of society (Kemp, 2015).   This paper examines questions of control of monopoly behaviour through the mechanism of a government-owned franchise. It reviews franchise structure, their history and operations. It then provides details of a community-owned franchise where the franchisor, owned on behalf of a geographically defined area or jurisdiction, maintains effective support and control over multiple privately-owned franchisees in the provision of ski lifting services in the Italian Dolomites. This regime is known from here on as a Community Franchise, which is the name used by Dolomiti SuperSki, the originators and controllers of this system. Seeing this unreported and unusual business model of public transport network of ski lifting was the stimulus to my doctoral study that resulted in a hypothetical application of this franchise regime to urban public transport ( (Emerson, 2020), Emerson et al., 2015). The Community Franchise regime is described and then analyzed for its capacity to control aspects of what is normally a service with monopoly tendencies (White, 2013, Evans, 1991). Those issues that are important to government and passengers are identified and the effects of the regime on these factors are analyzed before conclusions are drawn.  Franchise Structures Franchise regimes in the wider economy are generally private companies that seek the capital and operational expertise of others in the running and expansion of their businesses (Hoffman and Preble, 2004). It involves several essential elements (Minkler, 1992), namely; A product or service created and owned by the franchisor A license whereby third parties can supply the product or service to the purchasing public The need for franchisees to maintain the brand and all the standards for the product or service established by the franchisor The payment by the franchisor to the franchisee for the supply of the goods or service to the purchasing public in proportion to that which is on-sold to the public.  In a typical franchise, the product itself and all promotion of the product are undertaken by the franchisor, and the price for the product is totally controlled by the franchisor. The franchisee does not have responsibility for these vital aspects, and this significantly contrasts with other ways of conducting business.  In the case of normal commercial operations, each firm can set prices, product design etc. to their estimation of the market and each firm competes with the others within that market. Franchise regimes, on the other hand, provide some security to franchisees in the property rights associated with each franchise and for this protection and the existing business structure, franchisees are willing to accept and work within the controls of the franchisor.  In a sub-contracting arrangement, the sub-contracting firm has no responsibility for the performance of the product or service, it just supplies it and will be paid for the production of the item or service regardless of whether that is sold or not; the subcontractor has no responsibility to the contractor other than to provide the item or service as specified. A franchisee, on the other hand, is only paid for the achievement of the aims of the franchisor. If it cannot sell the service or product, it will not receive any recompense.  These are crucial distinctions as it puts responsibility onto the franchisee to achieve the aims of the franchisor in ways that are not part of a subcontractor’s normal considerations.  History of Monopoly Behavior A brief historical review shows that monopoly behaviour has been prevalent in many periods of history: monopolies have developed in many industries and through many periods of history.  It occurred with agricultural production and spice trades in ancient times (Frankopan, 2015), and memorably in the late 19 Century when the robber barons of the industrializing US economy seized the opportunity to dominate and control fast developing industries like steel, transport, newspapers, telegraph, etc. (Viscusi et al., 2005). The monopoly phenomenon seems able to emerge with nearly every change of technology or financial circumstance where early movers can gain advantages in a shifting economic and political landscape. Some would consider that emergent multinational giants of the tech era represent similar monopoly threats to society.  Frankopan notes that monopoly behaviour has always been a concern to both rulers and governments but for different reasons. Absolute rulers want to have control of certain activities to secure monopoly rents for the maintenance of their power. Nowadays, in democratic societies at least, governmental concern is more because the activities of sections of society that can gain monopoly rents have deleterious flow-on effects to the rest of the economy and society (Posner, 1978).  Size often confers efficiencies and competitive advantage and those companies that can become large and efficient often see off their commercial rivals and achieve dominance (Layton et al., 2011). Under the economic state of perfect competition, monopoly dominance means the monopolist gains the ability to raise prices, reduce quantity produced and exclude competitors through effective barriers to entry.  Some industries, because of their basic nature, are natural monopolies. Natural monopolies, potentially, will provide the cheapest production of goods and services and so, if they can be managed and controlled, there is some justification for their presence. Posner (1978) summarizes with the observation that:  “If the entire demand within a relevant market can be satisfied at the lowest cost by one firm rather than by two or more, the market is a natural monopoly, whatever the actual number of firms in it.” He goes on that in these cases, competition is not a viable regulatory mechanism for control as “it is either short-lived” or “it produces inefficient results”. The transport franchise Dolomiti SuperSki to be later considered in this paper, is in an industry that is sometimes considered to be a natural monopoly (Evans, 1991). This is in part because of the advantages conferred on passengers by common ticketing (a feature notable missing from say UK intercity trains) and integrated networks (White, 2013). But whether natural or not, it is the control of monopolies in a general sense that this paper is concerned with.   Control of Monopoly Behavior Many authors have examined the effective ways open to governments to ensure that no one participant in any industry can gain such a significant share of that market that it can engage in monopoly behaviour. Control of monopolies by the government is normally indicated in standard textbooks and research papers to be restricted to three general categories namely, having regulation of private firms, using the sub-contracting of tendered services, and using public enterprise (Viscusi et al., 2005, Hensher and Stanley, 2003).   In generally summary, Viscusi et al. (2005) record that the measures available to the government essentially boil down to three options, namely: having regulation of private firms,  using a subcontracting system of tendered services, and  the use of public enterprise  These three options are common to others commenting on the regulation of monopolies in public transport (Hensher et al., 2007), this last group looking at the structure of the contemporary public transport industry. One device currently used in transport, as well as the cable TV industry, is to allow a monopoly over a defined area, which is periodically tendered. In contrast, the device used in a Community Franchise is the ownership of individual lines by franchisees with full property rights, combined with competition, or the threat of competition being always present and with the ability of other franchisees to open lines in competition with existing ones.  Quality issues can also be problematic.  Spence (1975) argues that  “..market problems …. arise when a monopoly sets some aspect of product quality as well as price. It is argued that the market failure is associated with the inability of prices to convey information about the value attached to quality….” The most obvious need for regulation is to influence both the price and the quality of a product.  It is assumed that in a well-functioning market if those two elements are controlled then the quantity will adjust to suit demand. As well as the twin concerns of quality and price are the need for regulation to prevent concentrations of power in a single or a small number of commercial operators that can allow for abuses of oligopolistic and monopolistic positions. Lowering barriers to entry, by whatever means, is another and fundamental objective of monopoly control.   The three reported fundamental mechanisms for regulation of business monopoly are thus:   Avoidance of a concentration of power in a small group of companies, control of prices, and   the regulation of product with the specification of minimum standards  Any proper consideration of this topic must at least consider these three essential principles. If a government decides to not use a public enterprise, then control of monopoly involves both the prevention of exploitation and of ensuring that the monopolist operates at an efficient scale and at a lower price (Wolfstetter, 1996). Wolfstetter does not consider the use of a regulator acting as franchisor as a potential solution. However, that option was thought by several commentators to be a serious contender for inclusion by providing government control over monopoly activity while still allowing competition between different industry participants (Rubin, 1978, Williamson, 1976, Demsetz, 1968) and as noted was not an idea that has apparently been pursued.  So, how does franchising measure up on these issues? Franchising: Effects on Monopolies  The structure of the franchise regime gives it certain characteristics concerning the three considerations of monopoly control.    Exclusion of Competitors From the franchisor perspective, a benefit of the regime is the diversity of people and organizations that can contribute their knowledge, expertise and capital, to optimize brand effectiveness (Peterson and Dant, 1990). It is highly unlikely considering the benefits to the franchisor of a diversity of franchisees that a franchisor will end up with a monopoly within the ranks of its franchisees. In fact, the very opposite is more likely with a diversity of contributors being the natural inclination of the franchisor. This is an observable characteristic of franchising in any industry and an outcome that is not contradicted by the literature.  Control of Pricing  The very nature of the franchisor/franchisee relationship in traditional franchising, is to embed all authority over price with the franchisor. The operating franchisees running the individual businesses have no way of influencing the pricing to improve their own competitive position. This is certainly the case in terms of competition with other franchisees of the same brand: they are all selling the same product for the price regulated by the franchisor.  Maintenance of Quality  The franchisor defines the standards that franchisees must meet to continue to be able to continue as franchisees and be paid for their contribution. Franchisees can only sell the product that is being offered and promoted by the franchisor. Controls for standards vary as to the industry, but it is evident from the many examples of franchises currently in operation, that common standards can apply to all outlets of any particular brand, even if those outlets are owned and operated by separate individuals and businesses as franchisees in different administrative jurisdictions.  Community Franchise Regime  To illustrate the effect of the business regime on these issues of control, the case of a transport franchise as an example of a government owned business will now be described. This long-standing business that transports skiers in the ski fields of Italy was the subject of my doctoral thesis.  Dolomiti SuperSki has been in successful operation for over forty years. As a functioning example of this business regime, it not only shows how the regime operates over the longer term, but also shows the different alignments of interests compared to say centrally planned corporate ski field lifting systems and also, government provided public transport regimes. The ‘community’ in the name adopted by Dolomiti SuperSki is important, as it is government who must own and control the commercial franchisor for it to have this status. It operates differently to other franchises because of this ownership, and this will be discussed below.  Investigations over several years has established with reasonable certainty, that the Community Franchise regime is a unique operation for a public transport function that can now be analyzed for its effect on monopoly behavior.  This analysis will commence with ownership of the franchisor before moving to the allocation resources and the effects of these matters on the various interested parties.  Regime Operations The Community Franchise regime operating in the Dolomites works as follows. The (regional government) franchisor has responsibility for the marketing of the ski service, the encouragement of patronage by the public, the setting of operation times and standards and the collection and distribution of all income from fares. The franchisor does not undertake any transport function itself.  It sets fare levels, markets the product and collects the fares from passengers. It then distributes income to each private line operating franchisee, strictly in proportion to passenger numbers carried. The franchisor retains a percentage of the turnover to maintain its own operations and to ensure an appropriate financial margin for this activity.  In the Dolomites, independent private commercial franchisees propose, finance and then run all the separate lines of ski lifting devices, from chair lifts and gondolas to cable cars. Each separate lift, when it is accepted as a franchisee by Dolomiti SuperSki, is an independent business, although some franchisee operators own many lifts in several geographic areas. Each ski lift has electronic detection of an Opal/Oyster style ticket as a retained value charged card sold by the franchisor. It is carried by the skier and when detected at the ticket reading turnstile of the lift, that operator is paid, in real time, for each passenger who passes through. The franchisor uses its percentage of the retained fare turnover for its own administration, computer systems, profit, etc. and distributes the rest of fare income to franchisees.  This retained percentage is set at 3% of turnover; all other revenue goes to franchisees.  Initiation of a new line of transport does not rely on a central planning initiative like most public transport systems. Entrepreneurial, independent franchisees use their initiative to suggest, construct, improve and run in the most economic fashion, the lines of transport that the franchisee has decided are needed and would be financially viable. They do this knowing the standards relating to periods and times of operation, quality etc. Congestion is an indicator of demand and these private sector operators respond commercially to these indicators to personally benefit from an obvious need.  A noticeable effect of the independence of the franchisee lift owners is the large number of lifts and the continual improvement of the infrastructure, compared to integrated commercially controlled ski resorts. The Dolomiti ski fields are by far the largest by lift numbers (460), in the European market (next largest being Portes du Soleil in France 172) and by an order of magnitude compared to North American fields (largest is Vale at 45). This approach has also given the Dolomiti ski fields the largest number of lifts per length of ski runs in the world (Dolomiti lifts per kilometer of ski run: 0.335 lifts/kmrun c.f. rest of Europe 2.3 lifts/kmrun and North America 0.11 lifts/kmrun) (Emerson, 2020). It has done this whilst maintaining economical service delivery and providing productive employment of capital and labor in the local region that the franchise ownership represents.   The essential elements of monopoly control will now be examined to identify the essential differences in the way that the Community Franchise regime operates.  Pricing  Each franchisee, regardless of their size has security of tenure over their assets with the ability to operate without fear or threat of loss of those assets. If they operate within the parameters of the franchisor’s rules, only pricing by the franchisor determines if they will be able to continue their business.  The European ski market is large and competitive, including multiple fields in the alpine countries to which most of the population of the EU has easy access to and can choose between. The Dolomites is not considered an expensive ski destination but is listed in the best . The situation as to pricing establishes a responsibility on the franchisor to set fares and thus franchisee payments at levels that are enough to generate franchisee activity; without profitable franchisees, the franchisor will not have a viable presence in the market. It is also a safeguard against the abuse of pricing power and other commercial tactics by franchisees which could eliminate competitors and enable a franchisor to secure a more dominant position in the market.   The different effects of the regime on the allocation of resources was investigated in my thesis study by a computer game modelling public transport in an artificial city. This computer game was one that I devised specially for this study to investigate the different resource allocation models. This showed that social welfare was not significantly different in a regime where resources are allocated by a central authority, compared to one where all decisions on resource allocation are made by undirected competing individual franchisees and none are made by the central authority. This experiment also showed that competition between competing franchisees did not inhibit the evolution of a transport network that was in any way less efficient that one developed by a single authority by top down planning.  https://www.onthesnow.co.uk/news/a/582823/10-of-the-biggest-ski-areas-in-europeQuality Control  All ski lifting services in the Dolomites must operate over certain hours of the day and days of year, as determined by Dolomiti SuperSki. As well, the franchisees must adhere to standards of operation prescribed by government or other bodies with jurisdiction over these considerations, e.g. safety, engineering standards, etc. If an individual operating franchisee wishes to exceed these standards, e.g. by having greater comfort, longer operating times, enhanced visual appeal, better facilities at each end of their run, or whatever, it is entirely up to that individual franchisee. Provided the minimum standards are adhered to, payment for passengers will continue. If the franchisee can see commercial benefit in exceeding those standard expectations, e.g. by extending the period of the day in which it operates, or upgrading the facility to make it more attractive or quicker, it is possible for the franchisee to benefit from this application of their own initiative. This protects the service consumer by ensuring minimum standards but does not restrict, in fact positively encourages, any move for a better service. It allows differentiation of services by different providers who will benefit if their reading of the market for transport is accurate.  Barriers to Market Entry From the franchisor perspective, a benefit of the regime is the diversity of people and organizations that can contribute their knowledge, expertise and capital, to optimize brand effectiveness (Peterson and Dant, 1990). It is thus highly unlikely that a franchisor will be inclined to restrict the entry of the greatest range of franchisees that may result in there being insufficient independent entities to ensure competition. In fact, the very opposite is more likely; diversity of franchisees is an observable characteristic of franchising in any industry and an outcome that is not contradicted by the literature.  Franchisor Ownership  It is shown that franchising can provide control over the three essential aspects considered here as being required for monopoly control, i.e. quality, pricing and standards. However, the ownership of the franchisor itself can have a great influence over the way this power is exercised.  There are obvious differences between private and public owners, and this is illustrated by the case of Uber. The Uber phenomenon may not generally be referred to as a franchise, but it fits the definition in critical ways: the business model is such that the brand is that of the controlling company and it charges for the use of that brand by individual franchisees, which then commit their own capital to each franchise operation. The type of company structure utilized by Uber is considered to be a franchise by several commentators, (Giuli and Maselli, 2015, Schneider, 2015, Sundararajan, 2014). The franchisor, Uber, organizes the marketplace to bring provider and user together, and takes a percentage of the cash flow for doing this.   The basic function of Uber is essentially the same as in ski lifting in the Dolomites where Dolomiti SuperSki has created a marketplace to allow providers to freely choose the means of service provision and for passengers to freely choose to use any provider. In the process, both Uber and Dolomiti SuperSki handle all marketing, ticketing and the distribution of revenue to an agreed formula, retaining a set percentage of that turnover for its own administration and marketing function.  A principal difference in the Uber and Dolomit SuperSki regimes, apart from the fixed line nature of the ski lifting compared to the point to point flexibility of a taxi, is the ownership structure. Uber is a publicly listed joint stock company while Dolomiti SuperSki is a community owned private company. The difference in ownership and alignments of interest becomes apparent when the charges for franchisees are considered. Dolomiti SuperSki retains 3% of the gross cashflow for the maintenance of its function. This percentage of turnover contrasts with that of Uber which advises on the rideshare analysis company ‘Ridester’ website that it charges its independent drivers 25% of fare income. Ridester note that the actual percentage able to be retained by Uber can be higher, reportedly in the range of 27% to 50%, depending on circumstances. Uber is, of course, a very valuable listed company.  The case of Uber shows how a privately owned franchise can control crucial operations to benefit the commercial entity over both the passenger and the franchisee drivers, a feature identified by several researchers (Wilkins, 2016, Kosoff, 2014, Schneider, 2015).  On the other hand, a government entity is subject to the ultimate control of the legislature of the jurisdiction in which it operates. Although there are many examples of how slow these controls may be to take effect, the elected representatives of a controlling legislature tend to ultimately prevail. This was the case with say the East India Company, which was finally brought to heal by the British parliament after a century or so of deliberation (Dalrymple, 2019). Parliamentary scrutiny was more effectively applied in the case of Australia Post which was quite sensitive to the parliamentary scrutiny of its postal charges during the gradual decline of traditional postal services. This profit-making entity kept the loss-making traditional postal service going and sufficiently affordable to meet the parliament’s reading of the voting public’s attitude to what was popularly considered an essential service (Castro and Maddock, 1997).  It is an observable effect of local community ownership that the franchisor is very much more constrained in its ability to exploit the franchisees. This sensitivity to the legislature is in stark contrast to the behavior of Uber which has a long history of confrontation with governments in various parts of the world (Rauch and Schleicher, 2015).   Kemp (2015) notes how difficult it is to both define in legislation and to prosecute cases in courts over anticompetitive behavior. The business model of franchising invests all the power over pricing and quality in the franchisor. When this body is government owned, this authority over pricing is provided directly to a body that will use it with the oversight of elected representatives, a characteristic which tends to circumvent the difficulties of private corporate behavior.  Another consideration of ownership is the remote nature of company boards and shareholders. There is no necessary correlation between shareholder or the boards of company control and the areas that these companies may operate in. Accordingly, there is less incentive for a remote board to consider local community issues. Governments are essentially local to a specific geography in their operations, and a Community Franchise is responsive to the geographic area in ways that multi-national remote commercial entities are not. On consideration of these matters, it seems essential for the control of monopolies that the owner of the franchisor be by Government.  https://www.ridester.com/uber-fees/Resource Allocation and Monopolies An unexpected effect of franchising with implications for monopoly behavior emerged from my doctoral study. This was the techniques that the Italian regime has developed for the allocation of resources in the development of its transport network. In traditional integrated commercial firms, as it is for government and commercial enterprises generally, resources are allocated in a centralized manner by top down command. In the Dolomiti SuperSki case, all resources for the transport function are initiated and ultimately allocated by franchisees. Each entrepreneurial franchisee assesses both risks and the rewards for opportunities that it sees are open to it in new or improved services, before committing to and taking responsibility for asset allocation, funding and operations.  Network planning in this situation is a bottom up process, with the franchisor having no part in the process apart from the setting of the rates for the movement of a passenger over a standard distance. This mechanism, by either raising or lowering this amount, has been found sufficient for the franchisor to stimulate or suppress activity by franchisees. It has different rates for the carriage of passengers by different modes, e.g. by chair lift compared to say cable cars. By this means, it can encourage the interest of franchisees in investigating the viable development of different styles of transport.  The passengers are entirely oblivious of these differential payments, as the whole network is open to their use through their single ticket. This process has proven sufficient over the forty years of operation to have the world’s largest ski field by lift numbers develop into a network that is not noticeably different from one planned by the central owner of a ski field using the best planners available to them. It is planning that occurs without a central intelligent designer.  This bottom up process was shown in my thesis to be entirely consistent with appropriate definitions of design, so long as those definitions consider the three essential elements of design, namely generation of variation to an existing design, the evaluation of that variation by reference to a standard, and the selection of the alternative with the best fit to the criteria (Emerson, 2020).  In the Dolomites, the franchisor exerts control over the process, but variation is generated by franchisees, evaluation is by the travelling public and selection is by economic forces. This contrasts with the current operations of the government urban public transport enterprise in New South Wales’ where variation is generated by politicians and TfNSW, evaluation is by mathematical modelling and selection is by politicians advised by bureaucracy and expert consultants. These processes are in stark contrast to each other; the franchise is essentially market driven and the top down planning of the single owner is essentially centralized planning.   This manner of resource allocation eliminates in Community Franchising further potential conflict of interest in the centralized ownership of a monopoly; all substantive decisions of resources are made by those parties that are closest to and are most affected by the immediate financial effects of that allocation. In the Community Franchise regime, the executive function of the elected government is removed, along with all temptation to abuse the powers involved in resource allocation for party or personal electoral advantage. The essential function of the elected government in this situation is to reflect their constituent’s values by providing the necessary inducements to commercial franchisees to provide the services the government has responsibility for. The executive function in a Community Franchise is exercised by independent commercial entities, the franchisees, who respond to the rates on offer, but essentially are only interested in their own commercial judgement of the business opportunities, the rates on offer and the economic efficiency of the resource allocation. The level of inducement, i.e. the value placed on public transport in this case, becomes a politically contestable issue that is easily identified, debated and decided by electoral processes. The more difficult task of allocation and husbanding of resources is left to the commercial franchisee where more appropriate responsibility and risk management skills can be argued to reside.   Franchisees are well placed to shepherd resources in the most responsible ways: it is not up to a monopolist owner who may cross subsidize various costs or just maximize profits, or to politicians who may be swayed by political considerations.  This bottom up evolution is an effect that can be seen in many franchise regimes where the franchisor is open to the entrepreneurial talents of its franchisees. It contributes to the independent operation of regime participants free from the influence of a single monopolist.  Conclusions   Franchising as used in the Dolomites and, as proposed for an urban public transport application, provides effective control mechanisms to the franchisor over any market participant for prices and quality; franchising has this control built in.  The differences between government and private ownership demonstrate a vital factor in public interest. A government, if it owns the franchisor, can provide effective influence over the three important characteristics of monopoly concern, namely the inclusion of competing franchisees, the control of pricing and the upholding of quality standards. Ownership by government of commercial entities, from postal services (Australia Post) to railways (Australian Rail Track Corporation), are not uncommon. While there is no essential difference to these examples of government ownership of profit-oriented corporations and a profit-oriented franchise, there are differences in the behavior of those two contrasting commercial regimes.    A government owned franchising company, i.e. a Community Franchise, appears to have effective means of discharging its responsibilities to consumers and voters that these market constituents consider important. It would seem appropriate for the questions asked in the last century on the effect of franchising on monopoly control, to be restated and examined anew. It is quite conceivable that the franchise regime in government ownership can provide the control necessary to maintain public interests.  ISoF 2021 THE ‘REASONABLE PERSON’ IN STANDARD FORM FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS  Dr Jenny Buchan Emeritus Professor  UNSW Sydney Australia, 2052 +61 (0) 432 87 99 88 jm.buchan@unsw.edu.au Dr Courtenay Atwell Research Development Manager Business School UNSW Sydney Australia, 2052 +61 (2) 9385 1950 c.atwell@unsw.edu.auDr. Rob Nicholls Associate Professor of Business Law Business School UNSW Sydney Australia, 2052 T:  +61 2 9385 3251 | M:  +61 4 1264 6477 r.nicholls@unsw.edu.auISoF 2021 ABSTRACT Standard form agreements represent the vast majority of contracts entered into in any time period. Many of these are consumer contracts or small business contracts. Some are presented as \"click-through\" agreements. That is, the standards form agreement is often a short decision between an offer and the delivery of a service. Most franchise agreements are standard form agreements. The franchisee does not have the ability to amend the franchise agreement as a standard form agreement. Indeed, it is the uniformity of the arrangements between franchisors and franchisees that characterises business format franchising. There is an issue with standard form agreements in that they often contain tests which are more usually characteristic of negotiated agreements. One of these tests is that of \"reasonableness\". Typically, the test is configured as a decision that would be taken by someone acting reasonably in simian circumstances. This article provides an overview of standard form agreements and the statutory context that contains them. By analysing the concept of reasonableness in standard form agreements and the \"reasonable person\" test, the article considers the Australian judicial interpretation of reasonableness in business format franchising. It concludes that it is unsatisfactory for franchisees to have to determine what amounts to reasonable conduct retrospectively and only after an issue or dispute arises. NTRODUCTION Contracts, made by reasonable people, are central to commerce. As David Slawson observed, as long ago as 1971, standard form agreements (SFA) comprised 99 per cent of all contracts. There is no reason to expect this weighting of negotiated contracts compared to SFAs has changed. Today, SFAs are ubiquitous, and non-negotiable. There is no getting around the fact that even significant events like committing to renting retail premises or a 10-year term as a franchisee are documented through standard form agreements. On any given day in 2021, an individual will use their mobile phone, swipe their pre-paid Opal, MyKi or Oyster card as they board public transport to get to work. They might download an app onto their phone via a clickwrap contract and be presented with a Boxtop after making an online purchase. They will be presented with targeted advertising while browsing online that has been made possible through real time bidding and browse wrap. The day may end by watching a TV series on ABC iView or Netflix, or going on a date organised through an app. Each of these activities, and countless others, are only possible for users who  Slawson, W. D. (1971). Standard form contracts and democratic control of lawmaking power. Harvard Law Review, 529-566. ISoF 2021 have agreed to the terms of SFAs with their transport provider, café, financial institution, employer, internet service provider or other supplier. SFAs are pervasive, inescapable and seldom read or fully understood as we rush through life. They also document relationships between franchisors and franchisees.  A fundamental tenet to be applied when interpreting contracts, including SFAs, is that they record agreements between reasonable people. The task of defining the reasonable person has been an important undertaking in the progression of modern contract law. We are told that ‘The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over apprehension and fromoverconfidence’.The reasonable person, also known as the man on the Clapham Omnibus,the ordinary prudent man of business, the officious bystander, and the reasonable jurorcameos more than 9,000 times in Australian statutes. That reasonable person is also both the franchisor who drafts the standard form franchise agreement, and the franchisee who is bound by its terms. In this article we try to understand, in the context of franchisors and franchisees: ‘Who are you Reasonable Person? I would very much like to meet you as we are so much alike - behaving the same …’This article will proceed as follows. First, an overview of standard form agreements is provided. Second, we identify the restraints designed to prevent the drafter of contractual agreements that meet the statutory tests from giving full reign to their own interests. Third, a discussion of the concept of reasonableness in standard form agreements is undertaken, with a specific focus on contextual reasonableness, perspectives of reasonableness, business common sense and the difference between reasonable and rational behaviour. We then examine varying definitions of the reasonable person that have emerged in particular legal contexts, with a focus on the Australian judicial interpretation of reasonableness in business format franchising before concluding.

ISoF 2021 STANDARDFORMAGREEMENTSSFAs offer a range of commercial benefits to parties, including franchisors in their role as drafters. Benefits include a reduction in drafting time and costs otherwise incurred in preparation of bespoke negotiated agreements. In situations like franchising they offer learning benefits whereby familiar terms are easier and quicker to work with for the franchisor-seller, the franchisor’s internal administrative team and their legal counsel. This leads to a reduction in institutional costs in processing each contract and decreased contractual complexity. The relative ease of replicating SFAs with minimal adaptation [for new parties] has also contributed to their success, and to them being criticised by Judges.We will return to the judicial criticism in Part VI.In addition to the drafter/supplier-driven appeal of SFAs, their widespread acceptance can be attributed to other economic and behavioural factors attributed to consumers. These include legal illiteracy, cognitive biases that include boundedly rational consumer behaviour, the high cost of legal advice, and the cost-benefit analysis consumers may undertake when weighing up the time it would take to become informed against the value of what they are buying.  But, countering all the benefits of SFAs, two of the central tenets of common law contract theory, the notion of ‘agreement’ and the concept of what it means to be ‘reasonable’, can be challenged. In 1939, American legal realist Karl Llewellyn suggested that: where bargaining is absent in fact, the conditions and clauses to be read into a bargain are not those which happen to be printed on the unread paper but are those which a sane man might reasonably expect to find on that paper.Around the same time, German-born American legal scholar Fredrich Kessler advocated that courts ought to take into account what they determine to be a consumer’s reasonable expectation in a business-to-consumer contract dispute, and to use the ‘typical life situation’ as a yardstick.One scholar goes as far as suggesting that because consumers of SFAs are unable to negotiate the terms of their agreement, no meaningful consent can be See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12.   Llewellyn, K. (1939) The standardization of commercial contracts in English and continental law, 52 Harvard Law Review, 700, 704.  Kessler, F. (1943). Contracts of Adhesion--Some Thoughts About Freedom of Contract. Columbia Law Review, 43(5), 629-642. ISoF 2021 asserted and therefore, the contract cannot be enforced. For American Larry DiMatteo, the absence of the intention to form a binding contractual relationship, writing:  A rational application of the reasonable person standard would recognize the flaw in this notion of consent. … at least one of the parties did not read or understand the fine print of the pre-printed form. There is no true manifestation of intent because there has been no conscious agreement to accept the unread terms.In recognition of this absence of meaningful consent, David Horton notes that ‘whether special rules should govern standard-form contracts has long been one of the most controversial issues in private law’. We will see in Part III that Australia has made moves in this direction, recognising that both domestic and business consumers should be given some protection from unnecessarily onus terms of SFAs. Malaysian academics Mohd Faiz Abdullah and Rozanah Ab Rahman go further than DiMatteo and oppose the labelling of SFAs as contracts.Instead, they suggest that SFAs are ultimatums, … with one party dictating the terms … on a take it or leave it basis. To Margaret Radin, ‘… contract law has slowly been stretched and manipulated to apply to a set of phenomena that are dubbed ‘contracts’, but no longer meet the bare-bones criteria’. The objective theory of contract assumes that there has been a meeting of the minds and that the parties have agreed to the terms and conditions set out in their agreement. Clearly not all scholars agree that this is what happens in SFAs. As traditional contact law does not address the characteristics of standard form contracting, such as the need for a meeting of the minds, how do we apply the established concept of the reasonable man in a world of one-sided contracts of adhesion and mass deployed boilerplate clauses? As Radin contends:  Under current cultural understandings, we cannot construe the ‘reasonable person’ in the position of the recipient of boilerplate in the way we formerly were able to construe the ‘reasonable person’ in the position of someone who intended to accept an offer DiMatteo, L.

ISoF 2021 Traditional theories of contract are arguably being contorted when attempts are made to apply legal rules that assess their valid formation to SFAs.  An aspect of reasonableness in SFAs that has not been addressed in detail in the academic literature is the act of a consumer choosing to remain uninformed, and whether this is reasonable or unreasonable behaviour. It is recognised that consumers are boundedly rational given that they do not consider many attributes of their purchase, choosing instead to focus on the salient attributes such as price, availability and physical characteristics. This enables sellers to supply low quality non-salient attributes. However, buyers also know it is not worth their time to become fully informed. Is it logical to expect a consumer to read a 25-page terms of use document before using their Opal Card? Or digesting the 5,000 words Google takes to explain its terms of service and privacy policy? The answer is ‘no’. Franchisees, as business consumers, may also be criticised for not reading every word of their franchise agreements. We identify some of the reasons for this in Part V. As pressing as the issue of whether the parties have agreed to the terms of the SFA is the fact that contract law operates on the dual assumptions that a reasonable person entered the contract and that they can be characterised objectively. All parties are impliedly reasonable people. But, what does that mean in practice? As Olivier Corten identifies:Any attempt to understand the use of the notion of reasonable in international legal discourse starts with recognition of a profound ambiguity, which is reflected in this quotation from a decision of the International Court of Justice: ‘what is reasonable and equitable in any given case must depend on its circumstances.’ The pervasiveness of the reasonable person construct is captured by Fletcher, who suggests that ‘[w]e cannot even begin to argue about most issues of responsibility and liability without first asking what a hypothetical reasonable person would do under the circumstances.’However, reasonable peoples’ circumstances vary greatly. By 2016, over 300 languages were spoken in Australian homes. One would have to assume that each demographic group would make different assumptions as to what and who is reasonable. Notions of ‘reasonable’ would be influenced by factors such as education level, where someone  Korobkin, R. (2003). Bounded rationality, standard form contracts, and unconscionability.

ISoF 2021 lived, their age, their mental state, and where they obtained information from. The expectations and identity of the reasonable person in multicultural markets can no longer be taken for granted as objectively knowable.That reasonable people are parties to SFAs is fundamental to the interpretation of contract terms. As Italian legal philosopher Silvia Zorzetto suggests, it would be reductive to consider the notion of reasonable as a concept that is simply an implicit component of statutory law. Reasonableness is a legal standard, a general principle and a word in a clause all at the same time. Zorzetto suggests that the concept is an inner feature of law and a criterion of legal validity for all laws. For criminal law American academic George P Fletcher, ‘[o]ne of the most striking particularities of our discourse is its pervasive reliance on the term reasonable’.British legal scholar Albert Kiralfy, an expert on Soviet and Russian law, argued that the authority of law ultimately rested on its reasonableness and not on its authorship.In an 86-page Australian franchise agreement ‘reasonabl*’ occurs 30 times, 90 times in the 303-page disclosure document provided by another franchisor. Those who draft and issue franchise agreements and franchisees signing these contracts have different interests. Radin notes that in the context of ‘less sophisticated parties [such as many franchisees], … [the text of SFAs] is often directed at deleting legal rights and remedies’. The integration of SFAs into all forms of consumer transactions facilitates the inclusion of one-sided or non-reciprocal rights. Let us now look at the steps that Australia’s legislature has taken to curb excessive opportunism by suppliers drafting SFAs. Some franchise agreements are captured while others exceed the current statutory thresholds. TATUTORY ESTRAINTS ON USTRALIAN A legal challenge may be made ex post where the terms are applied by the drafter in a blatantly unconscionable way, or where unfair contract terms are challenged by regulators. But, contracts may disincentivise legal challenges by, for example, expressly forbidding class actions, or through governing law and dispute clauses in franchise agreements which state Zorzetto, S.

For example, in My Amazing Athletes 2017 franchise agreement in the USA, Clause 16.7 “We each understand and specifically agree that any matters concerning the relationship between us and any dispute arising as a result, will be ISoF 2021 that, regardless of where in the world they arise, disputes may only, ultimately, be resolved in the courts of Connecticut. The absence of negotiation and meaningful consent has led to significant distortion in how contract theory is applied in practice. Therefore, the asymmetrical nature of terms in SFAs that favour franchisors is unsurprising.   The primary statutory instruments that can be called on to curtail over-reaching by parties drafting franchise agreements in Australia are the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which is Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (CCA), and the Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 2014 (the Code). Generic responses are found in the unconscionability (ss 20 – 22A) and unfair contract terms (ss 23 – 27) provisions of the ACL. These unfair contract terms provisions only apply to SFAs. Where contracts relate to financial products or services, Division 2, Subdivisions BA and C of the Australian Securities and Investments Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act) address, some unfair contract terms and unconscionable conduct. Unfair terms of small business contracts Section 23 of the ACL was amended in 2016 to extend to unfair contract terms (UCT) in small business contracts. This meant that franchise agreements that met all thresholds could ask a court to declare a term to be void. Prior to the amendment the ACCC conducted a review to gain a sense of the prevalence of UCT in contracts with small business. It included franchising, and found the following: The franchising sector was selected for the review due to the prevalence of standard form contracts in the sector, together with the fact that the franchising relationship is characterised by an inherent imbalance of power between franchisors and franchisees.  The ACCC requested that seven franchisors participate in the review. Three, including two major car brands, elected not to participate fully.  A variety of potentially unfair terms were raised with each of the traders, including the right to unilaterally vary operations manuals, unreasonable liquidated damages clauses, and terms that give the franchisor the right to terminate the agreement if the franchisee or manager is incapacitated.The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services 2018 identified UCT legislation as falling short for franchisees in several ways. It made determined on an individual basis and shall not be brought as a class action, or with multiple unrelated franchisees (whether as a result of attempted consolidation, joinder, or otherwise). This is prudent from a business standpoint because: (i) the mediation and arbitration procedures function most effectively on an individual case basis: (ii) there are significant factors present in each individual Franchisee’s situation which should be respected; and (iii) class-wide or multiple plaintiff disputes do not foster quick, amicable, and economic dispute resolutions.”  Timic v Hammock [2001] FCA 74 Subway Franchise Agreement, Australia, Clause 10 (f) Timic and Subway Systems agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in Connecticut any litigation or arbitration pursuant to the agreement (except intellectual property litigation or arbitration brought by Subway Systems against Timic).   https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/1117_Small%20Business%20Factsheet_FA4.pdf  ACCC, ‘Unfair terms in small business contracts: A review of selected industries’, November 2016, 17 ISoF 2021 recommendations about the application of UCT protections to the franchising sector in its report Fairness in Franchising. It recommended: prohibiting UCTs in all franchise agreements (recommendation 9.1 and 9.5);  applying civil pecuniary penalties and infringement notices where a standard form contract to a small business contains a UCT (recommendation 9.1);  resourcing the ACCC to investigate UCT reports by franchisees (recommendation 9.3); and  addressing the existence of UCTs in perpetual franchise agreements (recommendation 9.6). The unfair contract terms provisions were re-examined in 2018 and 2019. In its submission to Treasury in relation to UCT the ACCC expressed its frustration that despite significant efforts on its part it was impossible to force businesses using SFAs to delete UCTs unless the matter was taken to court. The ACCC identified that the protection offered to small businesses by the UCT provisions is undermined by fundamental limitations with the current regime, namely:  The current UCT provisions place a significant burden on the ACCC, or a party subject to a UCT, to enforce the provisions, while providing little to no incentive for businesses to proactively assess their standard form contracts for fairness. This is poor regulatory design, as it necessitates enforcement to achieve compliance with the law.As a result, compliance and enforcement action by regulators has minimal deterrence.Following extensive consultation Treasury announced in November 2020 that the notion of unfair contract terms would be expanded to enable consumers and small businesses to commit to contracts more confidently. The main reforms would do the following, but failed to address the ACCC’s frustration about its limited deterrence ability: Mak[e] unfair contract terms unlawful and giv[e] courts the power to impose a civil penalty Increase[e] eligibility for the protections by expanding the definition of small business and removing the requirement for a contract to be below a certain threshold Improv[e] clarity on when the protections apply, including on what is a ‘standard form contract.However, Section 23 ACL still contains thresholds, and the ACCC is still not empowered to impose penalties on parties that include UCT in contracts. The ACL currently states that:   (1)  A term of a consumer contract or small business contract is void if:                      (a)  the term is unfair; and                       (b)  the contract is a standard form contract.    (2)  The contract continues to bind the parties if it is capable of operating without the unfair term.    (4)  A contract is a small business contract if:  Review of Unfair Contract Term Protections for Small Business, ACCC Submission, 21 December 2018, 7.

Section 24 defines unfair              (1)  A term of a consumer contract or small business contract is unfair if:                       (a)  it would cause a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract; and                       (b)  it is not reasonably necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the term; and                       (c)  it would cause detriment (whether financial or otherwise) to a party if it were to be applied or relied on.               (2)  In determining whether a term of a contract is unfair under subsection (1), a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:                       (a)  the extent to which the term is transparent;                       (b)  the contract as a whole.               (3)  A term is transparent if the term is:                       (a)  expressed in reasonably plain language; and                       (b)  legible; and                       (c)  presented clearly; and                       (d)  readily available to any party affected by the term.               (4)  For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), a term of a contract is presumed not to be reasonably necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the party who would be advantaged by the term, unless that party proves otherwise.  25   Examples of unfair terms         Without limiting section 24, the following are examples of the kinds of terms of a consumer contract or small business contract that may be unfair:                       (a)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to avoid or limit performance of the contract;                       (b)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to terminate the contract;                       (c)  a term that penalises, or has the effect of penalising, one party (but not another party) for a breach or termination of the contract;                       (d)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to vary the terms of the contract;                       (e)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party (but not another party) to renew or not renew the contract;                        (f)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party to vary the upfront price payable under the contract without the right of another party to terminate the contract;                       (g)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party unilaterally to vary the characteristics of the goods or services to be supplied, or the interest in land to be sold or granted, under the contract;                       (h)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party unilaterally to determine whether the contract has been breached or to interpret its meaning;                        (i)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, one party's vicarious liability for its agents;  ISoF 2021                       (j)  a term that permits, or has the effect of permitting, one party to assign the contract to the detriment of another party without that other party's consent;                       (k)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, one party's right to sue another party;                        (l)  a term that limits, or has the effect of limiting, the evidence one party can adduce in proceedings relating to the contract;                      (m)  a term that imposes, or has the effect of imposing, the evidential burden on one party in proceedings relating to the contract;                       (n)  a term of a kind, or a term that has an effect of a kind, prescribed by the regulations.  27   Standard form contracts (1)  If a party to a proceeding alleges that a contract is a standard form contract, it is presumed to be a standard form contract unless another party to the proceeding proves otherwise.   (2)  In determining whether a contract is a standard form contract, a court may take into account such matters as it thinks relevant, but must take into account the following:                       (a)  whether one of the parties has all or most of the bargaining power relating to the transaction;                       (b)  whether the contract was prepared by one party before any discussion relating to the transaction occurred between the parties;                       (c)  whether another party was, in effect, required either to accept or reject the terms of the contract (other than the terms referred to in section 26(1)) in the form in which they were presented;                       (d)  whether another party was given an effective opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract that were not the terms referred to in section 26(1);                       (e)  whether the terms of the contract (other than the terms referred to in section 26(1)) take into account the specific characteristics of another party or the particular transaction;                        (f)  any other matter prescribed by the regulations.  There is little evidence of the ACCC taking action against franchisors for UCT in their franchise agreements. One of the few examples is Back In Motion Physiotherapy which has a franchise network of 500 physiotherapists. Its standard form franchise agreement included an overly onerous restraint of trade clause. The matter was settled when: The ACCC … accepted a court-enforceable undertaking by Back In Motion Physiotherapy Pty Ltd to remove certain terms from its franchisees agreements which it admits may be unfair.However, there is a strong likelihood that unfair contract terms will be prohibited to a greater extent by legislation during the course of 2021. On 6 November 2020, Commonwealth and state and territory consumer affairs ministers agreed to strengthen the existing unfair contract term protections in the ACL. These reforms are also expected to remove the small business contract size threshold discussed above.

ISoF 2021 changes was issued for discussion in December 2020 with submissions closing in March 2021.Franchising Code of Conduct Compliance with the Code has been mandatory for franchisors since 1998. In it, parties are directed to a standard of ‘reasonable’ 14 times. For example, Clause 10 of the Coderequires that a franchisor not enter into a franchise agreement unless they have received written statements from the franchisee or prospective franchisee that they have received, read and had a reasonable opportunity to understand the disclosure document and the code, and have been given advice from an independent legal adviser, independent business adviser or an independent accountant.  The protective purpose of this requirement is obvious, yet it was not observed by Ultra Tune in relation to Mr Ahmed prior to accepting what Ultra Tune would for a time contend to be a non-refundable payment.Mr Ahmed’s evidence was that he felt intimidated by what Mr Tatsis told him during this discussion and the manner in which he spoke to him. Mr Ahmed said that Mr Tatsis sounded angry and condescending. Mr Ahmed described feeling very pressured. I have no doubt that he was accurately describing his state of mind at that time, and that it was reasonable for him to possess such a state of mind in all the circumstances.Other examples, in the Code can be found in Clause 15(3) to reasonable marketing fund administration costs, Clause 17 to a reasonable amount of time, Clause 25 to reasonable consent, Clause 26 to reasonable expenses and Clause 27 and 28 to reasonable notice. All impossible to calibrate objectivelyHE MEANING OF EASONABLE IN TANDARD FORM GREEMENTSRecognition that rigidity in legal rules makes it difficult for laws to be applied to evolving, and diverse situations has led to the inclusion of agile expressions, including reasonable Reasonableness is a subjective construct that sits alongside the other contractual standards of best endeavours, duty of care, due diligence, fairness, and good faith. ‘Reasonableness’ as a concept has been described by Australia’s former Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason as providing ‘a flexible but objective standard by which to fashion legal rules  Ibid.  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd - [2019] FCA 12, para 53. Ibid Para 216. Corten, O. (1999). The notion of ‘reasonable’ in international law: legal discourse, reason and contradictions. International & Comparative Law Quarterly, 48(3), 613-625. ISoF 2021 capable of application in a multitude of contexts’. In relation to contract law, ‘Mason also said that ‘at least in a commercial environment, community morality may well demand that expectations reasonably held should be protected’. The widespread use of reasonable, according to Belgian legal academic, Olivier Corten, is attributable to its diverse application:The notion of reasonable is also used at every stage of judicial reasoning: the determination of facts, qualification and interpretation of applicable rules, the use of various rhetorical and logical formulas. … the judge is called upon to play a significant role. In the Australian Law Reports alone there are 48 different references to ‘reason*’. It is used as an adverb and adjective, in phrases that include reasonable belief, reasonable endeavours, reasonably suspected, reasonable mistake, reasonable grounds, reasonable person and reasonable precautions. Deciding what or who was reasonable is necessary in many areas of the law; from tort, to contract , crime, discrimination, and more. Reasonable is a concept that can depend on context for some of its meaning. For example, usually in tort cases the concept of the reasonable person is understood as a sort of average – the reasonable person has average capacities and resources to take care. In a few cases the law endows the reasonable person with the resources and capacities of the defendant even if these were not average.The tort analysis does not hold true in contract. The dictionary describes a reasonable person as ‘a legal fiction, a personification of the unexceptionable and ordinary’. Reasonable has also been examined in the context of administrative law in relation to decisions made by owners of units in a body corporate. In Re Body Corporate for Viridian; Kjerulf Ainsworth & Ors v Martin Albrecht & Anor, Member Rooney QC concluded that:  [d]ifferent contexts for different notions of reasonableness arise, particularly those that reference whether for example a policy or decision is a reasonable one or whether there was a reasonable basis for particular conduct by a person. Similarly, where cases where there is a commercial interest held by a party but in whom there is a duty to act reasonably in the exercise of some discretion, such as whether to approve a transfer of an interest to some other party.    Clearly, identifying reasonable is not as simple as locating a single dictionary, judicial or statutory definition. According to Italian legal philosopher Silvia Zorzetto:   Geoffrey Davies, ‘Reasonableness’ in In The Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia. (Oxford University Press, 2007).  Davies (n 44).

ISoF 2021 [R]easonable entails offering practical justification; in other words, reasonableness serves to justify human actions, choices, decisions, etc. From this point of view, it is a normative concept related to the practice of reasoning.An understanding of the nature of SFAs, with a focus on the complexity of fine print and the inclusion of pro drafting-party clauses, disclaimers, limitations on warranties, dispute resolution clauses, and other one-sided terms, will aid in defining today’s version of reasonableness. So, also, will an understanding of how the parties envisage the attributes of a reasonable person accepting a SFA. In Florencia Marotta-Wurgler’s study of SFAs, the average SFA in 2010 was drafted with increasingly more pro-seller terms and [was] several hundred words longer than its 2003 version. The increase in length was not caused by simplification and increased readability. Readability has remained constant, according to Marotta-Wurgler, with the average contract being as readable as a scientific journal article.The 2017 Australian Census identified that 66 percent of people aged 20 to 64 years have attained at least one non-school qualification. Of them, 62 percent have obtained a Certificate III trade qualification or higher and 31 percent have earned a university Bachelor degree qualification or higher. A similar proportion of males and females have obtained a Certificate III or higher (62 percent and 61 percent, respectively), while a greater proportion of females (35 percent) than males (28 percent) have attained a Bachelor degree or higher.It can thus be concluded that only a small proportion of the population, those who have completed a Bachelor’s degree, would be able to read the contents of a SFA, let alone understand it. Maybe this does not matter in the case of domestic consumer contracts where the consumer has recourse for defective products or services through statutory protections and Small Claims Tribunals. Horton asserts, simply thatbecause standard-form contracts are non-negotiable and consist of a maze of inscrutable fine print, a reasonable consumer would probably not spend time trying to decipher their terms’.Irrespective of whether SFAs ought to be considered contracts; the challenges of identifying the reasonable person have expanded with their pervasive use.

Flipping the Script: Contra Proferentem and Standard Form Contracts. U. Colo. L. Rev., 80, 431. ISoF 2021 wrote that ‘[t]he standardisation of contracts has removed the narrow focus of the reasonable person from the four corners of the contract’. To Marotta-Wurgler, boilerplate terms, as are seen in all contracts including SFAs, are modular and accretive. Legal jargon can be integrated into the fine print thereby making contracts harder to understand. Consumers may be told that specific terms, such as how to return a product for a refund, are on a website. This makes them inaccessible for people without reliable internet connections or a workable command of English. There are many other problems. As American legal academic Mark Patterson outlines:  [S]tandardization among firms also eliminates competition on the standardized terms, adding market power to bargaining power and making it even less likely that the needs of all parties will be served. When sellers agree on contract terms, they eliminate competition among themselves on those terms. Whether this elimination of competition leaves contracting parties worse off depends at least in part upon whether the standardized terms are important ones and upon whether sellers continue to compete on other, arguably more important terms like price.Kessler claims that SFAs ‘have become one of the many devices to build up and strengthen industrial empires’. If they were read, they would not necessarily be understood.The typical recipients of SFAs, according to Radin are not sophisticated parties. They lack understanding, power and control. In the context of franchise agreements, franchisees might be fluent in one field, like Angelo who is introduced in Part V, but neither they nor their suburban lawyer or accountant might be fluent in reading between the lines of a franchise agreement or a disclosure document. According to Marotta-Wurgler, the terms and conditions in SFAs remain unchanged because they are rarely invoked and are typically used for low-cost items that are unlikely to become the source of a litigation. But that justification that the goods being sold are low cost does not apply to SFAs that are used to purchase business format franchises. Marotta-Wurgler  Prosser, W. L. (1941).

These terms concerned the ability for the seller to collect users’ information and provisions enabling the seller to increase their control over the users of the good or service.Contract law cases considering the reasonable person have often concerned negotiated rather than standard form contracts. The concept of reasonable now seems to have two meanings in the context of contract law – having a ‘rational’ basis or being ‘appropriate’ in the circumstances. Both appear in cases where a ‘reasonable person’ is involved in the test for reasonableness but rationality does not always involve a ‘reasonable person’ test. We will now note the perspectives of circumstantial reasonableness, the perspective of reasonableness, business common sense and reasonableness as it relates to rationality before moving to look at the ‘reasonable person’ in the franchise context. Contextual reasonableness Larry DiMatteo suggests that the primary determinants of reasonableness are the circumstances surrounding the creation of the contract. Traditional judicial reasoning is not a scientific process, it is necessarily subjective. For Spanish European law researcher, Asier Garrido-Munoz, this is a justification for why certain factors, including principles, objectives and values, ought to be valued and given more weight than others. Medieval history professor Rebecca Colman adds: Since reason, like morals, can only be defined in relative terms, any judgment must be directed at the functional relationship between certain legal procedures and their particular social context.Other scholars have alluded to the vagueness of the term. Corten suggests that the concept excludes fixed, static and definitive interpretations. And Zorzetto acknowledges that ‘[w]hat is reasonable is not only determined by culture but is also deeply influenced by its  Marotta-Wurgler, F. (2012). Does Contract Disclosure Matter? Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics JITE, 168(1), 94-119  See, for example, Jeannie Paterson, Andrew Robertson and Arlen Duke, Principles of Contract Law (Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Pty Limited, 2015), Chapters 3 and 5.

ISoF 2021 philosophical and political background.’ The inference is that reasonableness cannot be defined in the way that many other principles of objective contract law theory can be. It is therefore unsurprising that reasonableness has been criticised for increasing uncertainty in contractual relations. As Stefano Bertea outlines:   It is in fact quite common to see a trade-off between justice as reasonable fairness and as legal certainty. … certainty and reasonableness are colliding ideals or principles: 'to achieve a great degree of certainty within a legal system is to relinquish some of its reasonableness; conversely, a gain in reasonableness carries a loss in certainty'Further, it is often the case that what was reasonable at a point in time, is no longer reasonable at another.  In summary, reasonableness is distilled from the common-sense values of Judges, and thus from the values of the broader society at any given time. This is confirmed in the Australian case law that has addressed reasonableness in the context of negotiated contracts. Wegan Constructions v Wodonga the determination of reasonableness in the context of a ‘reasonable amount’ and the ‘reasonableness of a variation’ to a contract were central. The test of reasonableness was identified as ‘that of an objective assessment by an independent by-stander’, with Lush J stating that ‘[r]easonableness is not an abstract quality but one which is to be judged against the background of surrounding circumstances.We now touch on the distinction between ‘best’ and ‘reasonable’. ‘Reasonable endeavours’ cannot be construed to be an absolute or unconditional obligation, rather they are conditional on what is reasonable at the particular time, in the particular circumstances. Process Minerals v Consolidated Minerals addressed the distinction between ‘best endeavours’ and ‘reasonable endeavours’. There, Martin J stated that distinctions between ‘best endeavours’ and ‘reasonable endeavours’ raise ‘something of an arid terminology distinction’, further adding that ‘best endeavours’ is ‘hardly absolute in character’ and raises ‘reasonableness considerations about on the ground, day to day facts, which can only be assessed by reference to relevant circumstances as they subsist from time to time’.

ISoF 2021 Four years later, the determination of ‘reasonable endeavours’ was at the centre of another contractual dispute. In Woodside the High Court of Australia provided guidance on the interpretation of terms in a ‘commercial contract’, stating the they are to be determined by what ‘a reasonable businessperson would have understood those terms to mean’. Their Honours referred to CPC Group Ltd v Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company when acknowledging thatcontracts containing an obligation to use ‘reasonable endeavours to achieve a contractual object contain their own internal standard of what is reasonable, by some express reference relevant to the business interests of an obligee’. In this case, the ‘reasonable endeavours’ clause was held to mean that the sellers are not required to forego or sacrifice their own business interests when satisfying the standard. While neither of the contracts in WoodsideCPC Group was a SFA, the courts’ guidance suggests how they might decipher the qualities of the reasonable person. Reasonable from whose perspective?  Is the reasonable contract drafter thinking of ‘others’ or only the reasonable, or unreasonable, client? What is reasonable depends on which side of transaction one is located. As outlined by Blackburn J in Smith v Hughes ‘it is the view of a reasonable man in the position of the promisee which is crucial’ in establishing an estoppel. It has historically been argued that the reasonable man is possessed with the characteristics and abilities that enable him or her to evaluate, from a point of detached objectivity and from neither the position of the promisor or promisee. However, the vantage point proposed by John Spencer might be more accurate:  the reasonable eavesdropper is notionally at the keyhole, enthusiastically drawing inferences from what he hears within. But what if one of the parties is at Land’s End and the other at Llandudno? At whose keyhole is the reasonable eavesdropper notionally listening then. ... The difficulty is that the inference he will draw will depend on how much he knows, and what he will know will often depend on where he isThe question of what makes a provision in a SFA reasonable or unreasonable is difficult, if not impossible, to answer in a standard-setting way. There are many things to consider in any such attempt, including the perspective of reasonableness and how it differs for the drafting versus the non-drafting party.

In the context of consumer agreements, the standard of the reasonable person is generally considered from the perspective of the consumer. In Australian cases concerning negotiated contracts, we have seen the standard of reasonableness judged from the perspective of the drafter, the non-drafter and, most popularly, an objective third party.Gerard McMeel and Hans Christoph Grigoleit discuss objectivity in contract interpretation, offering alternative perspectives; promisee objectivity and detached objectivity:  ‘Promisee objectivity’ construes the language of the promisor from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the promisee. ‘Detached objectivity’ or ‘fly on the wall objectivity’ adopts the perspective of a reasonable bystander [such as the test in Hospital Products v US Surgical Corp (1984) 156 CLR 41], or eavesdropper on the parties. Whilst there are authorities supporting both formulations, it appears that the tenor of the most recent authorities is for ‘detached objectivity’ or ‘fly on the wall objectivity.Peters Ice Cream v Todd a restraint of trade clause was held by Little J to be valid only if it was reasonable in the interests of the parties, while at the same time ‘in no way injurious to the public’. In this case, the perspective was that of the drafting party. The reasonableness of the restraint was also to be determined at the date the contract was made. In this case, there was no standard against which reasonableness could be measured and, therefore, the court held that the restraint of trade clause was void for uncertainty. The drafter had not defined the scope of the restraint. In some cases, what is reasonable from the consumer’s perspective prevails. InTransfield v Arlo it was acknowledged that ‘best endeavours’ connotes ‘the standard of reasonableness’. The outcome of this case, where Transfield, as licensee, was defending an allegation that it had breached the competition law, was determined from the perspective of the non-drafting party. In presenting his judgment, Mason J focused on reasonableness considering the surrounding circumstances, as measured with regard to ‘the nature, capacity, qualifications  See for example Peters Ice Cream (Vic) v Todd [1961] VR 485  See for example Transfield Pty Ltd v Arlo International Ltd (1980) 144 CLR  See for example Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64; Morpath Pty Ltd v ACT Youth Accommodation Group Inc [1987] FCR 325; Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1969) 119 CLR 365  McMeel, G., & Grigoleit, H.

ISoF 2021 and responsibilities of the licensee viewed in light of the particular contract’. Adding that ‘best endeavours’ was ‘to do all that could reasonably be expected of it having regard to the circumstances of its business operations’. The US Restatement (Second) of Contracts (‘Second Restatement’, ‘The Restatement Test’) provides an interesting, yet controversial, approach. While there are criticisms of the Restatement Test, the trend for courts in determining procedural unconscionability has been to consider a reasonable buyers surprise with the content of the term. The Restatement Test essentially relies on the reasoning that the more unfavourable a term is in an SFA, the more likely it is that the [weaker/ consumer] signatory did not agree to it or understand it. Russell Korobkin observes that in doing so:  [C]ourts seem to have attempted to split the difference between the moral hazard problem (which would arise if buyers’ ignorance were permitted to work to their advantage) and the lemons problem (which would arise if sellers could enforce terms unknown to buyers) by excusing buyers for their ignorance only when terms are not featured prominently on pre-printed forms.A more recent decision by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia has clarified statutory unconscionability in Australia. The Court decided that unconscionability does not require the offender to take advantage of, or exploit, a vulnerability, disability or disadvantage of the victim. This is particularly important in the context of franchising, where the decision (which may still be challenged in the future in the High Court of Australia) would tend to favour franchisees in disputes over whether unconscionable conduct had occurred. That is, the test for statutory unconscionability remains related to the equitable test. Broadly, it is an action that could not be done in good conscience.It appears that the most popular viewpoint for ascertaining a standard of reasonableness is that of an objective third party, the person Spencer described as looking through the keyhole. Hospital Products v US Surgical Corp the court looked at an ‘intelligent bystander ... in the situation of the parties’ to understand ‘what is to be taken as the intention which reasonable persons would have had if placed in the situation of the parties’. In doing so they further acknowledged that the qualification of reasonableness is ‘usually associated with a best efforts Korobkin, R. (2003).

Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation [1984] HCA 64. ISoF 2021 promise’. In Morpath the court (Fisher, Davies, Neaves, Beaumont and Miles JJ) had to determine a standard for the ‘reasonable user’ in the context of a request to reinterpret an restrictive covenant on land. It held that it means any purpose for which a reasonable neighbour might reasonably use his land after taking into account all the circumstances and the existing character of the neighbourhood and the extent to which the use may interfere with the adjoining owners' comfortable enjoyment of their properties or reduce the value of those properties. Beaumont J, quoting Windeyer J in Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation acknowledged that ‘[R]easonableness is a concept deeply rooted in the common law: and so, in such cases, is the power of a court to say whether a particular decision of that fact is or is not within the bounds of reason.’Business Common Sense  In the interpretation of reasonableness in SFAs, the term ‘business common sense’ plays an important role. For example, the persona of the reasonable businessperson was key in establishing what amounted to ‘reasonable endeavours’ in Woodside. There, the court acknowledged that the meaning of the terms of a ‘commercial contract’ were to be determined by what ‘a reasonable businessperson would have understood those terms to mean’ and accordingly, ‘reasonable endeavours’ are not an absolute obligation; there are boundaries. It is necessarily conditional on what is reasonable in the circumstances, which can include circumstances that may affect a drafter’s business. It was determined that the ‘reasonable endeavours’ clause was held to mean that the non-drafters do not need to forego or sacrifice their business interests when using reasonable endeavours to uphold their contractual obligations.  Cypjayne v Babcock is another case that drew on commercial savoir faire to determine the reasonableness standard. There, the court had to decide whether the ‘reasonable commercial endeavours’ clause in a negotiated contract allowed the buyer to withdraw from a conditional commitment to purchase a retirement village once it decided that it was not in its commercial interests to proceed. The court held that ‘best’ and reasonable endeavours clauses generally imposed similar obligations, being a standard of ‘reasonableness’ that could be measured by  Hospital Products, 92. Mason J.

ISoF 2021 ‘what is reasonable in the circumstances having regard to the nature, capacity, qualifications and responsibilities of the licensee viewed in light of the particular contract.’ Here, the word ‘commercial’ indicated that the parties ‘contemplated the possibility of some commercial steps being needed’ to enable the condition precedent to be fulfilled. This was different from ‘merely making reasonable endeavours to draft documents’ to give effect to arrangements that had already been agreed upon.  Reasonable or rational?  Much commentary exists on the overlap between reasonableness and proportionality and between reasonableness and rationality. Californian torts law professor Gregory Keating highlights the difference between the two concepts; suggesting that reasonableness applies to many people and includes a diverse range of aims or aspirations; while rationality is personal and can be understood as single actors pursuing their own self-interest in an intelligent way.According to Keating:  When we act reasonably, we restrain our pursuit of self-interest by acting in accordance with principles that fix fair terms of cooperation. Reasonable principles reconcile the conflicting aims and interests of different people on terms that each could acknowledge as legitimate if they were to change places with those burdened by the pursuit of their ends. When someone acts rationally, but unreasonably, she pursues her self-interest effectively, but fails to exhibit sufficient respect for the equally legitimate interests of others.In the context of Australian case law, reasonable seems to have two meanings – having a ‘rational’ basis or being ‘appropriate’ in the circumstances. In several cases, rationality has been used as descriptor in defining a test for ‘reasonableness’. Specifically, in McKinnon v Sec Dept reasonable was taken to mean ‘not irrational, absurd or ridiculous’. While in Australian Fisheries the notion of being ‘objectively reasonable’ is outlined to mean ‘rational, based on reason, or capable of sustaining belief’, requiring ‘the objective reasonableness of the accused's belief to be assessed by reference to the subjective circumstances in which the accused was placed, including the accused's personal attributes and the information available to him/her at the time.’  Cypjayne v Babcock [2011] NSWCA 173, 67, citing Mason J in Transfield Pty Limited v Arlo International Limited [1980] HCA 15; (1980) 144 CLR 83, 100 and 101.

ISoF 2021 HO ARE THE PARTIES TO A RANCHISE GREEMENTLord Hoffman may have been talking about franchisees and their franchisors when comparing the approach of parents and landlords.  whereas the reasonable parent displays an almost saintly altruism, the reasonable landlord is entirely selfish.To borrow from Lord Hoffmann’s 1995 Lord Upton Lecture, it is instructive to see who is sitting on today’s Clapham Omnibus on their way to a franchise exhibition at Sydney’s Darling Harbour Convention Centre. ‘The passengers who used to be distinguished by their ordinariness, have become a rather mixed bunch’. Each is thinking about a specific role in relation to a franchise business.  Let us imagine that one is Julia, the Chief Operating Officer of the Australian subsidiary of a franchisor that is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange. She is beautifully groomed, has a business degree from a good university and has been in various roles in the franchisor for 10 years. Her salary, bonuses and job are secure. She has no doubt that franchising is a wonderful business form.  Next to Julia is a man in a well-cut suit. He is the partner in a big city law firm that acts for Julia’s company. He is deep in thought, going over the talk he is going to give at the franchise exhibition. He checks that he has his business cards with him to hand to international franchisors at the exhibition – they are prospective new clients.  Chatting to each other in the middle of the bus are two young people dressed in office attire. They are from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’). They will be at the regulator’s booth for the morning, to answer questions about the Franchising Code of Conduct. They have resources about the Code, and unfair contract terms to distribute. Sitting near the back is Bakti. He is from Indonesia. English is his third language. He does not speak it fluently. His wife has multiple sclerosis so Bakti is looking for a business that will help sustain his family financially into the future, aware that he might not be able to work in the business full time himself if his wife’s health deteriorates. He is confident that he will find what he wants in a franchise.   Lord Hoffman, Anthropomorphic Justice: The Reasonable Man and His Friends, (1995) 29 Law Tchr. 127, 137. 105 Lord Hoffman, Anthropomorphic Justice: The Reasonable Man and His Friends, (1995) 29 Law Tchr. 127. ISoF 2021 In the seat in front of Bakti is Angelo. He had also dreamed of financial stability. In 2003 after spending 30 years in the finance industry in senior roles, he bought a franchise. He and his wife had always wanted to operate a small business. They invested their life savings in a pizza franchise. He wasn’t heading to the exhibition. His destination was the Federal Court as he was in a dispute with his franchisor. All these passengers think of themselves and their views as reasonable. Any rational person, given the opportunity, will create a contract that is in their best interests. A natural imbalance thus arises in the drafting of standard form franchise agreements. The ACCC defines a standard form agreement as one where there is little basis for terms to be negotiated. The business format franchise agreement is a SFA. the most important form of conflict avoidance used today... It can exist because under most legal systems the principle of \"autonomy\" of parties to contracts is recognised, so that parties are free to include in their contract terms of their choice which do not run counter to national law or public policy.A franchise agreement will calibrate numerous requirements using the word ‘reasonable’ to make them appear less one-sided, fairer and to retain flexibility in their application. For example, the 7-Eleven USA 408-page long disclosure package, including franchise agreement, contains over 55 situations when reasonable is used. These are: ‘reasonable amount, mutually agreed, reasonable business and related requirements, a commercially reasonable effort, within a reasonable period of time, a reasonable and representative quantity, upon [franchisee’s] reasonable request, perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance, reasonableness of significant accounting estimates, [the franchisor] believes to be reasonable, expenses and other liabilities are reasonable estimates, [franchisee] agree[s] that the terms of this Agreement are acceptable to you, and are material and reasonable, agreement contains reasonable limitations, reasonable cost, a reasonable number of samples, a reasonable opportunity to cure, the reasonable cash equivalent, in your or our reasonable belief, in our reasonable opinion, total reasonable purchases, reasonable conforming changes, in our sole and reasonable opinion, in our reasonable judgment and regardless of the classification by you or the Internal Revenue Service, reasonable operating standards, at any time upon reasonable notice, that 10 days' notice of any intended sale or disposition of any Collateral is  Atwell, C. & Buchan, J.

John Goldring, Unification and Harmonisation of the Rules of Law, (1978) 9 Fed. L. Rev. 284, 290.  ISoF 2021 reasonable, within a reasonable time after we learn of it, to the reasonable satisfaction of [a mandated supplier], provide [franchisees] with reasonable training, allow [supplier] reasonable space, a reasonable allocation of risk, reasonable attorneys' fees, beyond such party's reasonable control, reasonable steps, when the Director has a reasonable basis to believe, reasonable discretion, as determined by [supplier] in its sole but reasonable discretion, in its reasonable judgment, its reasonable costs, allow [suppliers] reasonable access’. It is clear that the determination of reasonable in any or all of these contexts would require careful consideration of a daunting range of factors.  Franchisors Franchisors are the originator of the franchise concept; then whoever that person sells their business to becomes the replacement franchisor. The franchisor instructs their law firm to draft a franchise agreement. This lawyer is often a member of a big-end-of-town legal team. The brief is for the legal team to make sure the client’s interests are protected. The franchisor client wants adequate compliance with the law, enough clarity, a one-size-fits-all solution, maximum control, consistency, and optimal risk minimisation. They may also want to disincentivise franchisees from pursuing disputes. The franchisor who Julia’s franchisor engages knows, as drafter of the SFA, that even if Bakti and his fellow prospective franchisees read the fine print they cannot negotiate as individuals for the removal of unfavourable terms. They will accept the franchisor’s explanation that the terms must be there to protect the whole system from free riders.  Franchisors today may be the entrepreneur who dreamed up the idea, or a public listed company, a trust or a venture capitalist. Regardless of who they are, they have the upper hand in the drafting of all contracts between themselves and their franchisees. Franchisees The 2016 census stereotypes the ‘typical’ Australian to bea 38-year-old Australian-born of English ancestry. She is married, has two children and lives in a house with three bedrooms. The typical Australian-born male is 37 years old, while the typical migrant was born in England and is 44 years old. Looking around us in cosmopolitan cities like Sydney it is clear that many people who enter SFAs in Australia, including many franchisees, do not fit  7-Eleven Inc, Convenience Stores Uniform Franchise Registration, 2003, Minnesota.  2017 Australian Census.  ISoF 2021 these stereotypes. For example, 7-Eleven franchisees in Australia are from 22 countries, with the highest proportions being from India, China and Pakistan.SFAs are take it or leave it contracts. They are widely used in circumstances where a ‘weaker’ party cannot easily shop around for better terms. They are also widely used in business to business contracts in the context of purchases requiring high sunk costs such as vehicles, retail shop leases, and franchise agreements. How can the reasonable consumer respond? The owner of a new vehicle has access to consumer warranties if the vehicle turns out to be a lemon. The counterparty to a franchise agreement has no ‘as of right’ statutory safety nets if the franchisor turns out to be a lemon, and they are stuck in a long-term relationship regulated, principally, by the terms of a SFA. What, then, is reasonable from the perspective of the prospective franchisee in the context of taking or leaving a standard form franchise agreement? EFINING THE EASONABLE RANCHISOR OR RANCHISEEThe ‘reasonable person’ (historically known as the reasonable man) is the longest established of ‘the select group of personalities who inhabit our legal village and are available to be called upon when a problem arises that needs to be solved objectively’. Who are they? The origins of the ‘reasonable person’ are widely debated. Gary Slapper notes that the Magna Carta spoke of a ‘reasonable aid’. Others suggest that reference to reasonableness in the law can be traced to the period of Enlightenment in England in the 16 and 17 centuries.In his 18 century commentaries, Sir William Blackstone wrote that local customs must be reasonable if they are to bind as law. The first contemporary case law reference to the reasonable person occurred in England in 1703 in R v Jones. There, reference was made to ‘a person of an ordinary capacity’ in distinguishing between civil and criminal liability.

ISoF 2021 A more objective version of the reasonable man appeared in the 1837 tort case, Vaughan v MenloveThere, Mr Menlove had built a haystack close to his neighbours’ cottages. Despite being aware of the risk, he ignored the possibility that the hay might catch alight. It did. His neighbours’ cottages burnt down. He claimed he had not been negligent. The court instructed the jurors to evaluate his conduct not: by the standard of whether he had acted bona fide to the best of his judgment; [as, by that standard], he ought not to be responsible for the misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence’ but ‘with reference to the caution that a prudent man would have observed.Defining the modern-day reasonable franchisor or franchisee is a controversial and complex undertaking. As Lord Hoffmann notes in the context of identifying the reasonable for the purposes of determining liability in tort, to start by investigating ‘personal qualities which requires subjecting the defendant to an IQ test or psychological examination (short of palpable insanity) is in practice too difficult to contemplate’. As Zorzetto recognises, it is common for people to be tempted to define reasonableness by reference to the human stereotype. According to Zorzetto:  A leitmotiv in legal thinking is the judicial tendency belonging to the British common law tradition to evaluate in every field whether people's behaviour is reasonable according to the circumstances: to find a criterion, a measuring rod.While it can be safely assumed that the reasonable person characterisation is no longer satisfied by Lord Judge Greer’s 1933 portrayal that he is ‘the man who takes the magazines home and, in the evening, pushes the lawn mower in his shirt sleeves’ or the Englishman on the Clapham omnibus, accurately encapsulating the diverse characteristics of Australia’s multicultural population and reducing them to ‘a reasonable person’ is an inherently problematic undertaking. Although it has been widely accepted that the reasonable man has been replaced by the reasonable person, the construct has not been adapted further in response to other social categories.  Roy Baker’s research concluded that approximately half the population viewed the ‘ordinary reasonable person’ as someone removed from themselves; a ‘third person’ in a 117 Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490.  118 Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490.

The Australian case law supports this conclusion. But, as Richard Bronaugh argues, there needs to be an understanding of the reasonable person’s subjective reasonableness – that their own subjective beliefs play a significant role in the reasonableness inquiry. On this, Larry DiMatteo identifies:  The subjectivity of judicial decision-making and the objectivity of the reasonable person standard can be said to have a reciprocal relationship. The reasonable person is the inevitable prisoner of the subjective judicial mind.Although the principles of reasonableness can be implied from legislation, legislation does not define the ‘reasonable person’. If required, the identity of the reasonable person in the context of a class of contracts will currently be determined by a court. As the creation of the reasonable person is context specific and an inventive act, judges and juries must assess the factual, circumstantial and cultural landscape, choosing the most pertinent characteristics in fabricating the ‘reasonable person’ in the context of the case. Relying on courts to determine ‘reasonable people’ on a case by case basis is inefficient. It will become increasingly problematic as standard form contracts are drafted using algorithms. Attempt to characterise the reasonable person in the context of an SFA can be best achieved by ascertaining the key characteristics of parties to these types of contracts in Australia.  The vagueness noted by Stone and the flexibility by Mason remain desirable features of consumer contracts, but in our opinion the contract as drafted must be understandable to the consumer to reach a threshold of fairness. In the Federal Court, Beaumont J noted that ‘[R]easonableness is a concept deeply rooted in the common law: and so, in such cases, is the power of a court to say whether a particular decision of that fact is or is not within the bounds of reason’.This power of the court remains true, but problems we now face are that courts are extremely busy and online contracts are being drafted by non-lawyers. Consequently, online contracts are inflexible and arguably often not ‘fit for purpose’ as they contain clauses that are in breach of the Australian Consumer Law, may require dispute resolution by arbitration in a distant jurisdiction, or are even written in a foreign language with no English translation available. Increasingly they will be entirely written using algorithms. This provides speed and  Baker, R.

It also provides an opportunity for the contracts to be far better tailored to the needs of the specific classes of consumer if we know who that reasonable person is. Consistent with trends in the law of construction (that courts consider commercial context when interpreting contracts), it seems that reasonableness is being tied to what is commercial and what commercially interested parties would be taken to have intended. For example, in cases considering ‘reasonable endeavours’, the courts seem to have viewed this concept as watering down a straightforward obligation to do something so that the party who is bound to exercise ‘reasonable endeavours’ to do something is afforded some leeway in how far they go to doing that thing if it turns out not to be the best commercial option at the time, or that there is some other course which would involve less of a sacrifice of the obligees’ commercial, operational or financial interests.What the courts say about ‘reasonable’ in the context of B2B contracts The appeal of ‘reasonable’ in the judicial lacunae is its ability to act as a sponge. It is a porous notion, capable of absorbing the facts and circumstances of the case. In defining what is reasonable the Australian courts have been primarily concerned with the following contexts: reasonable excuse,reasonable endeavours, reasonable care, reasonable due diligence,reasonable use,reasonable grounds, reasonable doubt, reasonable cause, and reasonableness from the promisee or promisor’s perspective. Contracts considered by courts have often been negotiated contracts, not SFAs, with the recent exception of contracts that may breach the unfair contract terms provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act2010 (Cth). Whereas courts acknowledge the impossibility of arriving at an all-encompassing definition, judges have seen the concept as situation and context dependent, and subjective in character.

ISoF 2021 As Russell Korobkin identifies – the ‘reasonable expectations doctrine’ permits courts to invalidate form terms that defeat the expectations of reasonable consumers.The typical contract that is litigated to conclusion is a negotiated contract. Hence, there is relatively little guidance from Australian courts about what is reasonable in the context of standard form contracts. In the business to business (‘B2B’) environment standard form contracts are widely used by retail landlords and by franchisors. A reasonable person becomes owner of a franchised business after signing a franchise agreement. The terms of a unit franchise agreement, a form of SFA, are rarely adapted for specific counter parties. This refusal by the drafter to adapt SFAs to address the wishes of counter parties is one reason that SFAs are seldom read.A franchise agreement is categorised as a B2B transaction but, at the point the franchisee is committing to it, closely resembles a business to consumer transaction. The Franchising Code of Conduct requires parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith with respect to any matter arising under or in relation to the negotiation of a proposed agreement, a formalised agreement or the code.Virk Pty Ltd (in liq) v YUM! Restaurants Australia Pty Ltdone of the issues for the court to decide was whether the franchisor of the Pizza Hut brand was obliged to act reasonably, in an objective sense, in performing its part of the standard form franchise agreement. Reasonableness is relevant in assessing whether good faith existed.  Reasonableness … goes to the quality of the conduct, here in exercising the price setting power, to discern whether it was capricious, dishonest, unconscionable, arbitrary or the product of a motive which was antithetical to the object of the contractual power.  Conduct attended by any of those qualities could never be said to be in good faith.  … Where,there is a finding of good faith (or, specifically, a finding that there was an absence of bad faith…) attaching to the exercise of the contractual power, then that exercise must necessarily also have been reasonable.Citing Renard Constructions, the Virk court observed, Renard Constructions, Priestley J (Handley JA agreeing) concluded that a particular contractual power, including a power to vary or cancel the contract, was required to be exercised reasonably [168]. His Honour observed (at 263) that the kind of reasonableness to which he was referring had much in  Korobkin, R. (2003). Bounded rationality, standard form contracts, and unconscionability.

ISoF 2021 common with the notions of good faith found in many European civil law systems, and all states of the United States of America, as necessarily implied in many kinds of contract. But, in the Renard Constructions case, the contract being examined was a negotiated contract, not an SFA like the single unit pizza franchise contracts in Virk.  Another agreement, this time relating to the Burger King franchise and its Australian area developer, Hungry Jacks, was considered in the Virk decision. This case concerned the Area Developer Agreement. While much of the contract is an SFA, the remainder will have been vigorously negotiated. Virk noted: The New South Wales Court of Appeal in Burger King considered the existence and scope of an implied obligation of good faith and reasonableness in a commercial contract.  [It] concluded that such an obligation attached to a particular provision (cl 4.1) in the Development Agreement ....  Burger King, the breach of the implied obligation of good faith and reasonableness was by reason of the appellant’s use of its contractual discretion under clause 4.1 for a purpose foreign to that for which it was granted.  In that case, what was reasonable was ascertained by reference to the terms of the contract. … Importantly, … it may also be seen that ‘reasonableness’ as an adjunct to an obligation of good faith has never been regarded as a duty to exercise due care and skill or to produce a reasonable outcome. Thus, the expressions within the composite phrase are necessarily and closely related.  Consideration of the reasonableness of a party’s conduct will inform the question of whether good faith or its absence has been brought to the performance of the contractual obligation or exercise of the power. This is what the court assumed in Virk but isn’t this the conduct that is exactly what the Code promotes through the modified obligation imposed on both parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith through Clause 6(6) stating that ‘To avoid doubt, the obligation to act in good faith does not prevent a party to a franchise agreement, or a person who proposes to become such a party, from acting in his, her or its legitimate commercial interestsMore recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltdthe Federal Courtconsidered the requirement that a franchisor act in good faith. Ultra TuneAustralia Pty Ltd, is a franchisor for motor vehicle engine repair and maintenance services with approximately 200 franchises. The court found that Ultra Tune had failed to give the franchisee a reasonable time to consider the purchase of the franchise and had therefore breached its obligation to act in good faith.

ISoF 2021 ONCLUSION As we have seen, scholars from many jurisdictions have weighed in on what is ‘reasonable’ in the law, and, specifically, in contracts. Is it appropriate to continue to rely on interpreting who the reasonable is ex ante in disputes about matters regulated by franchise agreements? We think not. Apart from the franchisor-suppliers’ nod to statutory compliance, the notion of a franchise agreement as an SFA being made between reasonable people is not a given. Do Judges have the opportunity to consider whether franchisors or their franchisees were more reasonable? The answer for the overwhelming number must be ‘no’. Few franchise disputes are resolved in court. Can franchisees, and even many franchisors, afford to pay the courts to ponder such fundamental questions? The arguments about who the reasonable pizza franchisee was in YUM Brands took a full day with four barristers presenting evidence before three judges. This level of representation is beyond the reach of most. We are in trouble if we accept, as Silvia Zorzetto suggests, that: what is reasonable or unreasonable depends on both facts and values that are not predetermined. This means that abstract criteria of reasonableness do not exist at all and the reasonable is porous and context dependent.Former New Zealand Judge Sir Edmund Thomas writes that ‘a law that is out of step with the needs and expectation of the times is not serving the society it is designed to serve. It is failing in its basic function’. The ability to identify ex ante the characteristics of the reasonable person in the role of either drafter or consumer of a SFA, and the expectations that person would bring to contractual rights and duties in 21st century Australia is essential for the law of contract to serve users well. Traditional contract theory was developed at a time when there was a limited use of SFAs. Now, as SFAs continue to grow in use and prevalence for all sizes of transactions, and resolution of contract disputes through algorithms becomes popular, the concept of reasonableness and the actions and thoughts of a ‘reasonable person’ cannot be left solely to courts; it requires proactive interpretation. The challenges should be addressed ex ante to ensure that contract law remains relevant as a way of interpreting SFAs. One obligation of the commercial lawyer and the commercial judge is to understand the limits of legitimate self-interest and the relationship between self-interest, in its inherently selfish character (that is, the search for commercial gain), and honesty, reasonableness, mutual respect, reciprocity, decency and trust, being the qualities that make it possible for commercial people to be self-interested, but to at 148 Zorzetto, S.

ISoF 2021 the same time deal with each other peacefully, with mutual benefit and to promote long term commercial success.The reasonable franchisor or franchisee is alternately altruistic and selfish. What is considered reasonable from the perspective of the prospective franchisee entering into a standard form franchise agreement will differ significantly from the standard of reasonableness that is adopted by a franchisor drafting the same agreement. Justice Brenan observed that  legislatures have disappointed the theorists and the courts have been left with a substantial part of the responsibility for keeping the law in a serviceable state, a function which calls for consideration of the contemporary values of the community.Given the high-stakes nature of business format franchise relationships, and the reliance on a standard of reasonableness, it is not a satisfactory outcome for franchisees to determine what amounts to reasonable conduct retrospectively and only after an issue or dispute arises. This article has documented the current reality facing prospective and current franchisees. Future research and inquiry should focus on determining the ex-ante determination of such a standard of reasonableness in the context of standard form agreements.150 Chief Justice Allsop AO, Values in Law: How they Influence and Shape Rules and the Application of Law, 20 October 2016. 2016 Hochelaga Lecture, Centre for Comparative and Public Law Faculty of Law, University of Hong Kong.

Franchisees as opportunistic agents or trusted stewards Abstract This conceptual paper critiques the traditional view of franchisees as agents of the franchisor, an approach that has dominated the franchise literature, and proposes a conceptual model of franchisee stewardship. We argue that the atomistic perspective of human nature associated with agency theory may promulgate franchise governance systems which actually promote the opportunistic behaviors they seek to reduce. In contrast, by adopting a communitarian philosophy, we propose that instead of viewing franchisees solely as agents, franchisees should also be considered as potential stewards of the franchise system. We explain how such a complementary perspective could provide novel insights for theory development and practice. Key words: agency theory, communitarianism, stewardship theory, organizational identification, franchising. What does it mean to be a franchisee?  Franchisees as opportunistic agents or trusted stewards INTRODUCTION This paper explores the relevance of stewardship theory for studying franchisee behaviors within franchise organizations. We contrast this with the dominant theory in the franchising literature (and indeed the wider management literature), that of agency theory (Barthélemy, 2011). Whilst researchers have begun to respond to indications by various scholars (such as Combs, Michael & Castrogiovanni, 2009; Dant, Grünhagen & Windsperger, 2011; Gillis, McEwan, Crook & Michael, 2011) to look beyond the traditional agency explanations of franchising, this theory still dominates. The agency approach sees franchisees as agents with divergent interests to the principal (franchisor). Thus, much of the franchise literature explores how franchisees can be monitored and controlled to ensure that they do not engage in opportunistic behavior to the detriment of the system (Barthelemy, 2011; Brown, Weaven, Dant & Crosno, 2016; Dant & Nasr, 1998).  The dominant view of franchisees as opportunistic agents is interesting, as many scholars (e.g. Brickley & Dark, 1987; Castrogiovanni, Combs & Justis, 2006; Rubin, 1978) explain franchising as a means of reducing the agency concerns associated with company ownership. Since franchisees are residual agents, whose compensation is directly tied to the performance of their outlets (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2009), franchising should help align the goals of the principal (franchisor) and agent (franchisee). As such, franchisees should be less likely to shirk than employee-managers. Similarly, franchising should overcome issues of adverse selection. Unlike managers who may be incentivized to misrepresent their skills and abilities (Chrisman, 2019), franchisees are assumed to have little incentive to misrepresent themselves, given they are making substantial upfront investments into the system, and their income is directly linked with the performance of their outlets (Shane, 1996). Thus, franchising should alleviate concerns of agentic behavior. Nevertheless, the literature still considers franchisees as agents with tendencies to free-ride on the efforts of the franchisor and other system members (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2009). We propose that our understanding of franchisee behaviors, and therefore system outcomes, can be improved by employing an alternate and complementary perspective to the agentic one, that of stewardship. Stewardship theory explores “situations in which managers are not motivated by individual goals, but rather are stewards whose motives are aligned with the objectives of their principals” (Davis, Schoorman & Donaldson, 1997, p. 21). We propose that franchisees should be seen as potential stewards of the system, and factors which might help promote stewardship behaviors should be explored. In this regard, we argue that the application of stewardship (rather than agency theory) has important implications, because, as Ghoshal notes (2005, p. 77), “a theory that assumes that people can behave opportunistically and draws its conclusions for managing people based on that assumption can induce managerial actions that are likely to enhance opportunistic behavior among people” (emphasis added). Thus, our purpose here is to show how ignoring other potential premises for explaining behavior (beyond agency) within franchise relationships, can lead to incomplete or potentially unreliable conclusions.  It is not our intention, however, to refute the role of agency theory in franchise research, but to contribute by showing why and how stewardship theory should also be incorporated, based on realistic and relevant assumptions, as Chrisman (2019) and Purkayastha, Veliyath and George (2019) emphasize. Whilst stewardship perspectives are not new to the entrepreneurship literature, its application has essentially been restricted to family firms (Chrisman, 2019; Lim, Lubatkin & Wiseman, 2010; Lumpkin, Steier & Wright, 2011; Madison, Holt, Kellermanns & Ranft 2016; Miller, Le Breton-Miller & Scholnick, 2008). Through our development of a theory of franchisee stewardship we seek to make a number of contributions. First, we consider how adopting a different assumption of human behavior can lead to dramatically different conclusions as to how to approach the management of franchisees. In seeking to understand how franchisees can be considered as stewards of the system, we challenge the self-serving assumptions about human nature upon which agency theory is based. By adopting an alternative philosophy of human nature, one that is other-regarding, we explore how social identification processes may align franchisee and franchisor goals, to enable franchisee stewardship. Second, we propose a framework of franchisee stewardship through an identification and articulation of a number of potential antecedent factors. Whilst the wider stewardship literature has proposed a number of factors which can contribute towards stewardship, this is the first paper to our knowledge, to explore and develop these within the particular context of franchise organizations. Finally, the paper provides a number of practical suggestions as to how the model can be applied in future research to enable empirical testing and further theory development. We begin the paper by exploring the key assumptions of human behavior upon which agency theory is based, and contrast these with those used in stewardship theory. Based on this discussion we then identify a number of factors which may influence the presence of franchisee stewardship and propose a framework which could be empirically tested in future studies. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN? To understand why an agency perspective of franchisees may not provide the sole explanation for their behavior, it is necessary to explore its underlying assumptions of what it means to be human. As Simon (1985, p. 293) observes “nothing is more fundamental in setting our research agenda and informing our research methods than our view of the nature of human beings whose behavior we are studying”. Agency theory has taken an atomistic perspective of the individual, i.e., a Homo Economicus view, where humans are freestanding agents who make rational decisions based on self-interest maximization (Etzioni, 2014; Rawls, 1971). This individualist philosophy has led to assumptions about shirking, opportunism and inertia in the economic analysis of companies (Ghoshal, 2005).  This Homo Economicus view of humans is not without its critics. As far back as Aristotle, there have been arguments suggesting that individuals are not purely self-regarding, but are other-regarding too. As Taylor (1985, p. 190) asserts “man is by nature of member of a community [and a] social animal… because he is not self-sufficient outside a polis”. Communitarian philosophy assumes that “human nature is to a significant extent socially constituted” (Etzioni, 1996, p. 164). Community membership creates rights and duties, where individuals strive to achieve socially affirmed and collectively valued goals (Watson, Shepard & Stephens, 1999). In this regard, the sense of self is to a significant extent constituted by the community within which the individual resides. Whilst communitarian principles have largely been used to explore the role of the state (Avineri & De-Shalit, 1992; Sandel, 1984; Taylor, 2005), the underlying philosophy has applications to organizations, as a form of community (Drucker, 1939; Melé, 2012; Solomon, 1994). In this sense, before exploring further the implications of a communitarian philosophy on franchise research, we justify our assertion that franchise systems, and indeed firms more broadly, can be viewed as a community.WHAT IS A FIRM? Within the business literature, there are two dominant views of the firm – one as a nexus of contracts, and the other as a set of concurrent interests (Melé, 2012). For those that view the firm as a nexus of contracts, the firm refers to “…a group of individuals who engage in a particular type of contractual relationship with each other” (Hessen, 1979, p. 8). In this context, employees (or in this case franchisees) are simply agents who perform some activity on behalf of the business owner (principal), and the firm is a “legal fiction” which serves as a nexus for contracting relationships (Jensen & Meckling, 1976, p. 311). Whilst this view of the firm has been extended to consider social and relational contracts (indeed, the franchise literature often refers to relational contracting [Evanschitzky, Caemmerer & Backhaus, 2016;Hendrikse, Hippmann & Windsperger, 2015;Leblebici & Shalley,1996]), the fundamental premise is that a firm is little more than a series of contracts between the principal and agents or other stakeholders (Solomon, 1994). The alternative perspective sees firms as connected networks of stakeholder interests, or “… a complex set of relationships between and among interest groups with different rights, objectives, expectations, and responsibilities” (Clarkson, 1995, p. 107). However, as Melé (2012) notes, these perspectives are insufficient in their consideration of the human aspects. Melé (2012) thus proposes that businesses should be viewed as a community of persons. A community, as defined by Solomon (1994, p. 227), is “an open-ended and immensely complex set of relationships between its members, who may, within that context, be called ‘individuals’”. This view of a business as a community has important implications in thinking about how individuals within that community behave. Communitarianism contends that people will abide by social norms to avoid social censure. Following an Aristotelean view there is an assumption that people, as naturally social and benevolent (Solomon, 1994), seek approval from other members of the community, and “by nature desire of being what ought to be approved of, or of being what he himself approves of in other men” (Solomon, 1994, p. 281). These social bonds, and appropriation of the community values, means that the social context is “to a significant extent perceived as a legitimate and integral part of one’s existence, as a ‘We’ rather than a ‘They’” (Etzioni, 1996, p. 157). Our fundamental beliefs about human nature, and the nature of the firm have important implications for theory and practice. By assuming that human beings are inherently other-regarding rather than self-serving, or at least both other-regarding and self-interested (Chrisman, 2019; Van de Ven, Sapienza, & Villanueva, 2007), this changes our predictions and explanations as to how people behave within organizational contexts. Indeed, as Ghoshal (2005, p. 85) argues, “it would vastly change our theory”. In the following sections therefore, we consider how a communitarian philosophy of human nature might influence franchisee behaviors and, consequently, management and governance approaches. A STEWARDSHIP THEORY PERSPECTIVE Franchise research has been heavily reliant on agency theory in exploring how best to manage franchisees (Barthélemy, 2011; Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Quinn, 1999). These agency arguments assume that franchisees, as agents of the franchisor, may engage in opportunistic behavior. Such behavior may entail suboptimal effort (Watson & Johnson, 2010) where the franchisee free-rides on the reputation of the system, or engages in activities that, although potentially injurious to the brand in the long run, provides benefits to the individual franchisee (Dant & Nasr, 1998). This view of franchisees as fundamentally self-serving individuals, creates assertions such as those by Kidwell, Nygaard and Silkoset (2007, p. 523) that the “…effectiveness of franchising as a successful organizational form can be undermined by failure to control opportunistic behavior”, and has led to a substantial emphasis on franchise governance, and approaches to limit the opportunistic behavior of franchisees (Brown et al., 2016; Evanschitzky et al., 2016).  The franchise literature has therefore focused on trying to solve the ‘negative problem’ of human behavior(Ghoshal, 2005). But are franchisees inherently driven by the need to gain personal advantage, or, is the primary self-interest that of the desire for approval and respect from the community (in this case franchise system)? If the former, then by introducing fiat, monitoring, and controls, opportunistic behaviors can be reduced (Goshal & Moran, 1996). If, however, the latter, then the introduction of hierarchical controls, will provide signals to managers (or in this case franchisees) that “they are neither to be trusted nor trustworthy to behave appropriately without such controls” (Ghoshal, 2005, p. 85). The controls will in themselves create a negative feeling towards the organization, increasing the propensity to behave opportunistically (Ghoshal and Moran, 1996). Within the context of franchising, where franchisees “… did not enter business to be a franchisor’s management thrall” (Kidwell et al., 2007, p. 527), it has been acknowledged that the monitoring of franchisees may produce a ‘crowding out effect’, where the intended disciplining effect of monitoring is overtaken by dysfunctional behaviors “due to decreased motivation or reactance to loss of autonomy and control” (Brown et al., 2016, p. 30).  Stewardship theory (Davis et al., 1997), underpinned by an Aristotelean or communitarian view of human nature, sees managers’ primary motivations as being to service the organization’s best interests (Pearson & Marler, 2010), i.e., to engage in pro-social behaviors which put the long-term interests of the organization (community) ahead of personal goals (Hernandez, 2012).Individuals are not just motivated by economic considerations, but also by higher level needs, such as self-actualization, through the fulfilment of personal values and aspirations (Donaldson, 1990; Le Breton Miller & Miller, 2009) and thus, even where the interests of the individual and the principal (organization) are not aligned, a higher value is placed on cooperation rather than defection (opportunism) (Davis et al., 1997). The individual perceives the utility gained from pro-organizational behavior to be higher than the utility that can be gained through individualistic, self-serving behavior (Davis et al., 1997). Under such circumstances, stewardship theory would suggest that empowering governance structures and mechanisms are the most appropriate to enhance organizational performance (Davis et al., 1997; Hernandez, 2012). It has been noted that franchisee empowerment is important in order to ensure the success of franchise system (López-Bayón & López-Fernández, 2016It is worth emphasizing that stewardship does not purport that no franchisee will behave opportunistically – but rather that in the main, they are primarily other-regarding (Wilson, 1993). Where franchisees engage in opportunistic or dysfunctional behaviors they should be punished, but not assumed to be innately self-serving. As Solomon (1994, p. 280) argues, “presume cooperation, but hit ‘em hard if they cheat”. In other words, stewardship assumptions do not preclude monitoring activities, but rather that these are grounded on trust.  CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND PROPOSITIONS Having argued that our normative perception of franchisees should involve their roles as stewards of the system, it is important to consider factors which might help promote, or indeed ‘crowd out’ (Brown et al., 2016) stewardship behaviors. Drawing from a review of the stewardship and franchising literatures we develop a conceptual framework and propositions with respect to the key antecedents to franchisee stewardship. We firstly present the framework (depicted in Figure 1), and then explore the identified antecedent factors in greater detail, and suggest potential areas for future research in relation to these.  Figure 1: A conceptual framework of franchisee stewardship As the model shows, we suggest that franchisee stewardship behaviors will be affected by the extent to which franchisees identify with the franchise organization. Organizational identification refers to the degree to which an individual’s own identity and his/her perceptions of the organization’s identity are tied together or overlap (Davis et al., 1997; Lange et al., 2015), such that through identification, an organization becomes an extension of the individual’s psychological structure (Davis et al., 1997). Employees who identify with an organization treat the organization’s successes and failures as their own, motivating them to “work toward the organization's goals, solve its problems, and overcome barriers that are preventing the successful completion of tasks and assignments” (Davis et al., 1997, p. 30). Further, employees who identify strongly with an organization, are more likely to act in protection of its values, and thus “… identification with the company serves to align the interests of individuals with organizational goals, fostering stewardship” (Hernandez, 2008, p. 125). In this regard, organizational identification is seen as critical in developing stewardship behaviors (Pierce, Kostova & Dirks, 2001).  Whilst the relationship between organizational identification and stewardship is well established, the antecedents to organizational identification are less well established (Reade, 2001). However, given that organizational identification is a form of social identification (Ashforth and Mael, 1989) it is not surprising that a number of researchers have suggested that identification is influenced by interpersonal relationships, especially between employer and employee (Edwards and Peccei, 2010; Hernandez, 2008; Tyler and Blader, 2003).  Indeed, Tyler and Blader (2003) suggest that the degree to which individuals identify with their employer will be influenced by the degree to which they treat employees fairly. However, whilst relationships with leaders are important, and indeed the importance of good franchisee-franchisor relationships have long been recognized in the literature (López-Bayón & López-Fernández, 2016), it has also been suggested that intergroup relations are influential in identification processes, with positive interpersonal relationships highlighted by a number of authors as promoting identification (Ashforth and Mael, 1989; Brown et al., 1986; Reade, 2001). We therefore propose a construct, franchise community relationships, to capture the effect of both franchisor-franchisee and inter-network relationships on organizational identification. Perceptions of franchise community relations will in turn be influenced by a number of factors. As Edwards and Peccei (2010) note, perceptions of organizational support will enhance perceptions of fairness, i.e. will improve relationship quality. Organizations that operate in a procedurally just manner provide information to employees that they are valued and respected. In this regard, providing employees (or in this case franchisees) with voice, and autonomy to ensure there are opportunities to be involved in decision making, helps signal to individuals within the organization that this is the case. We therefore propose that franchisee autonomy will influence franchise community relations, and in turn identification and stewardship. We argue that to demonstrate procedural justice, and provide ‘voice’ for franchisees, the presence of procedures and systems, or knowledge sharing routines, by which franchisees can participate in decision-making, will be important in promoting good community relations. Finally, we argue that given the role of leadership in shaping social exchanges within an organization (Pearson and Marler, 2010), leaders within the franchise organization will influence the quality of community relationships. Having introduced the model, in the following sections, we further develop our conceptual arguments, put forward a set of propositions, and where applicable contrast our arguments with the predictions from an agency lens. We review our current knowledge from the extant literature and consider potential avenues for further research which emerge from the model to further our understanding of franchisee behaviors. Organizational identification  Although there are many definitions of organizational identification (Edwards, 2005), it can be seen as a form of social identification (Ashforth & Mael, 1989), or identification with the community.  Social identity theory describes how the self may not only be deﬁned in terms of “unique, individuating characteristics that distinguish the individual from others”, but may also be extended to include social groups (van Knippenberg & Sleebos, 2006, p. 572). Ashforth & Mael (1989) propose that this approach can be applied to organizations (as a form of community), whereby individuals deﬁne the self in terms of the membership in the organization, or the perceived oneness with the organization (Ashforth & Mael, 1989; Mael & Ashforth, 1992). In this sense, organizational identiﬁcation reﬂects the psychological merging of self and organization, i.e., from ‘I’ to ‘we’ (Tyler & Blader, 2000; van Knippenberg & Sleebos, 2006). Strong identification causes the organization’s values, norms and interests to be subsumed into the self-concept. Thus, as van Knippenburg and Sleebos (2006, p. 571) comment “collective interest is experienced as the self-interest (i.e., the collective self-interest), and individuals are intrinsically motivated to contribute to the collective”.  Organizational identification is accompanied by affective and behavioral components (Cremer, van Dijke & Bos, 2006; Ertürk, 2010). Individuals who identify strongly with their organization are more likely to focus on tasks that benefit the whole organization rather than self-interested objectives (Dutton, Dukerich & Harquail, 1994; Ertürk, 2010), i.e., engage in stewardship. It is thus suggested that organizational identification will be associated with co-operative behaviors, greater motivation towards achieving organizational goals, and intention to remain within the organization (Edwards, 2005; Jones & Volpe, 2011).  Therefore, strong organizational identification can create stewardship behaviors.   Despite the substantial body of work on organizational identity, there has been little research which has considered this within franchising (Watson, Dada, Grünhagen & Wollan, 2016),  and no studies to the authors’ knowledge that have directly explored the role of organizational identification by franchisees on their behavior and performance. However, there are a few studies which provide some initial insights.  Ullrich, Wieseke, Christ, Schulze and Van Dick (2007) explore the impact of identification on corporate citizenship behaviors by franchisee employees. Their study considers different levels of identification: identification with the franchisee organization (unit) and identification with the franchisor. They find that employee identification is positively related to behavior benefiting the franchisee organization (i.e. customer orientation), and the franchise system (i.e. corporate citizenship behaviors). Another study which implies positive outcomes from identification, although it does not measure it directly, but rather based on affective commitment, is that of Mignonac, Vandenberghe, Perrigot, El Akremi and Herrbach (2015). They find that affective commitment (the emotional attachment based on a sense of identification) is positively related to franchisee productivity and negatively related to franchisee opportunism.  In considering the role of identification, it is relevant to consider the potential differential effect of different levels or types of organizational identification. Lawrence and Kaufmann (2019) find evidence through their qualitative study of franchisees, that franchisees may see the identity of the organization which owns the brand (the franchisor) as distinct from the brand itself, even when they share the same name.Lawrence and Kaufmann (2019) argue that where there have been changes in the ownership or management of the franchise, the loss of the founder, or changes in relational norms, franchisees come to make a cognitive distinction between the brand and the brand owners (franchisor). Interestingly, they find some evidence to suggest that where the identities of the brand and the brand owner (corporation) are perceived to have diverged, franchisee identification is often stronger towards the brand, rather than the franchisor. In this sense, the enduring ‘community’ to which the franchisee belongs, is that of the brand, its loyal customers and fellow franchisees. Whilst beyond the scope of Lawrence and Kaufmann’s (2019) study, this does raise interesting questions about how different forms of identification may impact behaviors. For example, it might be that where identification is weak towards the franchisor, but strong towards the brand, franchisees may engage in stewardship behaviors in some contexts (so behaving in a manner which furthers the brand reputation), but opportunistic in others (for example deliberately withholding information from the franchisor). The studies by Lawrence and Kaufmann (2011, 2019) also raise interesting questions about temporal aspects of identification. Their studies suggest that identification may not be stable – they find evidence of disidentification from the franchisor, where there have been changes in ownership or management. Another situation might also be exemplified, where there has been a change in senior management at a franchise organization, comprising individuals with strong personalities, a franchisee who once identified strongly with the franchise organization might not do so anymore. Some studies have suggested that organizational identification can emerge from leader identification (Horstmeier, Boer, Homan and Voelpel, 2017), and thus changes in leadership may lead to changes in identification. We therefore argue that research exploring the potential consequences of, and antecedents to disidentification could contribute to theory development, and propose that:  P1: Franchisees who identify with the franchise system more strongly will have a greater propensity to engage in stewardship behaviors. Franchise community relationships From a stewardship perspective, community relations have been found to be important determinants of organizational identification, and therefore stewardship behaviors. Relationships play a pivotal role in organizational identification “because of the formative and sense-making role that relationships typically play in shaping one’s experience with the organization” (Sluss and Ashforth, 2008, p. 808). Indeed, a number of authors highlight the critical importance of perceptions of fairness and trust in both organizational identification and stewardship behaviors (Davis et al., 1997: Edwards, 2009; Hernandez, 2008). Just as strong relationships promote identification, conflict has been found to result in disidentification. If franchisors are perceived not to be acting fairly (either to the individuals themselves or a trusted network member or group of members), this may lead to a breach of the psychological contract that franchisees have with their franchisor. Breaches signal to franchisees (employees) that they are not valued members of the organization and can lead to disidentification (Kreiner and Ashforth, 2004; Zagenczyk et al., 2013).  Whilst the franchise literature has long emphasized the importance of fostering strong franchisor-franchisee relationships (Blut et al., 2011; Clarkin & Swavely, 2006; López-Bayón & López-Fernández, 2016), this has generally been grounded in a view of franchisees as agents of the franchisor. The literature, drawing on social exchange theory, has identified the importance of social exchanges, and reciprocity (Davies, Lassar, Manolis, Prince & Winsor, 2011; Meek, Davis–Sramek, Baucus & Germain, 2011), but often the need to control franchisees is discussed alongside these ideas. Although reciprocity has been explored in a positive sense, such that showing trust is likely to be reciprocated, the impact of ‘negative’ exchanges is less explored. In this regard, the extant literature provides few insights into how otherwise ‘other-regarding’ franchisees respond to exchanges which suggest an absence of trust. Actions by franchisors which imply an absence of trust in their franchisees, may create a psychological breach, and lead to organizational disidentification (Kreiner and Ashforth, 2004). Indeed, there is some evidence from Brown et al. (2016) that monitoring of franchisees may lead to an increase in opportunism, although they find differential effects dependent on the nature of the monitoring – behavioral or outcome – whereby behavioral monitoring actually exacerbates franchisee opportunism. They also find differential effects dependent on the quality of the franchise relationship. This suggests that agency governance may quash stewardship behaviors – that is to say, if franchisees are treated as if they cannot be trusted, this creates a psychological breach, disidentification and loss of stewardship. Whilst the extant franchise literature has highlighted the importance of franchisor-franchisee relationships, we suggest it would benefit from giving consideration to the exact relationships being explored between franchisor and franchisee. As noted by Croonen (2010) and Grace, Frazer, Weaven and Dant (2016), in exploring issues of trust, franchisees may differentiate trust in the franchisor (as an individual), and trust in the Head Office Team (as a collective). They use the term ‘system trust’ to differentiate this collective relational attribute. Given the importance of trust in promoting stewardship behaviors, these findings suggest that having a better understanding of the role of the Head Office team in creating a trusting relationship could lead to theoretical advancements. Although the extant literature provides clear evidence that franchisor-franchisee relationships matter, there is a dearth of literature that has considered how franchisee-franchisee relations may also impact franchisee behaviors. As noted earlier, drawing on a communitarian philosophy, the norms and expectations of a community (in this case franchise system) are believed to play an important guiding-role, where individuals will seek to behave in a manner which will be approved of by their community. It would, therefore, seem probable that franchisee-franchisee relationships are important in the development and retention of a strong network community.  The limited literature which has explored franchisee-franchisee relationships does suggest that they matter. For example, Grace et al. (2016) argue that franchisee camaraderie (both between franchisees, and franchisee camaraderie with their franchisor) is an important component of a team culture, which in turn helps create trust in the franchisor. Rometsch and Sydow (2006) argue that social space is important for promoting organizational identification, and suggest that franchisee based groups and conferences could provide avenues for franchisee organizational identity to emerge. Whilst couched in agency theory, Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2011) contend that inter-franchisee networks are a means of limiting franchisee opportunism. We propose that their research could be extended to determine whether inter-franchisee relationships promote identification and stewardship behaviors, rather than simply focusing on reduction of agentic concerns. Inter-franchisee networks may also be important in understanding knowledge-sharing processes (Paswan and Wittman, 2009; Meiseberg et al., 2017). Meiseberg et al. (2017) suggest that by building inter-franchisee relationships, franchisees can form advice networks to help individuals become more productive. Thus, the knowledge-sharing routines that the franchisor establishes may have important implications not just for franchisor-franchisee relationships, but also for inter-franchisee networks. This could be particularly relevant for systems operating in collectivistic cultures, where a high value is placed on social ties (Leeds, 1998). Indeed, in China the term guanxi signifies a kin-like tie (Leeds, 1998) where the informal personal connections between individuals create an implicit psychological contract (Yeung, Brookes & Altinay, 2016). Interestingly there has been almost no research which has considered the role of guanxi in franchise networks (Yeung et al., 2016 being the notable exception), despite the large Chinese diaspora. Whilst we argue that franchise system community relationships promote identification and stewardship behaviors, it also seems probable that strong identification may help promote strong community relationships. This can be explained by homophily (similarity attraction) (Reagans, 2005); individuals with similar values are more likely to be connected and to communicate with each other. Indeed, Reagans (2005) finds that identification increases the likelihood of strong ties. It is therefore proposed that:  Cohesive franchise system community relations, with respect to both inter-franchisee network relationships and franchisee-franchisor relationship quality, will have a positive influence on franchisees’ organizational identification. : Strong organizational identification will have a positive influence on franchise system community cohesion. Franchisee autonomy Although in the organizational identification literature, autonomy has been seen as having a positive impact on identification and stewardship behaviors (David et al, 1997; Edwards, 2009), within the context of franchising, and its associations of a highly standardized system, the extent to which franchisees can be granted autonomy has been a source of debate (Watson & Dada, 2017). Central to the arguments are that autonomous franchisees may engage in adaptations which may be injurious to the brand; thus, their role should be reduced to simply executing standardized practices and procedures set out for them by their franchisors (Watson & Dada, 2017). But, under stewardship assumptions, franchisors should trust franchisees not to engage in behaviors that would be detrimental to the brand, and maximize autonomy to exploit stewardship (Davis et al., 1997). Given franchising is often sold to franchisees as an opportunity to be their own boss (Dada & Watson, 2013), autonomy may be seen as part of the psychological contract that the franchisee has entered into, and therefore attempts to quash franchisee autonomy may demotivate at the least, and lead to agency (opportunistic) behaviors at worse. Indeed, a recent study by Watson, Senyard and Dada (2020) finds that franchisees who felt their autonomy is unfairly limited, engage in innovations that are ‘hidden’ from the franchisor, suggesting that restricting franchisees’ autonomy may actually be counterproductive.  The impact of franchisee autonomy on franchise performance has attracted some empirical research. For example, López-Bayón and López-Fernández (2016) suggest that where decision-making authority is withdrawn from local advertising and human resource decisions, franchise terminations will increase. However, they also suggest that franchise systems will benefit from centralizing pricing, as the decentralization of pricing decisions may encourage intra-system price competition. Underlying this assertion is an assumption that franchisees are self-serving rather than being concerned with the community of which they are part. Whilst López-Bayón and López-Fernández (2016) do find empirical evidence to support their argument, they also highlight the need for contingent factors to be considered. It might be that agency governance has dismantled a sense of community among the franchisees, and thus other-regarding behaviors are not apparent. Kidwell et al.’s (2007) study provides some support for this – they find that centralization (i.e., reduced franchisee autonomy) has counterproductive effect on free-riding behaviors. Furthermore, the results from Watson, Dada, López-Fernández and Perrigot’s (2020) international study of franchisees from four countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Spain) suggest that having proactive franchisees who are engaged in entrepreneurial behaviors enhances franchisor-franchisee relationship quality.  It would seem, therefore, that attempts to unduly curtail the franchisee’s ability to engage in local market adaptations (through restricted autonomy) may impact franchisee community relations, and in turn stewardship behaviors. We therefore propose that: : Franchisee autonomy will have a positive influence on franchisor-franchisee relationship quality. Knowledge sharing routines  The governance processes and structures used to manage franchisees we believe will have important implications for community relations, organizational identification and franchisee stewardship. To ensure perceptions of procedural justice, a sense of ‘voice’, and of being valued and respected, knowledge sharing routines and processes which facilitate communication and provide opportunities for franchisees to participate in decision-making will be key (Edwards and Peccei, 2010; Tyler and Blader, 2003). Indeed, a number of authors suggest that agency governance may promote the very behaviors it seeks to avoid (Davis et al., 1997; Ghoshal, 2005; Ghoshal and Moran, 1996; Hernandez, 2012) if assumptions of a Homo Economicus model of man are incorrect.  A number of studies within the extant franchise literature highlight the potential role of formalized procedures and systems to promote participative practices, autonomy, and participation in decision-making (de Resende Melo et al., 2013; Gillis & Combs, 2009; Watson et al., 2016). For example, Gillis and Combs (2009) argue that knowledge-sharing routines, such as franchise councils and local and regional meetings which celebrate franchisee innovations, are significant relational assets, giving franchisees ‘voice’ within the system. Such routines or practices, by promoting frequent interactions, have the potential to ensure values and goals are being communicated, creating stronger affective bonds (or identification) (Kidwell et al., 2007). Other researchers highlight the importance of franchise councils, associations or committees in creating co-operative behaviors between the franchisor and franchisees (Lawrence & Kaufmann, 2011). Certainly, Lawrence and Kaufmann (2011) emphasize the important role that franchisee associations play in the identification process. Thus, understanding how routines and structures which promote interactions and participative practice influence identification and promote stewardship, represents a significant line of future enquiry. The work by Croonen and Bleeker (2019) provides seven key principles of ‘fair’ franchisee advisory councils, i.e. those which genuinely provide franchisees with a meaningful platform for their views to be exchanged. Future research could explore if/how the presence of these criteria in knowledge sharing structures affect identification and stewardship behaviors. Thus, we propose that:  The presence of knowledge sharing routines will have a positive influence on franchise system community relations. Leadership The importance of leadership, and in particular transformational leadership in creating strong community and organizational identification has been highlighted by a number of studies (He & Brown, 2013; Hernandez, 2008; Horstmeier et al., 2017; Pearson & Marler, 2010). Through their The seven core principles are (1) the consistency principle, (2) the bias-suppression principle, (3) the accuracy principle, (4) the correctability principle, (5) the representativeness principle, (6) the ethicality principle, and (7) the interactional principle. social exchanges with community (organization) members, leaders can create feelings of obligation, commitment and pro-social behaviors towards the organization (Pearson & Marler, 2010). Transformational leadership, “characterized by offering a purpose that transcends short-term goals and focuses on higher-order intrinsic needs” (Horstmeier et al., 2017, p. 282) enables a collective (organizational) identification.  Whilst the role of transformational leadership has been explored within the context of family firms (Davis, Allan & Hayes, 2010; Eddleston, 2008; Pearson and Marler, 2010), the potential role of leadership in franchise organizations has not been explicitly considered. Although the literature often makes reference to the importance of franchisor-franchisee relationships (Dada & Watson, 2013; Dant, Weaven & Baker, 2013; Pizanti & Lerner, 2003), this literature is largely mute as to exactly who(m) the ‘franchisor’ refers to in this context – i.e., is it the franchisor as an individual founder/leader, or the collective head office management? Particularly in large, established franchise systems, franchisees may have very little direct access to the franchisor (as an individual), but rather their exchanges may be primarily with head office managers, such as area managers. Research by Watson and Johnson (2008) does suggest that leadership can play an important role in developing a sense of shared values and community within franchise organizations. Their case analysis found instances where the (franchise) founder’s charisma had played an important role in developing a sense of family (community) within the franchise system. When this founder left the organization, this negatively impacted the sense of community. Findings by Lawrence and Kaufmann (2011, 2019) also suggest that changes in leadership can have profound effects upon identification. Future research could explore how leadership within the franchise system can promote stewardship behaviors. Pearson and Marler (2010) contend that leaders play an important initiating role in the development of a stewardship-based relationship. In this regard, the motives, or ideology of the franchisor, and senior head-office managers, will be influential. Research could explore the extent to which transformational leadership dimensions are evident and consider how these impact organizational identification and stewardship. Furthermore, the underlying ideology or identities of franchisors and their management team could be considered. Fauchart and Gruber (2011) and Gruber and MacMillan (2017) argue that the social motivation of a founder has implications for their normative beliefs as to what it means to be a successful firm founder. Fauchart and Gruber (2011) find evidence to suggest that the founder’s social identity influences entrepreneurial behaviors, actions and outcomes. Future research could explore how different social identities of the franchise founder influence the leadership styles within the system, and the impact on franchisee stewardship. Indeed, Sieger, Gruber, Fauchart and Zellweger (2016) have developed a social identity scale of entrepreneurs which could be adapted for this purpose. We therefore propose that:  Transformational franchisor leadership will have a positive influence on franchise system community relations. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Our proposed framework contributes to further theory development in the field, and provides guidance for future testing. We have sought to highlight how assumptions of human behavior inform theory and practice. Whilst we have focused our attention on franchise research, such assumptions have important implications not just in the wider entrepreneurship literature, but also business and management more generally (Ghoshal, 2005; Solomon, 1994).  We argue that the traditional perspective of franchisees as mere agents of the franchisor, based on assumptions of Homos Economicus, may not fully capture franchisee motivations. By adopting a communitarian philosophy of human nature, and through our application of stewardship theory, we provide new insights into franchise management approaches and develop a theory of franchisee stewardship. We do not, however, contend that franchise research based on agency theory is not insightful. As Davis et al. (1997) argue, neither theory is inherently superior to the other. Pure agents and pure stewards might not exist but rather, people behave to varying degrees as self-interested (potentially opportunistic) agents and other-interested stewards (Chrisman, 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand the conditions and drivers which lead to agentic or stewardship behaviors. Based on our understanding of what it is to be human, and the framework outlined here, we provide a first step for this research direction. Certainly, much of the agency-based franchise literature has highlighted the need for relational controls to foster trust and reduce the likelihood of opportunistic behaviors (Chiou & Droge, 2015; Kidwell et al., 2007).  Our premise, therefore, is that rather than assuming that franchisees will engage in opportunistic behaviors unless monitored and controlled, we take a less pessimistic view of human nature, and consider that franchisees do not enter the franchise with the intention of exploiting and damaging the brand for personal gain. Indeed, franchisee investments in the system would support this contention. Our argument is in line with Chrisman’s (2019, p. 11–12) suggestion “that most individuals will behave as stewards most of the time”. Thus, the question becomes how best to encourage and maintain pro-organizational behaviors, whilst protecting the uniformity of brand image. In this regard, it is intended that this paper will help provoke debate among franchise scholars, and encourage new avenues of research, guided by our proposed model of franchisee stewardship.  Whilst we have focused our attention on applications to the franchising context, we suggest that this may have implications in other areas of entrepreneurship research. Within the corporate entrepreneurship literature, a number of organizational factors, such as work discretion and supportive organizational structures, have been identified to encourage entrepreneurial behaviors (Hornsby, Kuratko, Shepherd & Bott, 2009). Future research could explore how entrepreneurial behaviors may differ with agentic as opposed to stewardship governance approaches.  TO DO OR TO TEACH?

THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING  IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY ABSTRACT Although franchise and management contracts constitute the dominant growth strategy in the hotel industry (called asset-light and fee-oriented, ALFO), no study has compared them in terms of their relative performance. This paper aims to explain significant differences between them from an organizational and managerial perspective and to assess the impact of this modal choice on hotel online scores.  First, we argue that franchise contracts are less effective than management contracts for operating upscale hotels due to the relative advantages that the latter have in transferring and enforcing tacit knowledge, typically embedded in skilled staff and very relevant in such quality-tier hotels. Second, we argue that franchising is better for large hotels because, on the one hand, its incentive structure better solves managerial shirking\" problems (typically more severe as hotel size increases). On the other hand, franchising also has advantages in situations in which the standardization and normalization of procedures are key to success (as also happens in large establishments). Our empirical findings support broadly these arguments in a dataset of 220 Spanish hotel groups, which also provide evidence that there is no single organizational solution for all situations. Several theoretical and managerial implications are also drawn.Key words: Franchising, management contract, hospitality, knowledge, online scores TO DO OR TO TEACH? THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY INTRODUCTION As has happened with the tourism industry as a whole, the hotel sector has grown significantly in recent decades. For instance, the international tourist arrivals in the world more than doubled during the 21 century. This growth has facilitated hotel firm specialization, driving companies to focus on fewer stages of the supply chain (Stigler, 1951). A clear example of this specialization is the move of the world's leading hotel groups to divest properties (i.e. real estate business) and specialize in hotel operations and brand management (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). This has resulted in the so-called asset-light and fee-oriented (ALFO) growth strategy (Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013, 2014; Li and Singal, 2019). Started by US market leaders such as Marriot and Hilton years ago, this strategy is nowadays a dominant trend in the industry (Mercier, 2020; Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017). It consists in growing by developing brands and business concepts to which they subsequently incorporate affiliated hotels that pay a fee for using those brands and concepts. Consequently, these organizational strategies are heavily based on cooperation agreements of hotel brands with other industry actors (e.g., hotel owners) to obtain the complementary assets needed to offer the lodging services (i.e., those not provided now by the hotel group like the facilities).  This cooperation between firms can be implemented in different ways that constitute the central issue of inter-organizational relationships literature since the organizational choice is key to the success of economic activities (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Williamson,  International tourist arrivals rose worldwide from 686 million in 2000 to 1.461 million in 2019, according to World Tourism Organization (available at: https://webunwto.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2020-01/Barometro-Jan-2020-EN-pre.pdf). We have not taken into account the year 2020 to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic effect which is not relevant in our analysis.  1991). In this sense, several papers have analyzed the influence on different performance measures of, first, the decision to affiliate with a brand or to remain unaffiliated (e.g. Carvell et al. 2016), and then the affiliation choice (e.g. Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosova et al2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Madanoglu and Karadag, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, these studies are substantially biased towards the analysis of franchised vs. owned establishments, probably because of the economic relevance of franchising in retailing and the interest arisen by the franchise contracts among academics (e.g.Combs, Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2004; Dant and Kaufmann, 2003 Lafontaine, 1992; Williamson 1991). Furthermore, they are not conclusive because different results are obtained with different performance measures. While some authors conclude that differences in the relative performance of governance forms are not systematic (e.g., Carvell et al., 2016; Kosová et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Vázquez, Mejía and Sánchez, 2020), others find significant impacts on various key performance indicators, such as prices, occupancy rates, or profitability (e.g. Kalnins, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014). The hotel industry has put into fashion the management contract as an organizational form similar to franchising in developing ALFO strategies (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988).  In the management contract, a hotel group that owns a well-known brand (and the related key assets such as know-how and a reservation system) agrees to use its assets in a hotel (owned by a local partner), assuming, unlike the franchise agreement, the management of this property directly in exchange for a share of the revenues (base fee) and profits (incentive fee). In franchising, the hotel group (franchisor) standardizes the business format and creates the franchise package to transmit the know-how that enables the local partner (franchisee) to replicate the business concept successfully and to run it on its own, in exchange for a franchise fee (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009).  Conversely, in the management contract, the hotel group (the management company) has not to transfer so explicitly its know-how, because its personnel does run the property directly (Ferrary, 2015). In other words, the hotel group has to “teach to manage” in franchising while it has to “manage by itself” the property in a management contract. We argue that this difference between “to do” or “teach to do” is not trivial for hotel management.  Surprisingly, and despite the relevance of management and franchise contracts in the hotel industry −the European average of management contracts and franchises in major hotel chains is 21% and 50% and, in the US, it is 13% and 85% respectively (Collins and Perret, 2015)−, little research has been done on their differences. In fact, different comparisons are observed, but not between these two forms.  Some authors group them into a single category, ALFO strategy, to compare them with ownership and/or rental (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, Izadi, and Olya, 2020; Hua, DeFranco and Abbot, 2020; Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019; Soh, Tan and Jang, 2013 and 2014). Others, more numerous, seek to compare franchising with other organizational forms, ignoring management contracts (e.g., Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015) or grouping them with company-owned establishments in a category called company-operated (e.g., Kosova, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Kosova and Sertsios, 2018) or chain-managed properties (Kalnins, 2017, Zhang et al., 2015). Fernández, González, and López (2021) differentiate all categories but mainly focuses on analyzing hybrids (franchising and management contracts) vs. vertically integrated solutions (ownerships and leasing). Similarly, the literature analyzing international hotel chains expansion also takes organizational forms as separate categories and highlight their differences (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018), but they do not analyze the effect on performance, but the probability of choosing one form depending on host country characteristics and other contextual factors.  This paper aims to compare the performance of franchising and management contracts, studying whether there are systematic differences in the characteristics of the hotels in which one formula outperforms another. Although our main argument is that no governance mode is universally superior to others for promoting performance, we hypothesize that franchising and management contracts differ in terms of assets allocation and control, which yield two effects. The first is related to how the managed/franchisee firms access the knowledge needed to run the hotel according to brand standards and routings (i.e., knowledge transfer problem). The second effect is linked to the capacity of both types of contracts in preventing misbehaviors and managerial shirking at the local level. We maintain that management contracts outperform franchising for transferring tacitknowledge because it works better “to do” than “to teach to do”, especially when tacit know-how is relevant. On the other hand, we support that franchising outperforms management contracts when shirking and the need for routinization are significant issues. Our performance variable is online scores, a key performance indicator in the tourism industry (e.g., Sainaghi et al., 2017; 2019).   This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, comparisons of aggregated conceptual categories, usually hybrid forms versus more integrated hotels, have been the standard so far in the literature on inter-organizational relations and organizational economics (. Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosova, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Michael, 2000 and 2002). But this presents the problem of grouping substantially different organizational forms in a single category and the subjectivity of deciding how to group these hybrid forms.  Our contribution is to fine-tune the analysis since nowadays, with the predominance of ALFO strategies, the real choice of hotel groups is franchising or management contracts. Second, we contribute to the literature on organizational fit because our results show that management contracts fit better in upscale hotels, where the business requires more tacit knowledge, suggesting that the transmission of know-how is more effective within the organization than between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al. 2008; Shaw and Williams, 2009). This highlights a franchise weakness: the transfer of this type of knowledge when it is key for succeeding (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). Similarly, we show that franchise moderates the negative size effect on performance (Kosová and Sertsios, 2018). This suggests that its higher standardization capabilities, combined with its higher-powered incentives, make the franchise a better organizational form than management contracts in large hotels. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Inter-organizational relationships literature has highlighted the existence of a wide variety of contractual solutions to facilitate inter-firm cooperation and thus gather the specialized assets needed to produce an economic activity (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Williamson, 1991).  The hotel sector is a canonical example of this diversity, as hotel firms offer lodging services in establishments operated under very diverse contracts among real-estate and hotel proprietors (Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dahlstrom et al. 2009; León, Villar, and Pla, 2011; Li and Singal, 2019). In this context, franchise and management contracts stand out as prevalent governance solutions used by large hotel groups to achieve rapid expansion in the industry (Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017; Collins and Perret, 2015; 2019; Mercier, 2020). Both types of contracts have significant similarities that have led them to be jointly analysed in the hospitality literature. In a franchise agreement, the franchisor (brand owner) owns a business concept and grants the right to operate it to the franchisee (hotel owner) for a period in exchange for a franchise fee (Brickley and Dark 1987; Rubin, 1978). On the other hand, in a management contract, the hotel owner (managed company) hires a management company as an agent to operate the hotel business on its behalf, in exchange for a management fee and using the management company's business concept (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988). A key common feature of these two types of contracts is that the ownership of the business format (held by a hotel group) is separate from the hotel ownership/property (held by the franchisee/managed firm) (Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Melissen, van Ginneken, and Wood, 2016). Therefore, both partners must ally to exploit their co-specialized assets and provide the service. One partner (i.e., the franchisor/management company) provides the brand name and the method of doing business according to a proven business system. The other partner (i.e., franchisee/managed firm) contributes all local physical assets (facilities, furniture, fixture, and equipment) and is entitled to the hotel’s residual income. Thus, in the words of the Transaction Cost Economics literature (Williamson, 1991), both franchise and management agreements generate a hybrid form of governance that contrasts with independent or chain-owned hotels (where hotel proprietors operate them under their own brands). This shared feature of franchise and management contracts have led them to be considered equally valuable instruments for hotel groups' adoption of the so-called ALFO strategy. This strategy involves reducing real estate ownership at stake and basing revenue generation on fees charged to owners of the property (Li and Singal 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014). Precisely, through franchise and management contracts, hotel groups can grow and leverage their intangible strategic assets (e.g., brand equity, business know-how, and reservation systems) without making large capital investments; while basing their revenues on the collection of franchise and management fees The franchise fee follows a non-linear payment schedule, with a fixed initial fee plus variable continuing fees (e.g., royalty fee, advertising or marketing fee, reservation fee, loyalty fee). The continuing fees can be tied to the gross sales revenue or the number of rooms (Collins and Perret, 2019; Mathewson and Winter, 1985). On the other hand, the management fee is subdivided into a base fee and an incentive fee. The base fee can be an agreed fixed amount or a percentage of revenues or profits. The incentive fee depends on the achievement of a certain predefined profit level and is usually linked to the Gross Operating Profit (for the operator to monitor the operating expenses of the property). Thus, the incentive fee shifts financial risk from the managed company to a risk-sharing arrangement with the management company (Hua, DeFranco, and Abbott, 2020). Among the main advantages attributed to the ALFO strategy, the hospitality literature has highlighted its ability to reduce financial risks for hotel chains (Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014) and to expand the hotel business, leveraging hotel intangible assets efficiently, without huge capital investment (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002). However, although recent research does seem to confirm the risk advantages of this strategy (e.g., Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013; 2014), the evidence on its ability to improve hotel chains' performance, as measured by different financial ratios, is mixed. While some studies find a positive effect on performance (e.g., Sohn et al., 2013; Seo and Soh, 2019; Hua, DeFranco, and Abbot, 2020), other studies find only negligible differences (Bourke, Izadi, and Olia, 2020) or, even, no difference in performance between asset-light and asset-based (i.e., with significant ownership or leased property stakes) hotel groups. The lack of a clear positive effect of ALFO strategy on firms’ performance may be due, in part, to the financial difficulties caused by the decrease in the tangibility of assets (e.g., financial distress, and with it financial costs, may increase as safety brought by fixed asset collaterals lowers) (Brealey and Myers, 2002). In addition to this financial drawbacks, according to agency theory arguments (Eisenhardt, 1989), the separation of hotel (i.e., real state) ownership from its strategic intangible assets (i.e., brand name and know-how) may also lead to significant conflicts of interest, with negative consequences for the hotel group and its brand equity (Brickley and Dark, 1987; Rivas, et al. 2013; Rubin, 1978).  On the one hand, the franchisee and the managed company as residual claimants of their establishments directly receive the result of their management efforts, which usually makes them well-motivated local managers compared to hired directors of company-owned hotels (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017). However, the transfer of ownership that accompanies an ALFO strategy also implies the loss of control over hotel properties, which can cause serious inconsistencies in the quality and operations of the hotel group, impairing its ability to ensure quality consistency in their establishments (e.g.,Brookes, Altinay and Aktas, 2015; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018; Michael, 2000, 2002; Sun, Park and He; 2019). Ultimately this would result in worse service and lower customer satisfaction in franchise and managed hotels, challenging the brand performance in the medium and long term. Therefore, the effectiveness of ALFO strategies will depend on a complex balance between their financial risk implications and the severity of conflicts linked to their unique ownership structure. This study focuses on the latter, i.e., inter-firm conflicts, to analyze more in deep the comparative advantages of the two prevailing asset-light models, i.e., franchising and management contracts. Comparative effectivess of franchising vs. management contracts in ALFO strategies The success of the ALFO strategy as a preferred form of expansion may lead to the mistaken assumption that it fits, in terms of performance, all organizations in the hospitality industry (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). However, its effectiveness also depends on where and  it applies. In this regard, recent studies highlight that its benefits/drawbacks do not necessarily have to be uniform across companies or even over time. They may be contingent on factors such as the economic cycle (Sohn et al., 2014), the sector and segment in which hotels operate (Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019), or the resources and organizational skills of the chains (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). Moreover, the effectiveness of the ALFO strategy may also depend on the contractual forms that support it, i.e., franchise vs. management contracts. On this point, the inter-organizational literature has proposed that there is no universally superior organizational form (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Wiliamson, 1991). Rather, the distinctive characteristics of each organizational form make them better suited to respond to particular problems.  Yet, most studies have overlooked the comparative analysis of franchise vs. management contracts and their differential effects on hotel performance (Kruesi et al., 2018). In fact, extant research on the impact of ALFO strategies on firms’ performance has ignored this issue; regarding both contracts as a single or equivalent governance form (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, et al., 2020; Hua, et al., 2020; Seo and Soh, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013). Therefore, it is necessary a closer examination of the differences between these alternative models. Despite their aforementioned similarities, franchise and management contracts have meaningful differences in their governance structure that can alter the type and severity of conflicts between brands and proprietors and, thus, the performance of hotel firms. Contractor and Kundu (1998) recognize that the main differencelies in the degree of control over strategic business assets e.g., brand name, global reservation system, and business know-how embedded in routines and daily operations). This is because in a management contract the hotel brand retains the responsibility for directing and managing the establishment's operations. That is, the hotel brand appoints one of its own managers to run the local hotel directly, usually in collaboration with other local managers who are hired by the managed company (Brooks and Roper, 2010; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Kruesi et al., 2018; Melissen et al., 2016). Consequently, the owner of the business's strategic intangible assets (the hotel brand) has a substantial influence on most of the daily decisions of the local hotel affecting its value. In contrast, under a franchise contract, the franchisor firm has lower control over those intangible assets. This is because it has delegated day-to-day management over assets in the franchisee and none of the franchisor representatives is present daily at the local level (i.e., in the franchisee's establishments). Clearly, the franchisee has to abide by the contract and the operations manual, but he or she interprets by himself/herself how to operate the hotel establishment.  Another key distinguising feature is that the management contract is the one that entails the clearest separation between the operation of the hotel and its ownershipi.e., ownership over real state and residual income) (Melissen et al., 2016). In franchised hotels, the person who operates the establishment (franchisee) is the same person who receives the residual income from the business; however, in managed hotels, the operator (management company) is not the residual claimant.  These differences in terms of assets allocation and control can alter the ability to transfer knowledge and prevent opportunistic behaviors within the hotel chain. In this regard, our main argument is that no mechanism of governance (i.e., franchised or managed hotels) is universally superior to other, rather the effectiveness of a particular mechanism will depend on the specific context in which it is deployed. Thus, distinctive characteristics of the service provision will determine knowledge transfer requirements and main agency problems faced by hotels and then the governance form best suited to respond to them. In hypothesis form:H1. The impact of governance mode (franchise vs management contract) on hotel performance is not direct but contingent on the hotel characteristics. Management contract advantages in (tacit) knowledge transfer  Compared to management contracts franchising do require transferring the business knowledge (of the franchisor) to the franchisee, because he or she is running by himself/herself the property and needs to learn how to do it. This means that it is necessary to transfer knowledge between independent companies. Conversely, management contracts do not require any explicit transfer of knowledge because the general manager who is in charge of applying such know-how and operates the establishment has already acquired it (i.e., he or she is an employee of the management company). Consequently, here the transfer of knowledge is within the management company and among its employees (Ferrary, 2015). In this regard, organizational literature argues that the transfer of knowledge within an organization is less challenging than between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al., 2008; Shaw and Williams, 2009), which would give a potential advantage for management contracts.  In the franchise context, the franchisor has the legal obligation of transferring its own know-how to the franchisee, since it is assumed that such proprietary and distinctive knowledge is essential for the success of the franchise business (Real Decreto 210/2010). Furthermore, such knowledge is articulated into the business practicese.g., Combs and Ketchen, 1999; Barthélemy, 2008) that are subsequently conveyed to the franchisee through the contract and the operation manuals, the initial training, and the day-to-day assistance (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009).  This set of codified knowledge (i.e., franchise manuals and contracts) constitute franchisors’ main repository of knowledge (Solís and González, 2019). Conversely, in the management contract, the management company specializes in supplying its employees to the affiliated hotels. It focuses on recruiting, training, and managing qualified staff (i.e., general managers and experts responsible for specialized departments) and then assigning them to the chain’s establishments. The managed firm (i.e., hotel owner) hires the remaining line employees and focuses on the real estate dimension of the business (Ferrary, 2015). Therefore, the main repository of knowledge is not the manuals as in franchising, but the skilled staff of the hotel group, so that the strategic know-how needed to operate the business keeps in-houseFurthermore, compared to the knowledge acquired by independent franchisees, managerial know-how in management contracts is more likely to be of a tacit (non-codifiable) nature because knowledge acquisition is based on internal training, internships, and daily experiences within the  This is the case of the Spanish legal system, but similar obligations apply in other countries. chain. Internal knowledge transfer facilitates the informal links, communication, and learning by doing that is needed to develop and absorb tacit knowledge (Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). Instead, because tacit knowledge cannot be fully articulated in electronic databases or manuals (e.g.franchise operations manuals), passing on tacit business practices to independent franchisees can be particularly costly or imprecise (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2004; Paswan and Wittman, 2009).  In sum, when hotel groups need to transfer highly tacit business know-how, they should benefit more from management contracts. The category of the hotel might determine the tacitness of the knowledge to be transferred. Upscale and luxury hotels are knowledge-intensive companies and most of this know-how is more tacit and complex in nature (non-codifiable) than that of lower-category hotels (Chen and Dimou, 2005; Ferrary, 2015; León et al., 2011). Upscale hotels are also more difficult to monitor than lower-category ones. This is because it is very costly to explain and to exactly define in advance how to deliver high-value services, and thus to design reliable, internal measures for assessing them. In fact, Ehbauer and Gresel (2013) note that luxury retail is still deﬁcient in holistic performance measurement and management tools, because it is difficult to develop a framework that includes quantitative as well as qualitative key performance indicators for the efﬁcient management of luxury stores.  Therefore, in upscale or luxury hotels in which we need to transfer more tacit knowledge, the typical knowledge transfer between companies that the franchise demands, and its subsequent articulation in manuals or documents, is less effective than the transfer of knowledge within the company (i.e., based on the employees) typical of management contracts. In other words, it is easier “to do it” than “to teach how to do it”. This difficulty may result in the inability to ensure adequate compliance with brand quality standards in high-end franchised hotels. Ultimately, this will result in poorer service and lower customer satisfaction (i.e., lesser online scores) for franchised hotels compared to managed ones. Thus: H2. The interaction of franchise (vs management) contracts and hotel category has a negative effect on online scores. Franchising advantages in preventing shirking and foster standardization  The governance differences between franchising and management contracts also affect the severity of the different types of opportunism that may occur at the establishment level. First, a relevant problem in any network of geographically dispersed establishments is to prevent shirking in the effort of the local manager (Rubin, 1978). Both contracts provide a useful tool to reduce this problem because managed firms and franchisees assume the economic consequences of their decisions due to their residual claimant status on the hotel property.  However, management contracts solve probably worse this problem than franchise contracts. Unlike franchisees, the general managers of managed hotels have no residual claim on the profits of the establishments they manage because they are employees of the management company. This condition provides them with less powerful incentives to perform (e.g., to supervise hotel employees and operations closely) (Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017).  Hotel management companies monitor their behavior and introduce incentive system that aligns management company’ and general manager’ interests, like pay-for-performance programs (e.g., profit or sales commissions). However, such solutions cannot equal the incentive intensity created by the residual claims on hotel  The residual claimant status is only partially internalized by the chain in managed and franchised hotels through the collection of management and franchise fees. These fees are mainly linked to number of rooms or revenues per room (ranging 1-5%) in franchising (Collins and Perret, 2019), and mainly linked to gross operating revenue (ranging 2-4%) or operating profit (under 15%) in management contracts (Balyozyan et al., 2017).  profits of the franchisee (including the right to transfer the position of the residual claimant) (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972).  Second, high-powered incentives based on residual claimancy acentuate the free-riding problem. Franchisees and managed hotels can use their leeway to free-ride on the brand equity and maximize the profits at local level at the expense of the whole branded-hotel group interests. This theoretical problem translates into different misbehaviours that have been largely studied, both in franchise (Brickley and Dark, 1987; El Akremi et al., 2011; Kidwell et al., 2007) and in management contracts (van Ginneken et al., 2019; Schlup, 2004; Turner and Guilding, 2010).   There are also differences in how free-riding is solved under both types of governance forms. We argue that management contracts reduce easier the free-riding problem than franchising because the former has an advantage over the latter in terms of supervision and monitoring.  The general manager of the managed hotel, i.e. an employee of the hotel management company, holds much better position to monitor and to prevent any opportunist behavior within the hotel he/she runs (the managed company) than the auditors, external supervisors or mystery shoppers that the franchisor could set in to control the franchisee behavior. In sum, management contracts solve the problem of free riding on brand equity better than the franchise contracts but worse the problem of managers’ shirking. The hotel size is a feature that probably affects more the severity of the shirking problem than that of the free riding. The reason is that we are referring to the size of a property, not the size of the network that could affect the free-riding of shared assets. In this case, the number of rooms or guests affects the effort that the hotel general manager has to make (related to shirking), and not the use of shared assets (related to free riding). Large hotels demand greater efforts from staff and management team than small hotels because mistakes are more harmful in the former than in the latter.  A management error in a large hotel can be extremely costly because of the number of employees, assets and guests involved.  They require more planning than smaller hotels because, due to the size of their operations, nothing can be left to chance (i.e. their responsiveness capacity is very limited) (Hodari and Sturman, 2014).   In this line of reasoning, Kosová and Sertsios (2018) found that franchised hotels far away from their franchisor’s headquarters are larger and generate higher revenues. They run a similar analysis for company-managed hotels that showed they were not significantly greater. The revenue premium in franchised hotels is largely explained by the size specified by the franchisor when the hotel starts its operations. It means that up-front investment requirements (higher in larger hotels) are utilized in self-enforcing and denote a positive relationship between the use of franchise and hotel size. Consequently, it seems likely that the franchising should offer better results in large hotels than management contracts.  Furthermore, large hotels require more normalization of procedures than the smaller because other coordination mechanisms (e.g. mutual adaptation or direct supervision) are not effective in this type of organizations (machine bureaucracy in terms of Mintzberg, 1979) (Baker and Cullen, 1993; Sutton and Dobbin, 1996).  Franchising has an advantage in working under normalized environments compared with management contracts because the franchisee is used to employ routines. Franchise businesses demand to develop a set of formal and routine procedures to transfer their explicit knowledge and practices to franchisees (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). The potential cognitive, cultural and/or interest distance with their franchisee partners, together with the impossibility of resorting to hierarchical authority to oversee their behaviours, means that they have to develop routine procedures, rules and policies (contained, for example, in the franchise manuals) to guide the cooperation between the partners (Knott, 2003; Winter, Szulanski, Ringov, and Jensen, 2012).  In fact, the ability to create \"standard operating routines\" to communicate and transfer them to their franchisees is considered a key alliance capability in franchise chains (Gillis et al. 2020). Moreover, we expect this \"alliance management capability\" to represent a differential advantage of the franchise agreement to ensure coordination and standardization in contexts where it poses more problems, such as in large hotels. In sum, it can be expected that: H3. The interaction of franchise (vs. management) contracts and hotel size has a positive effect on online scores.EMPIRICAL SETTING  The above hypotheses were tested on a dataset of establishments belonging to the 250 largest hotel groups operating in Spain in 2018. These hotel groups were running 3,105 establishments (505,752 rooms) in Spain at the beginning of 2018, out of a population composed of 3,887 hotels belonging to hotel groups (Nota, 2018).  These figures do not take into account independent hotels and they were not considered in the empirical analysis because the aim of the paper forces us to focus only on hotel chains (i.e. independent hotels are always company-owned hotels so that we do not observe variability in terms of organizational forms).  The Spanish hotel industry is an appropriate setting because it is a leading country in the tourism industry – ranking second worldwide, in 2018, for both receipts and international tourist arrivals (World Tourism Organization, 2019; p. 9) – and has a mature hotel sector. We have focussed on hotels from one single country, Spain, to control for the influence on the choice of governance form of the country and its institutions (e.g., sector organization, regulation and economic and political stability) (Lafontaine et al., 2017).  This also avoids the potential bias that country-specific features may cause on online reviews (Radojevic ., 2017). Information about the establishment features (category, size, location, restaurants, opening date, hotel group and governance form) was obtained from the Directory of hotels and apartments in Spain of Alimarket (www.Alimarket.es), the leading provider of sectorial economic information in Spain. Given our interest in comparing franchising and management contracts (using chain-owned hotels as a control group), we restricted the dataset in the following way. First, we did not consider leased hotels because we did not want to contaminate our control group with other organizational forms in which different conflicts of interest might exist (. real estate owner and the hotel group). Second, we also ruled out those establishments that their business concept was not the canonical example of hotel accommodation so that they could introduce noise in estimations. Then, we rejected apartments, focusing only on hotels and aparthotels, because core services differ significantly between them (e.g. meals, bedmaking, cleaning, etc.). Similarly, we rejected minor types such as hostels, rural tourism establishments, and holiday villages. In sum, after rejecting also those hotels for which we do not have information for all the variables, our final dataset was 1,664 hotels belonging to 220 hotel groups. 3.1 Variables The dependent variable is Score, which is the weighted mean of three website scores for each hotel after homogenizing their scales. We took these scores from Booking, Expedia, andTripAdvisor websites between March and June 2018. The weighting variable was the number of comments used to compute each website score. Such tourist websites have become an increasingly important source of information for academic studies on the hotel sector turning online reviews into a key performance indicator (Kwok et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018) and a potential source of revenues because many guests consult them before booking a room (Cantallops and Salvi, 2014). We use two different dichotomous variables to identify the status of hotel in its group. The variable Franchising takes value “1” when the chain operates a hotel through a franchise contract and “0” otherwise.  Similarly, the variable Management takes value “1” when the hotel group operates the lodging establishment through a management contract. This variable is a predictor in score estimations, but is also used as a dependent variable in an auxiliary regression because of methodological requirements. Upscale is a dummy variable that takes value “1” if hotel has more than three stars and “0” otherwise Spanish hotel classification system ranges from one to five stars. We have considered that establishments with less than four stars are different types of economy hotels. Conversely, upscale full-service hotels are those classified as 4 and 5-star hotels. They offer larger rooms and more additional services are available, especially in the 5-star hotels. These offer the most sophisticated service and the most well-appointed facilities. The variable LRooms measures the size of the hotel as the natural logarithm of its number of rooms. Renewal refers to the number of years since the hotel facility was built or renovated, and is used as a proxy of the hotel’s maintenance requirements. Restaurants is a control variable, which refers to the number of restaurants. Hotel group-z are dummy variables constructed for each of the =1, …, 220) hotel groups included in the study. The list of hotel groups has been extracted from Informe de Grupos Hoteleros en España 2018 (Nota, 2018). They aim to control for possible chain effects, such as their corporate strategy or their preferences in terms of governance forms (i.e., brands may specialize in different governance solutions). Finally, we used two variables as the main instruments to control for self-selection bias in governance form choices (this will be further discussed in the estimation section below). The first variable, Geographic concentration, measures the number of hotels belonging to the same hotel group in the same province. The second variable, Ratio of j-form hotels, measures, for each hotel , the ratio of hotels that its chain maintains in the same province with the organizational form over the total number of hotels belonging to the same chain and in the same province as hotel Table 1 summarizes the variables,  Table2 shows their descriptive statistics, and Table 3 displays the number of hotels in the dataset per governance form and category. -------------------------- TABLE 1 ------------------------------------- -------------------------- TABLE 2 ------------------------------------- -------------------------- TABLE 3 ------------------------------------- 3.2 Estimation An important concern in evaluating the effect of organizational form choice on performance is sample selection bias. This is a recurrent problem in similar studies (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Mesquita and Brush, 2008) and several authors have emphasized the relevance of controlling for it because organizational form choices are likely to be chosen systematically, not randomly (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Shaver, 1998). Hotel group managers may self-select into different governance forms (i.e. types of affiliated hotels). In other words, they could make their decision based on which option they expect to be more profitable for the hotel group in the future. This implies that a simple OLS of performance (Score) as a function of governance form leads to biased estimates (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Mayer and Nickerson, 2005).  The suggested method of correction and testing is based on Heckman (1979). This consists in running a two equations model in which the first equation is a “treatment” model to describe the self-selection decision. The second equation, the performance regression in our case, is then estimated to be adjusted for self-selection from the first equation. Maddala (1983: 120-122) and the Stata reference manual (v.14, p. 59-64) show the two-stage estimator of this model. In our case, we estimate a probit model of the treatment equation that was specified as follows: Franchising/ManagementUpscale*LRooms + Renewal +Restaurants +  Geographic concentration + Ratio of franchised hotels + Ratio of managed hotels + Ratio of chain-owned hotels + Hotel group 1 +…+Hotel group 220 + ε                             [Eq. 1]Where is a random error term and Franchising/Management are unobservable measures of the organizational form. However, we observe the chosen contract, a dichotomous variable, Franchisng/Management, with Franchising/Management= 0 if Franchising/Management and Franchising/Management= 1 if  Franchising/ManagementThe second stage analyses scores conditioned by the choice of the governance form and other hotel features as follows: Score =   β*Upscale + β*LRooms + β*Renewal + β*Restaurants + βFranchising/Management + β*Franchising/Management *Upscale+ β*Franchising/Management *LRooms+ β*Franchising/Management*Renewal + β*Hotel group 1 +…+ β*Hotel group 220 + *Mills_Ratio + ε                                                                                                                                                             [Eqs. 2]It is important to note that we have to econometrically identify Equation (1). This means that we need to introduce at least one instrument in the treatment regression (first stage) which is not considered in the performance regression (second stage). Specifically, we use Geographic concentration and Ratio of franchised/managed/chain-owned hotels as instruments for the endogenous variables (Franchising/Management). Applying a similar argument to Kosová et al.(2013), we expect that the latter, i.e., the proportion of chain hotels in a region with a particular governance form is inversely related to the unit cost of monitoring this type of establishment. From this point of view, this proportion reflects the unobserved costs of selecting a governance form within a particular region. Moreover, from a monitoring perspective, there may be scale economies at local level from developing and using the management devices needed to monitor each type of governance mode (Dahlstrom et al., 2009; Hoffman and Preble, 2003; Shane, 1996). Therefore, as the ratio of j-form hotels grows in a region, its cost relative to alternative governance forms will decrease in that area, thus increasing the probability that it will be chosen. As for the former variable, Geographic concentration of chain establishments in the province, this allows us to control for the chain size and, thus, to weight the scale economies approximated by the ratio of j-form hotels. On the other hand, these concentration measures should not directly affect online scores, which mainly depends on the service actually experienced in each particular hotel. In fact, customers are not aware of either the governance mode of each hotel or the number of establishments belonging to the hotel group in the same province. 3.3 Results The Table 4 shows main results since they reflect the performance comparison of hotels operated under franchise and management contracts. Although our interest is in the second stage, it also shows first-stage results for their methodological value (Appendix 1 summarizes descriptive statistics for two-stage estimations).  In this sense, these resultssuggest that Heckman's correction is not needed. The coefficients of the Hazard, which is the parameter that Stata uses to estimate i.e. the correlation between the error terms of equations [1] and [2]), is not significantly different from cero. We cannot then reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between these error terms and, then, the equations can be considered independent because bias selection is statistically insignificant. Furthermore, some of our instruments are statistically significant (Ratio of franchised/managed are significant and have the expected effect on the organizational form), what suggests that they fulfill the requirement that they should be correlated with the choice of organizational form so they can identify the equation [1].   Regarding the second-stage, we have estimated a baseline model with the direct effects and an augmented model in which we also consider interactive effects of the organizational form and the features of the hotels. Results of the baseline models in Table 4 indicate, first, that scores of hotels positively depend on their category and on the number of restaurants and negatively on the size of the hotel (in terms of rooms) and on the renewal date of facilities.  However, Franchisingcoefficient is not statistically significant, suggesting that none of these organizational forms is better on average in terms of scores. This is an expected result because it broadly supports the idea that there is no universally superior organizational form that works for all types of hotels (when it comes to improving their performance) (hypothesis 1).   Second, the augmented model results reflect two important findings. On the one hand, we observe that when hotel groups decide to operate upscale hotels under franchise contracts, the expected performance in terms of score is reduced (6F-M= -0.3475 p < 0.01) in comparison with those upscale hotels run under management contracts. Consequently, it seems that franchising is the worst solution for higher-category hotels, as proposed in hypothesis H2. On the other hand, franchising positively moderates the negative effect of hotel size on score. As expected in H3, we obtain a positive and significant parameter for the interactive effect in Table  (7F-M= 0.1812 p < 0.05). This means that, for large hotels, franchising is more effective than management contracts i.e., it mitigates the drawbacks of size in scores).  Please, note that these two variables do not need to sum up to 1 because we have considered in the ratios calculation the four types of organizational forms that exist. Consequently, they can be considered simultaneously in the regression. -------------------------- TABLE 4 ------------------------------------- As a robustness check, we also present the results of comparing the performance of franchised and managed hotels with company-owned hotels respectively (Table 5). The aim of adding this comparison is twofold. First, it facilitates to compare our results with extant literature and, second, helps check the soundness of hypotheses if they can also predict the differences of these new comparisons. Panel A compares franchised and chain-owned establishments (the dependent variables in the first stage is Franchising) and Panel B considers hotels operated under management contracts and chain-owned hotels (the dependent variable in the first stage is Management).  Results corroborate our previous main findings. First, Panel A in Table 5 (augmented model) shows that the choice of franchising also reduces the positive effect of Upscale on the expected score when compared with chain-owned hotels (6F-O= -0.3388 p < 0.01) meanwhile Panel B in Table 5 (augmented model) shows that managed hotels are not statistically different in terms of scores from company-owned hotels for operating upscale establishments. Both results are consistent with H2 that argues that franchising is the less appropriate organizational form to operate upscale hotels. Second, the parameter of Franchising x Lrooms is also positive and significant in the augmented model of Panel A in Table 5 (7F-O= 0.1631 p < 0.1), but it is not statistically significant the estimate of Management x Lrooms (Panel B in Table 5).which again are both coherent with H3. Finally, Management coefficient in Panel B in Table 5 (i.e., managed vs owned hotels) is significant and negative (5M-O= - 0.1122 p < 0.05), which suggests, contrary to H1, that management contracts are worse in terms of scores than the company-owned hotels, irrespective of the characteristics of the hotels. -------------------------- TABLE 5 ------------------------------------- To reinforce the above results about H2 and H3, we plotted the interaction effects, as shown in Figure 1Franchisors’ Communication of Risk and ReturnAreej Saad Alshamrani Ph.D. Candidate Department of Marketing Monash Business School | Monash University Caulfield, VIC 3145 AUSTRALIA  Email:  Areej.Alshamrani@monash.eduSudha Mani Senior Lecturer Department of Marketing Monash Business School | Monash University Caulfield, VIC 3145 AUSTRALIA Telephone: 03 9903 1592 Email: sudha.mani@monash.edu Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School May, 2021 Franchisors’ Communication of Risk and ReturnAbstract Adding new franchised outlets is critical for franchisors. Yet, little is known of how franchisors’ strategic use of communication can improve the number of new franchised outlets. Prior work on the strategic use of communications has identified that large franchisors communicate on the identity of the franchise system. However, little insight exists on the influence of communication of risk and returns. Understanding the communication of risk are return is vital as entrepreneurs seek to invest in franchising over independent businesses to increase returns and reduce risk. Thus, this study aims to investigate the influence of franchisors’ communication on risk and return is associated with new franchised outlets. We develop a custom database of 133 US-based franchises, we content analyzed item 1 of the Franchise Disclosure Documents to test how the communication of risk and return by the franchisors affect new franchised outlets. The findings show that risk significantly influences the number of new franchised outlets and that franchise age significantly moderates the effect of the communication of risk. However, we find no such influence of the communication of returns.  Key words: Franchising, Risk, Return, Communications INTRODUCTION In 2017, there were approximately 733 thousand franchise units in the United States contributing around 7.6 million direct jobs in U.S franchises and about $404.6 billion direct contributions to gross domestic product (The Franchise Handbook, 2017). In Australia, franchising is even bigger with three more franchising outlets per capita than the United States and more franchise outlets per capita than any other country in the world (Franchising Top Markets Report, 2016). These Australian franchises employ nearly 600,000 people (IBISWorld, 2019).    For a thriving franchising sector, adding new franchised outlets to a system is critical to franchisors to increase profitability, for achieving economies of scale, and to penetrate new markets. It is not surprising that in a 2012 survey sponsored by the Franchise Council of Australia, 77% of franchisors reported that recruiting new franchisees was one of the challenges for franchisors (Frazer, Weaven, & Bodey, 2012). In addition, the survey revealed that on average, franchisors spent $20,000 in the financial year 2010/2011 on advertising activities to recruit franchisees (Frazer et al., 2012).  Franchisors spend significant resources on recruiting new franchisees. Studies show that entrepreneurs decide to enter franchising and becoming franchisees long before choosing a specific franchise industry or brand (Kaufmann, 1999). This means that many potential franchisees have no specific preferences and will investigate the many options available to them before choosing the right franchisor. However, prior work has mostly focused on why franchisees select franchising as a business format (Kaufmann & Stanworth, 1995; Peterson & Dant, 1990). However, little attention has been paid to the franchisors’ efforts to attract franchisees into the system.  The one notable exception is Zachary et al. (2011) assesses franchise branding by examining the corporate websites of franchisors. The authors studied how franchisors communicate on their corporate websites to attract potential franchisees, including how they represent aspects of organizational identity – that market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and charismatic leadership. They find that firm size affects the rhetoric used in communicating with franchisees (Zachary et al., 2011). Similar to Zachary et al., this study also examines the role of rhetoric used in communicating with franchisees – especially how franchisors communicate on risk and return. Specifically, “the strategic use of words to persuade potential franchisees of the value of the franchisor’s opportunity” (Zachary et al., 2011; p. 630) will affect the number of new franchised outlets.            This study makes three distinct contributions to the literature and builds on Zachary et al.’s work (2011). First, in this study, we examine how the communication of risk and return affect the number of new franchised outlets. By doing so, the first contribution of this study is how franchises can grow through the strategic use of words to persuade franchisees. Mani, Wathne, and Antia (2016), in their review of emerging trends in franchising research from 2005 to 2014, advocate that more attention should be given to studying franchise system growth and acknowledge that it has received the least attention in franchising research. The second contribution of this study is to understand the role of the communication of risk and return and its effect on franchisor growth (new franchised outlets). Prior studies only looked at the trade-offs of risk and return for the franchisors. A paper by Martin (1988), for example, studied the risks and returns that are associated with a franchisor’s option of franchising as opposed to company-owned outlets. Another example is Brickley and Dark’s (1987) paper that discusses the risks and incentives for franchisors’ decisions of franchising some units and owning others by considering agency-related problems. Additional studies examined how risk influences franchisors’ decisions on fee structure (Lafontaine, 1992; Sen 1993). With respect to franchisees, Williams (1999) investigated the risk and return for entrepreneurs and evaluated the choice between franchising or being an independent owner. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research that has examined the communication of risk and return. In addition to the direct effect of the communication of risk and return, we also examine the moderating role of franchise age. Thus, the third contribution of this study is to explain the role of franchise age. The age of an organization may be perceived negatively or positively. For example, older franchises are associated with obsolescence and inertia, creating a negative perception of age. While, positive perceptions of franchise age are because of greater organizational learning, stability, and reputation of franchises. This study will also assess the extent to which franchise age moderates the relationship between the communication of risk/return and the opening of new franchised outlets.          The research data for this study was collected from 133 franchises in the United States. Two consecutive years’ Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDS; 266) for these franchises were obtained from state regulatory authority in the United States. We used text analysis tools to content analyze item 1 of the FDD and examined the influence of communication of risk and return and age on the opening of new franchised outlets.           The rest of this paper is organized as follows. A discussion of the literature review on franchise age and the hypotheses are presented. We then discuss the data, method, and results. Finally, the paper is concluded with theoretical and managerial implications of this research. LITERATURE REVIEW  Franchise Age There are many inferences that potential franchisees can make about a franchise’s age when deciding whether or not to buy a franchise. On the one hand, it has been argued that age indicates value for the potential franchisee because of the likelihood of survival and the success of older franchises (Baucus et al. 1993). In addition, when the environment remains stable, organizations improve their competence, becoming more efficient, and learn from experiences (Sørensen & Stuart, 2000). Franchisors also use their reputation to signal the value of the business (Shane, Shankar, & Aravidakshan, 2006), which is mostly acquired as the franchise grows older. It is indeed recognized that franchisees will mostly invest in a reliable franchise that is a proven business idea, having survived the first few years, and that is already established with profitable franchised or company-owned outlets successfully running.            On the other hand, as age increases, franchisees consider other factors related to a franchise’s age and life cycle. Potential franchisees might view older franchise systems negatively for several reasons. One theory argues that inertia is the negative influence of an organization’s age on its structures and practices, especially when facing external or environmental threats or uncertainties. Structural inertia, which increases monotonically with age, is an organization’s inability to perform internal changes in light of significant external changes (Hannan & Freeman, 1977, 1984). An incumbent firm may not be adaptable due to its inertia. In a dynamic market, a business needs to be agile and flexible to environmental or technological changes. It needs to be able to change its routines to cope and deal with risks and uncertainties and to seize opportunities. This is more difficult for older franchises because of rigidity in organizational routines.        Moreover, by closely examining franchising literature, there are also studies on ownership redirection, which show that successful franchised outlets are acquired by the franchisor as the franchise ages. Ownership redirection is based on resource dependence (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) and resource–scarcity theories. Many franchisors start franchising because of their need for informational, managerial, and financial resources (Dant & Kaufmann, 2003). Franchisees have local market knowledge that franchisors need in order to expand. Also, the several fees and royalties that franchisees pay provide financial resources to the franchisors. Thus, the longer the franchise has been doing business, the more established they become, and the more that they accumulate (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1968). Consequently, franchisors become less reliant and dependent on franchisees and their resources. According to ownership redirection theory, which was first proposed by Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1968), it is more likely for successful franchised units to be acquired by the franchisor or that the franchisor will shift to a bigger proportion of company-owned outlets. Carney and Gedajlovic (1991) argue that as the franchise grows over time, franchisors learn the potential of individual units in terms of sales and profit, and they will exercise their option to repurchase these units after the expiration of their contracts. Hypotheses Communication of risk and the number of new franchised outlets Risk is defined in the Cambridge dictionary (2018) as “danger, or the possibility of danger, defeat, or loss.” In an investment context, it means the possibility of losing some or all of a potential investment. One of the reasons franchisees choose franchising is to mitigate the risks associated with owning their own independent businesses. Franchising provides risk-sharing opportunities between the franchisor and the franchisee and, thus, is preferred by entrepreneurs who are risk-averse (Williams, 1999). Studies show that entrepreneurs are more likely to resort to the organization form of franchising when industry risks are high (Williams, 1999). As potential franchisees resort to franchising to reduce risks, they will be thus less likely to choose a risky franchise.          In addition, given the substantial costs that will be incurred by franchisees and considering that their investment of buying a franchise is an undiversified investment, potential franchisees tend to be risk-averse. Furthermore, risk means danger and uncertainty because there is a possible failure hazard. Considering the investment, time, and effort the franchisees put in their franchised units, they will avoid risky franchises due to concerns about potential failure and the inability to continue the businesses. Therefore, we hypothesize that greater communication of risk will discourage potential franchisees from buying into the franchise system, thus affecting the number of new franchised outlets. Hypothesis 1: The greater the franchisor communicates on risk, the lower the number of new franchised outlets. Communication of returns and the number of new franchised outlets There is no doubt that when people invest in something, they expect to generate gains on their investments. Entrepreneurs choose franchising over owning an independent business to maximize their wealth (Williams, 1999). In addition, franchisees must pay continuous fees and royalties, which diminish their investment returns. Therefore, franchisees would prefer that franchises offer guaranteed returns to keep their units running and profitable. One might propose that the more benefits and returns the franchisors demonstrate, the more value the potential franchisees will see, leading them to view the franchise favorably. Thus, we hypothesize that as franchisors communicate more on the returns of investing in the franchise system, this will make the system attractive to potential franchisees. Thus, communication of returns by franchisors will positively affect the number of new franchised outlets. Hypothesis 2: The greater the franchisor communicates on returns, the higher the number of new franchised stores. Franchise age and the number new franchised outlets The age of the franchise can provide a number of signals to franchisees. Given that the potential franchisees have many different franchises to choose from, they will critically evaluate their options. Of course, franchisees will choose franchises that have proven business formulas and with successful units that are already running, but these qualities do not necessarily mean that the franchises are older. Considering that there are factors other than age that can prove the success and reliability of the franchise (such as the sales of current units), franchisees will more likely consider the negative, hidden implications of a franchise’s age—inertia and possible ownership redirection, as previously explored—rather than positive ones. In addition, it has been demonstrated that older franchises have a higher risk of failure (Bordonaba-Juste, Lucia-Palacios, & Polo-Redondo, 2011). Thus, age is expected to have a negative influence on the decisions of franchisees. It is therefore hypothesized that the older the franchise, the lower the number of newly–opened franchised outlets. Hypothesis 3: The greater the franchisor’s age, the lower the number of new franchised stores. Risk, franchise age, and the number of new franchised outlets As indicated previously, franchisees choose franchising to reduce the risks and uncertainties that usually come with starting their own independent businesses. Coupled with risk, potential franchisees will view the age of the franchise as an increased risk due to concerns of organizational inertia and rigidity. Namely, since inertia increases with age, as the franchise gets older, it will lack the adaptation and flexibility to handle these risks (Hannan & Freeman, 1984). Hence, it is proposed that as age increases, the negative influence of communication of risk on the opening of new franchised outlets will be strengthened. Hypothesis 4: The age of the franchise strengthens the negative relationship between risk and number of new franchised outlets. Return, franchise age and the number of new franchised outlets The main input of franchisors’ supply is the originality and creative ability that allows them to create branded products (Williams, 1999). Inertial forces, however, could hinder franchises’ creativity and innovation as they age. The speed of technological innovations and competition requires organizations to be highly adaptable and quick in their responses. However, age has a negative effect on organizations’ rate of change due to structural inertia (Hannan & Freeman, 1984). Subsequently, older organizations adapt more slowly to opportunities in the environment. Le Mens, Hannan, and Pólos (2014) maintain that environmental changes, specifically the drift in audiences’ tastes, increases failure hazards for older organizations due to their inertia and inability to adapt to new trends. Franchises that do not adapt quickly will lose their competitive advantage and miss out on opportunities that may increase their returns. Moreover, inert franchises could still be investing greatly in response to technological and environmental changes with no real returns because of what is called active inertia. Sull (1999) defines active inertia as “an organization's tendency to persist in the activities that contributed to its past success despite even the most dramatic changes in its competitive environment” (p. 459–460). In other words, these organizations are stuck to old habits and routines, and they fail to respond to changes effectively. Thus,  Hypothesis 5: The age of the franchise weakens the positive relationship between return and number of new franchised outlets. The conceptual framework of the research is presented in Figure 1. METHODOLOGY Research design  The purpose of this research is to investigate how franchisors’ communication of risk and return affects the franchisors’ ability to increase new franchised outlets. To test the research hypotheses, we collect data using the FDDs. Baucus et al. (1993) state that potential franchisees use disclosure documents to choose a franchise from a “menu of franchise opportunities” (p. 2). Disclosure documents have an ample amount of information that can be used for investigating and analyzing issues related to franchising.           An FDD contains detailed information about the franchisor and the franchise system. It organizes 23 items, such as information about the franchisor’s involvement in litigation, sections for initial fees (among others), the franchisor’s and franchisee’s obligations, the franchisee’s rights and restrictions, list of franchise outlets, and contracts.         FDDs are specifically intended for potential franchisees. Although other means of communication, like the business’s website, provides information (Zachary et al., 2011), potential franchisees are closer to making decisions when they examine the FDD. Thus, FDDs and item 1, in particular, can be critical tools for investigating the influence of franchisors’ communications on increasing the new openings of franchised outlets. Item 1 of the FDD provides information—description of the business, market, brand’s name, purpose, products/services, and how long the franchise has been in business. This information is used to understand the business, to gain initial insight into the business’s reliability, and to determine whether it (the business) provides more benefits than risks. Hence, item 1 of the FDD is used for content analysis by examining the impact of risk and returns language on the attractiveness of the franchise outlets.  Sample The FDDs were collected from state regulatory authorities in the United States. Franchises for which two consecutive years of FDDs were available in the state regulatory authorities’ website were included. A convenient sample of 133 franchises was identified. The registered franchises and their FDDs are updated periodically. Most of the registered franchises only had one FDD available in one year; once it expires, the FDD is usually removed and replaced with an updated one. In addition, there are variations between the expiry date of FDDs and their replacements from franchise to franchise, making it more difficult to collect two consecutive years of FDDs at one time. Hence, franchises that made available two years of FDDs were included in the sample. In addition, the data collection period spanned a few months to increase the opportunity of obtaining two consecutive years of FDDs, as franchisors updated their FDDs. FDDs from two consecutive years were used for collecting data within the period 2016–2018. This means that a total of 266 FDDs were collected to ensure that communication of risk and return affect new franchised outlets in the subsequent period.       The data collected from the FDDs included: item 1 content, initial investment, royalty rates, current numbers of franchisee and company-owned stores, and the year the business started franchising. From the subsequent year FDDs, information on new franchise outlets was collected to measure the dependent variable. Examining these variables across two years allows the testing of the research hypotheses about the influence of franchisors’ communications on subsequent years’ new franchised outlets. Content analysis of the FDD  To create the measures of the communication of risk and return, content analysis is employed. Krippendorff (2004) defines content analysis as “a research technique for making replicable and valid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their use” (p.19). Content analysis is the best tool for examining how franchisors communicate with potential franchisees. Content analysis is a more effective and efficient way of collecting and analyzing an abundant amount of information. This is especially feasible with the use of computer-aided text analysis which in this case is LIWC 2015 software (Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan, & Blackburn, 2015).         Content analysis techniques are used in a number of research fields, such as journalism, political science, finance, and social psychology. Also, many areas in the marketing field—consumer research (Kassarjian 1977; Sridhar & Srinivasan, 2012) and advertising (Gross & Sheth, 1989)—have used content analysis. However, its use in franchising research is scarce except when used as a complementing method (Boulay & Stan, 2013; Gauzente, 2002), and it was used in a study that explored franchise branding by examining the rhetoric of the corporate websites (Zachary et al., 2011).           LIWC was chosen for its ability to analyze large amounts of data rapidly. In addition, the software exports quantitative results to Excel so that they can be used in statistical analysis right away. Studies have proven its validity as a measure (Kahn, Tobin, Massey, & Anderson, 2007), and LIWC has been used in both marketing (Berger, & Milkman, 2012; Hewett, Rand, Rust, & van Heerde, 2016; Sridhar & Srinivasan, 2012) and other research fields (Niederhoffer & Pennebaker, 2009). Measures All measures, apart from the dependent variable, are taken from FDDs in time Dependent variable New franchised outlets are measured by the number of newly–opened franchisee outlets in year . Considering the purpose of the study, which is to test the temporal effect of franchisors’ communication on increasing the openings of franchised outlets, new franchised outlets will be a direct measure to test the effect. This is because, unlike growth rate, it ignores termination, non-renewal, or transfer of franchised outlets to company-owned as they not of interest in the current study. Independent variables Communication of risk is measured using the risk variable from the LIWC software. The software calculates the percentage of words for each construct from the total word count by comparing the words in the text to built-in dictionaries. The higher the use of risk–associated words, like danger and doubt, the higher the risk percentage will be (Pennebaker et al., 2015).      Communication of return is measured by the reward variable from the LIWC software. Similar to the risk variable, a high percentage for reward means the high usage of reward–associated words, such as benefits and prize (Pennebaker et al., 2015).        The moderator franchise age is measured as the difference between the calendar year t and the year the franchisor started offering franchising opportunities to franchisees. This data is provided in the FDDs. Control variables We control for various factors that could affect the franchisees’ decision to invest in a system and therefore affect the new franchised outlets.  Royalty rate is important for new franchisees and has an effect on the attractiveness of the franchise and ultimately the franchisees’ decision to buy it (Grünhagen & Dorsch, 2003). Franchisees may also use it to estimate what their expected costs are in the future. Royalty rate is calculated as a percentage of sales.  Initial investment, is controlled as being one of the factors that have a great influence on the franchise system’s size (Shane et al., 2006). It is measured by taking the average of the highest and lowest estimated initial investments required from the franchisee to open a single unit.        Companyowned outlets are used by the franchisors to signal the success of the business idea to prospective franchisees (Mani et al., 2016), company-owned outlets is measured as the number of company-owned outlets in year      Franchised outlets variable is measured as the number of franchised outlets in year t-1. We control for franchised outlets in year  because we expect that it could have a meaningful impact on the number of franchised outlets in year . These effects could be potential concerns for franchisees of encroachment issues and intra-brand competition (Kalnins, 2004). It also signals the desirability and demand for the franchises’ offerings. A semi-log transformation of franchised outlets was used to reduce skewness. Moreover, franchising is expected to be lower for franchises that already have a high proportion of franchised outlets (Sen, 1998).         Word count is the total number of words in the text, and it is controlled due to the possibility that some franchisees might use peripheral cues to evaluate franchisors’ communication. Franchisees might interpret the length of the text as a heuristic of a better message that has greater justifications to choose the franchise. In some cases, the recipients of a message use heuristic processing strategies (Chaiken, 1980). A study on the role of message attributes in persuasion found that message recipients who had little attitude–relevant information in memory (such as prior experiences) to draw upon when evaluating the arguments in a message were persuaded by superficial cues, such as the length of the message (Wood, Kallgren, & Preisler, 1985).  The descriptive statistics and correlations for all the variables are presented in table 1 and table 2, respectively. DATA ANALYSIS To test the hypotheses, Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis was conducted with the new franchised outlets in year (NFO) for franchise brand , as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables, which are all in year , refer to the amount of risk and return communicated by the franchisor in year t-1 (RISKit-1, RETURNit-1), franchise age (FrAGE), number of franchised outlets and company–owned outlets in year  (FOUTLETSit-1 and COUTLETSit-1, respectively), initial investment (IINVESTit-1), royalty rate (RRit-1), and word count (WCit-1). All independent variables were mean-centered for use in analyses to reduce multicollinearity. The interaction terms with FrAGEit-1 (RISKit-1 *FrAGEit-1, RETURNit-1*FrAGEit-1) are also included. Consequently, we estimate the following regression equation:  = β0 + β1 RISKit-1 + β2 RETURNit-1 + β3 FrAGEit-1 + β4 (RISKit-1 *FrAGEit-1+ β5 (RETURNit-1 *FrAGEit-1) + β6 FOUTLETSit-1 + β7 COUTLETSit-1 + β8 IINVESTit-1 + β9 RRit-1 + β10 WCit-1 + ε Results Table 3 contains the results of OLS regression analysis for Model 1 (without the moderator and interaction terms), Model 2 (with the moderator only) and Model 3 (with moderator and interaction terms). In H, we predicted that the more the franchisor communicates on risk in the lower the number of new franchised outlets in . The findings show that franchisors’ risk communication is negatively associated with the number of new franchised outlets (18.22, <.05). Therefore, His supported. Hexpects that the more the franchisor communicates on return in the higher the number of new franchised outlets in However, the results indicate that there is no significant effect of franchisors’ communication of returns on the number of new franchised outlets (-3.23, n.s.). Thus, His not supported. As predicted in H, there is a significant negative relationship between franchise age and openings of new franchised outlets (-0.67, <.05). The results therefore, support HThe coefficient of the interaction term between franchise age and risk on the opening of new franchised outlets is significant (-1.8, < .05); therefore, supporting H. However, there was no support for Hwhich predicted a stronger positive effect of communication of return on the number of new franchised outlets as the franchise gets older (.02, n.s.). As such, His not supported. For the control variables, we find that the number of franchised outlets in year  (β6= 8.10, p< .001) significantly and positively affect the number of new franchised outlets in year Royalty rate (β9= -2.52, p< .05) significantly and negatively affects the number of new franchised outlets. Also, word count (β10= 0.004, p< .05) is significantly and positively associated with the number of new franchised outlets. However, the number of company-owned outlets and average investment in t-1 does not significantly affect the number of new franchised outlets in Post hoc analysis of risk communication and age interaction For a better understanding, we provide a graphical representation of the interaction of riskt-1 and franchise aget-1 (Figure 2). We conducted a simple slope analysis to examine the significant effects in the interaction between riskt-1 and franchise aget-1 (Aiken and West 1991). We assessed the effects of franchise age at the mean +/− 1 standard deviation to represent high and low levels of age. As demonstrated in Figure 2, in the presence of low franchise age, risk had no effect on the number of new franchised outlets (-92.96, n.s.). For high franchise age, risk decreased the number of new franchised outlets (-118.49, p< .05). DISCUSSION Theoretical implication We find evidence in support of the role played by franchisors’ communication on new franchised outlets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has content analyzed the communication of risk and returns by franchisors and its influence on new franchised outlets. Our findings on the effect of the communication of risk contribute to the literature on the strategic use of rhetoric. It has been argued that if franchisees were rewarded with higher expected returns, they would be willing to accept higher risks (Martin, 1988). Yet, the findings of this study reveal that franchisees place emphasis on the communication of risk but not that of returns. The findings suggest that potential losses exert a greater impact on prospective franchisees than potential gains. This is consistent with prospect theory’s notion that “losses loom larger than gains” (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p.279) and that people’s discontent with losing is more prevalent than the pleasure they might get by gaining the same amount. This study’s analysis of the franchisor’s communication illuminates the possible influences on a potential franchisee’s decision–making process. Studies on how franchisees decide on and select a franchise will provide franchisors with insights on how to increase the system size. Yet, there is still a gap in franchising literature on what makes franchisees select a particular franchise. Most franchise selection studies were focused on franchisors’ selection of franchisees (Jambulingham & Nevin, 1999; Clarkin & Swavely, 2006, Wang & Altinay; 2008, Altinay & Okumus, 2010). Contributing to the franchisee–selection literature, the results of this study reveal that high communication of risk reduces the favorability of the franchise to potential franchisees, as evidenced by lower new franchised outlets.          Moreover, the findings of the influence of age will contribute to answering a part of franchise growth’s fundamental unanswered questions that (Mani et al., 2016) identified in their review. The finding of franchisor’s age on openings new franchised outlets was contrary to prior findings that longevity of the franchise is valued by franchisees (Baucus et al. 1993). The findings reveal that franchises’ age has a negative influence on franchisees’ decision to buy a franchise. There are several possible explanations for this result. Firstly, as the franchises get older, it is more likely that they have achieved or are close to achieving their expansion goals. This means that these franchises reached saturation, and thus they have decreased or stopped their expansion efforts. Secondly, as mentioned in the literature review, the probability of ownership redirection is increased for older, mature franchises (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1968). This means that ownership redirection could either be a possible concern by potential franchisees in older franchises or that the franchisors themselves are not looking to expand anymore.          This study also finds that the franchises’ age moderates the relationship between risk and the opening of new franchised outlets. This can be explained by structural inertia (Hannan & Freeman, 1984) that old organizations tend to develop. When older franchisors’ communication contains high levels of risk, the potential franchisees may deduce that this franchise could be incapable of adapting with these risks due to inertia. A thorough search of the relevant literature yielded only one related article in franchising (Winter, Szulanski, Ringov & Jensen, 2012), where structural inertia theory was partially employed. However, instead of examining the whole franchise, Winter et al. (2012) examined franchised outlets and how accurate replication versus local adaptation influences their survival. In addition, their data set only included franchised outlets with a maximum of 11 years old. This study, in contrast, has a sample that varied in age from one to 62, allowing for more insights on the effects of franchise age. Managerial implication The findings of this study offer several implications for franchisors. To develop effective communication strategies to interact with prospective franchisees, one must understand what factors influence a franchisee’s decision–making process when buying a franchise. The study reveals how franchisors’ word their communication to potential franchisees with respect to risk can negatively influence the decision of whether or not to buy the franchise. The negative relationship between risk and the openings of new franchised outlets worsens as the franchise gets older. Hence, these implications follow.         First, franchisors must carefully think about their communication, as it could greatly influence the decisions of prospective franchisees. To persuade a potential franchisee, value must be conveyed; franchisees incur substantial financial costs when investing in franchising and will try to avoid risky businesses. In addition, failure to pay enough attention to how franchisors communicate to prospective franchisees could undermine their prior efforts to attract franchisees up to reading the franchisor’s communication. While it is not recommended that franchisors be less candid and transparent than they were before to potential franchisees, franchisors should word their communication in a more assuring way by focusing on the benefits of the franchise to encourage potential franchisees. The following text is from one of the highest risk words communicating franchisors and as can be seen it is communicating on risk in a considerable frequency:   “There are no guarantees of your success as there exist both typical and special business risk factors including: changing market conditions; competition; cost of supplies, equipment, real estate and improvements, capital and labor; your own health and continuity of your management; continuation of sources of supply; quality and availability of labor; availability of financing; recession or depression locally, nationally, or internationally; wars; strikes; emergencies; natural and man-made disasters; litigation; and liability and casualty losses. Risks of the business include industry and market developments, such as pricing policies of competitors, and supply and demand”         Second, older franchises should provide more incentives to neutralize the risk associated with age. If the franchisors are communicating real risks, then they should emphasize the advantages of mature organizations. For instance, reputation, reliability, brand name, and stability should all be stressed along with the risk associated with the franchise. Another possible way to alleviate the influence of risk on potential the decisions of franchisees is by communicating franchisors’ efforts to mitigate future risks and uncertainties. Limitations and future research The findings should be placed in the context of several limitations that we hope to be regarded as opportunities for further research. First, the data is obtained from the US market so it may not generalize to other markets. Some studies suggest cross-cultural differences in the proportion of company-owned versus franchised outlets between countries. A study by Perrigot, and Cliquet (2008) found that compared to US franchises, Brazil’s and France’s franchises have almost triple the number of company-owned outlets. Further studies could explore the generalizability of this study’s findings to other countries.         Moreover, prior research also suggests that there are variations between industries and their investment requirements, risks, and dual distribution structure. The type of constraints that franchisors face in each industry also influence the degree of franchising they require to expand. In some industries, for instance, there is a higher preference for company-owned outlets like the restaurants’ sector (Dant et al., 2008), while hotels show less dual distribution (Kalnins, 2004). In addition, some industries may have higher innate risks, while others may have lower risks. Dant, Paswan, and Kaufmann (1996) stress the importance of industry-specific differences between franchise systems, and they encourage considering them in the analysis. Unfortunately, the classification of industries and possible variance in results between different franchise industries were not considered in this study due to the small sample size. Thus, more research is needed to validate the findings while considering industry differences.        Another limitation due to data availability constraints is using two consecutive years only while it would have been ideal to include data of more than two consecutive years to test the hypotheses. In addition, including data of multiple years in future studies will contribute to a deeper understanding of unit growth as a whole throughout a number of years.       Additionally, most researches that considered franchisees’ perspective interviewed or surveyed current franchisees. Future studies could examine the views of potential franchisees instead of current ones to gain deeper insights into their motives and factors that they consider while looking for a franchise to buy. Franchisees’ perception of the risk and return of franchises can be examined using surveys while also investigating the influence of any prior business experience on their level of risk tolerance.

Corporate governance is defined broadly as the system of laws, rules, and factors that control operations at a company. Much of the previous research on hybrid organizations, which exist between markets and hierarchies such as franchise organizations, largely ignores corporate governance. Previous research has focused mainly on franchisee-franchisor channel governance. This study utilizes qualitative explorative interviews to explore franchise firms’ ownership structures and resultant governance dynamics. All four case companies in this study share an appreciation of the low-cost, low-investment model of franchising with a contractual base. This paper finds that a fair and balanced approach to all stakeholders with regard to governance capabilities is needed for retailers to remain relevant and competitive. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study in the retailing literature to focus on corporate governance and ownership in franchising platforms and contribute a typology of ownership models in franchising.Keywords: Franchising, Governance, Ownership, Retailing, Business modelThe Impact of Ownership: Exploratory Case Studies in Governance of Franchise Retail Organizations Introduction  Franchising has become an increasingly popular business model in recent decades (Dant, Grünhagen, and Windsperger 2011; Combs and Ketchen 2003; Holmstrom 1999), spurring extensive research on the franchisee-franchisor relationship (Hsu, Kaufmann, and Srinivasan 2017; Hendrikse and Jiang 2011; Argyres and Liebeskind 1999). At the same time, scholarly work has largely neglected the higher-order governance relationships that exist in the franchising model (Massimino and Lawrence 2019). These overlooked relationships include those between governing boards and management, as well as those between management and owner/operators such as franchisees (von Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, and Nilsson 2020; Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020). As a result, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the role and influence of the governance process and mechanics in these franchise companies. This paper seeks to address this gap by focusing on governance in the retail sector, where business models such as franchising help retailers grow. Though some studies have examined the process of organizational change within franchising more generally (Bradach 1997), we lack knowledge on how different franchise companies are structured with different ownership models but use the same business model and franchising strategy of multi-level ownership. For this research, we chose an explorative qualitative case study approach (R. Yin 2003; Seawright and Gerring 2008) because research on franchise governance is still emerging. With this qualitative, multiple-case study methodology, we offer an overview of how the different ownership structures at four companies influence governance of the business. In doing so, we answer the call for exploring an expanded view of external financing in franchise governance (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020). By applying an expanded, higher-order view (see Figure 1 in C, D, E) of the external impact on the franchising system, we attempt to merge the previously isolated perspectives of corporate governance and franchising to explore if and how the former can drive and transform the latter.  In this case-study, we broadly define corporate governance as the system of laws, rules, and factors that control operations at a company (Gillan and Starks 1998). Franchise operations entail important decisions including ownership, control systems, training, and allocation of resources, communication, and advertising via co-ops. Wide variance exists in the governance of this hybrid organizational form, a factor that remains little understood (Combs and Ketchen 2003). Changes at the higher ownership level are nonetheless consequential, impacting unit-level performance and influencing franchisee-franchisor relations (Bernstein and Sheen 2016; Lawrence and Kaufmann 2011). Given these factors, our primary research question is this: How can the significant variety of corporate governance structures in franchising contribute to our understanding of corporate governance?  This article is structured as follows: First, we present an emerging framework of franchise governance (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020). Second, we present our research design and fieldwork. Next, we detail our empirical findings and discuss their implications. Finally, we provide directions for future research. Theory in Governance of Franchising  Theoretical frameworks adopted in the field of governance in franchising  Traditional areas of corporate governance have widened beyond boards and compensation to include the role of owners and equity market owners (Jansson, Jonnergård, and Larsson Olaison 2013). This expanded view is rooted in the notion of property rights, or behavioral relations among decision makers for the use of potentially valuable resources (Ostrom 1990). The theory of property rights posits that different people can function as barriers to particular aspects of a single resource (Barzel 1997).  To be able to move forward in the fields of franchise and governance research, we must reflect on the progression of franchising research. The first theory of ownership in this field is the ownership redirection thesis by Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1968), which posits that franchising companies are heading in the direction either of entirely franchised systems or completely company-owned systems. Harrigan (1984) later challenged this thesis with the stable plural forms thesis, specifically the notion of tapered integration. The stable plural forms thesis argues that each type of ownership structure offers a distinctive governance benefit, thus franchise companies continue to invest in company-owned and franchised operations. The stable plural forms thesis further argues that plural form organizations likely are the ideal choice for efficiency-committed companies. Building on this important research in franchise governance could allow us to better understand which theory is more likely in practice, considering the limited empirical evidence supporting the stable plural forms thesis (Lafontaine and Kaufmann 1994; Baker and Dant 2008).  Figure 1. Conceptual model framework of analysis Our research is founded on an expanded model of external financing contracts in a franchising system, wherein the corporate governance structure grows even more complex (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020), as illustrated with the Figure 1 in areas C, D, and E. Area C represents equity owners’ and debt holders’ external governance of the franchisor. External governance in Area D represents equity and debt holders of franchisees, which are independent entities with their own balance sheets and ownership structures. Area E represents other external stakeholders that do not have to engage directly in an economic exchange with the franchise firm (e.g., franchisee associations, suppliers, customers, media, auditors, communities, politics, laws, and regulations). The semi-internal, franchise organization on the internal governance side of Figure 1 holds the franchise right to operations for a limited time (Area B). Figure 1 shows how debt, or creditors such as banks, can govern by applying different covenants/credit ratings, while equity, or investors, can govern through the board of directors (Area A), adding complexity to the corporate governance structures of franchising. Methodology and Fieldwork Method  Case studies allow the researcher to examine previously unexplored, emerging phenomena (Eisenhardt 1989) and gather rich, empirical descriptions of particular instances of a phenomenon (R. K. Yin 1994; Eisenhardt and Graebner 2007). We chose the qualitative case study approach for this context because the field of franchise governance is still emerging, while research on the implications and impact of governance in retail franchising is limited. Qualitative case study methodologies, moreover, are necessary when studying complex research areas (Creswell and Clark 2018) where only limited previous academic research and theory exist.  Data collection Data collection began with multiple sources, creating a base of information to support our findings (R. Yin 2003). The main secondary, publicly available data included annual reports, analyst reports, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, prior academic articles, books, business press articles, and other industry reports on the case companies, as well the franchise companies’ websites and direct observations. These secondary data allowed us to form a rich picture of the businesses throughout their history. One way to ensure trustworthiness of the data is to make what Lincoln and Guba (1990) call “member checks” with respondents, or confirming that the developing interpretations make sense to them. Respondents validated the events and our interpretation when contacted. This technique, combined with secondary data collection and a chain of evidence, was used to triangulate the data, interviews, and observations in order to.  gain more understanding of the events. Because case studies typically are based on a variety of data sources (R. K. Yin 1994), we also gathered information from multiple sources to corroborate the same fact or phenomenon, as suggested by Patton (2002). In addition to the interviews and direct observations in corporate offices, findings from earlier reviews and conceptual studies in the franchising literature (Dant, Grünhagen, and Windsperger 2011; Nijmeijer, Fabbricotti, and Huijsman 2014; von Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, and Nilsson 2020; Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020) seek to bring clarity and help triangulate a robust case study. To make the case studies’ empirical descriptions as rich as possible, these secondary data allowed us to form a rich picture of the businesses throughout the four case companies.  Fieldwork method A uniform, semi-structured interview agenda was custom made for this multiple-case study (see Appendix A), with questions drawn from conceptual work and from findings in an earlier structural review study (Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020; von Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, and Nilsson 2020). We divided the areas of inquiry into four areas: corporate governance situations in accordance with the traditional view of corporate governance, governance challenges unique to franchising, governance modes, and contracts. To identify the key components of the governance in franchising for comparison, we selected case companies with varied ownership structures (George et al. 2005; Ludvigsson-Wallette and Lawrence 2020).  We decided to focus on large multinational enterprises (MNE) with a global presence and sales volume between $3.5 billion and $40 billion annually, which we take as an indication of the franchised business model’s success.  Multiple Cases and Analysis Multiple cases allow for broader investigation of research questions and theoretical expansion. As Eisenhardt and Graebner (2007) note, a few additional cases added to an initially small count can significantly affect the quality of the evolving theory. For example, adding three cases to a case study is modest in terms of numbers, but offers four times the analytic power (R. Yin 2003). Therefore, theory building from multiple cases usually yields stronger and more generalizable theory, in addition to research in theory testing. A multiple–case study design has no rules regarding how many  cases are required to satisfy replication requirements.  The case study was analysed similarly to the question-and answer format approach followed by R. Yin (2003), where complementary secondary data sources are used to gain an in-depth understanding of multi-level ownership in franchising platforms and their business models. Similarly to that approach, this paper focuses on the processes that lead to the capturing of value, how firms use owners in their governance models, and how that model affects the business. Data analysis followed a three-step process from data analysis to interpretation that is common in case study research (R. Yin 2003). First, we aggregated the data from each company, interpreting common patterns and differences. Second, we combined, sorted, and linked the data from the four cases. We then organized the data according to the question-and-answer framework (R. Yin 2003) in order to identify the value propositions. Case study evidence does not require the traditional presentation form; instead, we applied an alternative question-and-answer form (R. Yin 2003), taking each answer that contains all the relevant evidence and strengthening it with citations.  The four companies in this study are multinational retailers with a number of key differences but they all have in common the use of the franchising business model. Table 1 presents descriptive data on these four case companies. Table 1. Results  We present our results in the order of the research questions posed. In establishing the purpose of the meeting, the author clearly communicated to respondents that he was examining corporate governance forms and writing a case paper focusing on different franchising ownership models. What follows are the narrativized question-and-answer sessions of the  semi-structured interview protocols. Research Question 1 - Owners Company 1 – Cooperative owned The first research question entailed determining how owners affect the franchising system (see Appendix for full questioner protocol). For Company 1, we specifically asked: How does the cooperative owner affect governance in the franchise system. This question solicited a long pause and the response: “Next, question please.” The CEO then stated:  In the beginning we were independent and in our firm, there is no natural one part like other chains down the street. The structure of the resources is the opposite other firms and the owners; the members do not drive the firm to grant them to run stores.

The Company 1 owner also has never fully examined whether franchising is generally more economically profitable. As a result, Company 1 does not have a complete franchise model for franchisees because it does not own the store, warehouse, or inventory. Company 1 is like a cleaning company where operators come in with their staff and run the store. A key challenge for Company 1 remains at the political level: How does the company incorporate a franchise model into a cooperative model and maintain this model’s economic cycle?The member companies within Company 1 use the business form of franchisees and in the future, the structure of regional cooperatives could perhaps act as a franchise agent. As the CEO noted: “If the arrangement of our governance structure would change and collect royalties in a different way, we would be more efficient and profitable.” A thin line separates a cooperative franchise and a federation aggregate with member organizations, not individuals. As a Company 1 executive states: “Franchise main strategy is a motivational management tool without a purpose. The firm has then built up governance structures we cannot break out of and then continue mostly per tradition and culture.” Worth noting is the difference between controlling franchisees versus employees, a challenge when a “family” feel is desired more than that of an investment firm. Company 1 has a majority owner with a 37% stake, as well as associations encompassing approximately 3.5 million individual owners who have one vote each. Some wealthy associations have assumed direct ownership in the operating company. As a franchise strategy, Company 1 is franchising the worst-performing stores in hopes of a turnaround. An interesting example of the franchise reinvestment strategy occurs with store reimaging, a financial burden the franchisee bears only in part. Company 1 has not found any other ways to roll out a chain-wide reimaging initiative without using a corporate cash-intensive push strategy.  Company 2 – Foundation owned Because a foundation, not an individual, owns Company 2, the organization is, in theory, owner-less. How, then, does Company 2’s foundation owner affect the franchise system?  The previous owner of Company 2 was involved in the setup of the entire structure. The franchisor is one company, the owner of which is a foundation that gives an exclusive assignment to the franchisor to develop all products for franchisees. Sales and food service operations include a supply company that buys up products and distributes them to franchisees. One very large franchisee represents 90% of the units and also is a foundation. Other franchisees are large companies with other diverse businesses in their respective countries. One of the franchisees is a family firm that was instrumental in creating value for the original owner when the transfer into foundation status occurred. For the original owner, it was important to maintain its core values and concepts and not become publicly traded. This is driven further by the values of the many people who have grown up working in the firm. In one respect, the original owner did not receive anything for his creation. The franchise governance solution, however, created a family-owned bank that served franchisees and itself became a franchisee to the foundation. Company 2 also diversified idiosyncratic risk by letting in other franchisees as an alternative to the public markets but balancing this growth with more governance. The owner in Company 2 decides and grants franchise rights for a whole country, then the franchisee commits to a market penetration plan. The firm now has three different sizes of stores as a function of these franchisees. The franchisor contracts for at least 10 years and the franchisee pays a 3% royalty fee on revenue instead of an up-front fee. The idea of risk diversification without going public creates a franchise organization that steers the company in alignment with the values of Company 2. When one part of the sister company becomes a franchisee, they know store-level profit dynamics and can benchmark and understand their business partners from a franchisee point of view. Some unique governance issues do arise when the franchisor is a franchisee but not in the same legal structure. Company 2 aspires to manage this issue with a legal, operational, and communicative structure. Supervisory boards lead these three structures and alignment takes time, resulting in a sluggish organization. Given the unique ownership structure of Company 2, its founding family appoints members of the board at the highest level of the organization. Company 3 – Private Family owned In a family-owned firm like Company 3, how does the owner affect the franchise system? Company 3 wants to own as much of the supply chain as possible and has used the franchising model for 10 years while establishing a presence in countries in the Middle East. In Company 3, the owners are very involved in laying the groundwork for a franchise partnership decision. As such, it is very important to Company 3 that employees are aligned with its values and want to work closely with the franchisor. Company 3 also exerts control through rigid contracts with reconciliations and demands. Its board of directors decides whether and with whom to collaborate and is very involved in managing the franchise model. Company 3 operates in 10 countries in the Middle East and has an investment firm partner for the rest of Asia.  Interestingly, many partner franchisees are also large family firms. Franchising for Company 3 is about the risk of sharing and knowledge in negotiating locations; certain brands may not be included in the franchisee portfolios due to potential conflicts of interest. The franchisors’ focus is to be the most important brand to the client. With its franchisee partners, the CEO of Company 3 said the goal is that they become “like a part of us,” adding that “when you mention ‘us and them,’ it is an error. It is just ‘we,’ together. We have franchise partners but with family-valued partnerships.” This message signals that Company 3 is seeking a perfect match. The common denominator from an ownership standpoint is family values. Many of Company 3’s competitors, by contrast, are more financially focused in selecting partnerships and pursuing other business models.  Company 3 has one majority owner and many minority owners. Given ownership’s intense focus on values alignment, these minority shareholders appear to have a disconnect in purpose regarding why they hold shares. Specifically, the majority owner has an “ownership forever” mindset and considers the minority owners focused on the short term. This appears to create an “ownership disconnect” for the firm.  For Company 3, its business model represents what one executive called a “ridiculously profitable franchise solution.” Company 3 understands the risk assumed in controlling the brand, a responsibility that encompasses managing how it is both perceived and handled. Overall, Company 3 states that its long-term focus is to control by values as opposed to by governance.  Company 4 – Publicly owned How does a publicly traded franchise owner (Company 4) affect its franchise system? Our meeting with Company 4 began with a clear answer: The owners are the investors that own the stock, while long holders are mutual funds, hedge funds, and other asset managers. From a governance perspective, one executive stated: The owners affect the franchise system because the investors like our business and invest in our business because of our franchise system, but also because they like the franchising model we have, with the lower cost of capital, risk/reward, and entrepreneurs that run the business. The franchisor-owning investors do not interact with the franchisees and the franchisor does not provide much direct access to them. Globally, Company 4 has 94% franchised businesses. As one executive stated: “Franchisees are the most important to our business. How successful they are is a direct impact to our businesses.” The ratio of franchised versus company-owned stores appears to have been decided after discussions with the largest owners—relatively speaking, as these owners control no more than 5% of outstanding shares—who are interested primarily in cash return. The shareholder owners understand how important franchisees’ success is to the business and how valuable franchise system-franchisee relationships are. When Company 4 decides the dividend and cash return, they discuss the matter with investors and large owners. From a governance perspective, Company 4’s CFO frames the capital allocation strategy as: What is the right amount to put into the business? The dividend payout ratio is 60% right now, so we generate a lot of cash. The first use of capital is reinvestment in the business, and second option is dividend. The allocation of capital to the dividend is a board decision. The franchisees are not members of the board and are mostly interested in the reinvestment of generated cash in the business again. This could lead to a conflict of interest.  Company 4’s executive management goes to the board with recommendations on fund allocations to investors through dividends and franchise business reinvestment. Some franchisees think they should be on the board but Company 4 does not agree, though it does invite franchisees to present to the board. As one board member stated, “[Franchisees] sometimes will be in direct conflict and the board’s purpose is to be looking after the share owner.” The interesting part of a publicly traded franchise company is that franchisees can be both owner-operators but also owner-shareholders of the franchisor. This could be viewed both as a conflict of interest or as a “perfect interest” in both a local business (franchisee) and the brand owner (franchisor). Company 4 wants people on the board that understand franchising and have experience with the model through a variety of brands but franchisees are perceived as having invested in the business long term with different goals in mind. Company 4 also co-invests in stores’ system upgrades, covering roughly half the cost.  In recent years, activist investors pressed Company 4 to pursue refranchising, or convert corporate-owned stores to franchise stores; to restructure; sell real estate; monetarizing; and leveraging up the firm. The investors were less concerned about the credit rating than Company 4 and advocated for assuming more debt and returning more cash to shareholders.  Company 4 uses franchising because of its heritage and the value of locally connected entrepreneurs, in addition to the low capital needed for the model. The company also uses franchising because investors earn higher rates of return. Historically, the founder of Company 4 hired franchisees from a traditional perspective: few stores and a family focus. Today, Company 4 is challenging itself by reconsidering the profile of a franchisee: What if franchisees were allowed to invest all capital in the business, essentially becoming larger investment firms? By reconsidering the historical profile of the franchisee, this change entails going from a small equity stake (i.e., traditional franchisee) to a large equity stake (i.e., new investor-led model). Company 4 appears to have launched the large equity stake model, perhaps with the intent of financing and focusing on governing only the brand and intangible assets. The main reason Company 4 uses franchising seems to be for capital allocation. Less evident is the traditional conceptualization of channel research in the franchising model. Investors drive the franchise model by meeting with the owners and the board of directors, then create a governance system that acts as an internal capital market by refranchising, generating capital for the franchisor. Company 4 has no majority owner but many public minority owners represented by mutual and hedge funds, their stake not exceeding 5%. Company 4 manages owners’ expectations by listening to them and assessing whether issues and questions that arise are outliers or common among owners. Company 4 had to convince the investors by analyzing their business showing what they were doing why.  Summary Research Question 1 - Owners The first research question focused on examining how differing ownership structures affect their respective franchising systems. Specifically, what is the right amount to put back in the business? Company 4’s biggest owners are passive with no more than 5% of the outstanding shares. Going back to the question if and how the owner effected the franchise system. This is exemplified by insights from an executive who stated: the quote of an executive that stated; The owners impact even as a periodic (mutual fund, hedge fund) owners in a public franchise-owned company. These owners bring ideas to the management (CEO/CFO), then management takes the ideas to the board of directors and the owners force us to look and analyze everything, including the long-term strategy and the decision to increase cash dividend and refranchise thousands of stores at our firm. Both the family and foundation companies have a similarly high degree of owner involvement. The cooperative and the public company, meanwhile, have a similarly low degree of owner involvement given the owner’s distance in terms of geographic location and levels away from firm decision making. Overall, the companies and their owners do not appear to position maximizing shareholder value as the primary goal. Instead, this goal is alongside others such as security; longevity of concept and business model; family legacy; and satisfaction of customers, employees, and suppliers. With these other goals taking prominence, the corporate governance perspective is an important contribution in the focus of stakeholder balance. Our case-study companies are challenging the way we define the franchisee, confirming that the historical profile of the franchisee is changing. Hedge funds and mutual fund investors (owners) are forcing companies to review and challenge their franchise strategy as value-driven family firms team up with large investment family firms. Research Question 2 - The bank and other credit-lenders Company - Cooperative owned Our second question asks how the bank and other credit lenders affect the franchising system. Company 1 has no external financing from banks because it cleared all loans and sold real estate to repay them in recent years. In the future, Company 1 may need capital related to re-imaging projects or acquisitions. Today, capital is tucked away and the company has started to form its own credit companies. Other credit lenders are the member associations that have investments in the operating company. One form of funding is deposits of member contributions through associations, which come from members’ accumulated funds. The 3.5 million members create the funds and their contribution capital is $350 million, plus the associations’ excess contributions. Operating company statutes require Company 1 to have a sound capital bond that promotes the cooperative's independence and development. Company 2 – Foundation owned At Company 2, bank and financial services are used for land purchases, with loans tied to covenants. Building purchases are sometimes leased to other companies. The foundation uses its own bank and also provides financial services to franchisees. The firm owns both real estate and the land. With future new store concepts, especially those opened by other franchisees, this may be an issue in city centers, where leasing is largely the only option. Will the franchisor control the franchisees differently in the future if they do not own the real estate?  Company 3 – Private Family owned Company 3 leases virtually all locations and does not use debt because it is internally self-funded in addition to franchise partners that assume debt and sign leases to open new stores. Company 3 historically has had a strong balance sheet and leases through other credit lenders. As an executive at Company 3 notes: Since we use franchisees, they finance their stores and the rest from their own cash flow. Franchise partners do not have the same financial strength as we do (the franchisor) but they are the ones who are responsible for the financing. Company 4 – Publicly owned For Company 4, banks serve both the franchisor and franchisees, while banks serve as an important part of the franchising business. A hugely important part of the system is financing, where banks offer franchisees unique solutions. The franchisor maintains relationships with the banks so the franchisees receive financing, co-investing with franchisees in company-mandated upgrades at roughly half the cost to help with covenants and debt-coverage ratios. Sometimes Company 4 also provides a guarantee on the loans and the banks base the lending on the brand equity. The banks are comfortable lending to the franchisees and historically have received a “halo effect” for working with such a strong brand. Company 4 generally focuses on a low-cost, low-capital model and does better business as a “local company” in every country. In addition to banks, other credit lenders offer a premium with good rates. Company 4 co-invests to speed up growth. Summary Research Question 2 - The bank and other credit lenders More than half of the firms share similarities in the form of loans from a bank and other credit lenders. They all have some debt covenants they are required to meet, which function as a part of the firms’ governance system. The ownership strategy and financing of real estate are somewhat similar in that three of the four companies mostly own their real estate. This underrated real estate-financial ownership governance tool is important as it facilitates control of sites and changes in operations while maintaining a brand presence geographically. Among other similarities in financing is that two of the firms, the cooperative and foundation owned companies, have moved toward owning their own bank and credit lending alternatives for customers and franchise partners. A common theme is that franchisee partners are considered an external source of capital when they use their own funds and borrowed funds to grow concepts. Research Question 3 - Law, regulations, and auditors Company 1- Cooperative owned The third question asks how the law, regulations, and auditors affect the franchising system. As stated by one executive:  The legal perspective is top of mind all the time because legally, franchise is something like a developed commission model with a good contract in civil law. In addition, in some counties it is legally tax advantageous to have a franchise arrangement.  Company 1 does not co-invest in franchisees’ businesses and uses relatively short, three- to five-year contracts. If the franchisee store is not adequately maintained, the franchisor has the right to terminate the franchise contract, which presents as an incomplete contract. This process comes with a great deal of documentation on the process of charging expense items. As such, the actual control is considerable and follows strict rules.  Company 2 – Foundation owned For Company 2, laws and regulations affect its ownership structure because of imports and exports. The franchise system is changing due to legal restrictions. In addition, product compliance also needs to go through all local country rules. By law, franchisees receive updates on rules, what retail operations need, and how to sell the product. Retail franchisees take responsibility for local issues but the retail franchisor manages products as common practice due to design flaws.  Company 2 is confident that all parties assume both reputational risk vs financial risk is for everyone. The organization further understands that in a shared governance model where all share a common brand interest, it cannot take a traditional “owner owns everything” approach. As such, new governance models are required, especially when the largest franchisee’s sales volume exceeds that of the franchisor.  Company 3 – Private Family owned In Company 3, auditors work closely with the legal department and complex contracts control companies’ operations. Even store design is controlled with contracts, reflecting a strategy to control as much as possible through contracts that, crucially, are also well written. Because this creates an incomplete contract, it necessitates managing with relationships. Recently, a franchise competitor of Company 3 went insolvent because it managed franchisees more with contracts than through relationships. This example shows that a contract cannot completely replace a relationship, the latter of which is an important mechanism for control. Company 4 – Publicly owned For Company 4, the law, regulations, and auditors exert some effect. Company 4 follows its business model plan and legally adapts the business idea in different markets. Employees can become a legal issue in some cases where franchisees hire and fire their own employees. Sometimes the employees legally do not know for whom they work, the franchisee or the franchisor. As an executive board member stated:  The regulation drives the model for franchisees. When you have many franchisees, the risk and impact is bigger than to hire one firm or person as a franchisee in a region. Legally, franchising makes things take a little more time when you have to convince the system on changes instead of just making changes to a vertically, fully owned company. Summary Research Question 3 - Law, regulations, and auditors All of our case study companies must meet franchising systems’ legal ownership restrictions in different markets. Similarity of financial risk is the theme of legally the companies need to collaborate with a shared governance models. They all share a common interest in the firm’s brand, which means new governance models are required. Some of the firms differ in their perceptions regarding the legal tax benefits of franchising. Even if important, however, it does not seem to be the key driver and origination of the business model for most firms. In all companies, laws and regulations affect their ownership structure, sometimes due to imports and exports, on other occasions due to different global regions’ retail restrictions.Research Question 4 – Suppliers Company 1 – Cooperative owned Our fourth research question asks how suppliers affect the franchising system. Company 1’s suppliers are sometimes franchisor owned, while franchisees periodically buy self-imported products for in-store display. Nevertheless, considering the franchisor perspective, if self-imported products are sold by the franchisee, then the franchisor may need to be more competitive with pricing. In the cooperative model, the firm has even greater opportunities to sell its products because it owns the generic brands sold in the stores. Company 2 – Foundation owned In Company 2, the franchisor’s executive board member notes: “We have an assignment and goal to deliver minus 1-2% cost for products sold per year for the retail franchisees but can be more or less adjusted for currency and other changes per market.” Governance of the franchisor, also a supplier, is done through a supervisory board, audit committee, management board, and a finance committee. The franchisor’s core objectives are to provide a wide range and supply to align the entire value chain of franchisees. Strategic franchisee counsels are the forum for large franchisees to have input on range and supply. Company 2 owns some of its own suppliers and even factories. Company 3 – Private Family owned For Company 3, the system of suppliers is structured on an outsourced base. Commenting on this system, an executive board member stated: “We think it is too much risk to own suppliers or factories. Franchisees sometimes even solve their own logistics themselves but the franchisees still buy directly from us.” This markup business is a tool for Company 3 to make money on the franchise purchase; from a risk management perspective, it provides a cost-control effect.  Company 4 – Publicly owned For Company 4, the suppliers are the key to success. They have a program to source for good and focus on a “three-legged stool” composed of suppliers, franchisees, and the franchisor. For the franchisor, this system has been a successful model for stakeholders to feel empowered and to collaborate. The suppliers, franchisees, and franchisor collectively give Company 4 scalability, higher volumes, and better prices. Company 4 does not own its suppliers. Summary Research Question 4 – Suppliers In summary, the franchising systems in different markets at times are the suppliers. Retailers rarely own their suppliers but they have in common a mix of suppliers owned and not owned. Many of the suppliers for the firms have themselves grown into large global companies. The foundation-owned firm is unique in its ownership of the factory, the supplier, and components used in all factories. The franchise model governs the goods sold to consumers through the contract of purchase, meaning the franchisee must buy the products from the franchisor at set prices and then sell them at a recommended price. Research Question 5 – The Board of Directors Company 1 – Cooperative owned Our fifth research question involved determining how the board of directors affects the franchising system. At the board level of Company 1, franchisees are not a topic of discussion and no related top-level strategy exists. The cooperative company has not found the right business economic operation model in its franchise structure, the disconnect being that most problem units are being franchised. The boards of the associations have no franchise-related directive and do not discuss it. Company 1 has a modified limited franchise model. As long as the regional cooperatives cannot act as local master franchisees with control and recruitment oversight, the board is completely undeveloped and the member versus franchisee conflict remains an issue. Company 2 – Foundation owned Within Company 2 are many different boards and even one franchisee on the owner/foundation board of directors. This is not the largest franchisee but part of the family that decided to make the company foundation owned. The point of being a franchisee is to have some part still owned directly by the founding family. The board often discusses franchisees and the potential of collaboration and alignment with different levels. The many boards are supervisory board and management boards that are very small, with no women or external members. At these board meetings, Company 2 representatives discuss ownership issues, how to develop the brand, and financial investment agendas. At the supervisory board and management board meetings, the franchisor meets the need for input on the development of range and supply. Company 3 – Private Family Owned Company 3 has no franchisees on the board and does not collaborate with franchisees. The board and the CEO are involved in all new decisions about new franchisee partners. The enthusiastic operating chairman sets the direction and develops most new franchisee partnerships. Suggested remunerations and new contracts go through the board. The board also discusses the importance of franchise contracts and ownership structure of franchisees are mirroring the family owned firm with large family investment offices as franchisees. Different corporate governance codes and laws led Company 3 to use the franchise model, which is based less on contracts and more on relationships, a “handshake” between the owning family and franchisee families. The board is involved in decisions around franchising but initiatives and relationships between the CEO/chairman and families are the most important. However, the board does not talk much about the franchise other than new agreements or renewals. Control of the network franchise organization is formally mandated by the board down to a business development department that works with the board, manages the network franchise organization operationally, and is responsible for franchisees. The department also serves as the technical and digital backbone as transfer knowledge to the franchise partner is an example of how to solve franchisees’ e-commerce challenges. The rapidly changing e-commerce market has placed new demands on the franchisor to change shipping and handling from a store-only context to direct-to-consumer, incurring return and shipping costs.   The franchise partner gets access to an external ecosystem but also has some access to the franchisor’s internal system to a degree. As a result, this will change the company work. As an example, Company 3 is still determining how to develop partners’ values. Company 4 – Publicly owned Company 4 has no franchisees on the board. The board’s view on this is that the franchisee is in the business with another purpose. Company 4 board meetings do, however, include discussions on franchisee relations and the potential of collaboration. At every board meeting, a franchisee sentiment is discussed because the board has to be aware of what the franchisees feel about the business. Board members visit the stores in their official capacity in addition to visits from “mystery shoppers” who see how retail operations are run. Board members are recent private equity or former CEOs and most of the board members have a consumer background. The CEO is the only employee on the board and he can vote, while the CFO attends all meetings merely as a spectator. The CEO is in discussions, but at every board meeting session, members meet for a period of time without the CEO present, an important mechanism mandated in the corporate governance system. Company 4 seeks board members who understand franchising and have experience.  Summary Research Question 5 – The Board of Directors Our case-study companies have in common board on which franchisees often do not serve as members. Directors on these boards also share similar ideas about the role of franchisees, namely that they went into business with another purpose. Some of the companies do not even talk about the franchise partners at every board meeting. Only one of the firms uses a franchise sentiment at every board meeting as a governance mechanism, measuring the level of franchisees’ business state of mind. Clearly, one of the four case companies is thinking with a franchise governance focus at board meetings and throughout the system.  Findings Summary of empirical findings  Table 2 presents Company findings of the case companies. Table 2. Without exception, all the firms in this study apply contracts as a buffer between governance layers, signifying a relational governance view not only from that of the franchisor but also from the higher-order view of the board and owners. The four companies all share common denominators but differ in how they govern the business. One of our findings involves how they view their franchisees’ dependence on the ownership structure. They are all based on contracts but depending on the company ownership structure, they all view the franchisees differently. These firms also differ in why they use franchising. The cooperative company’s (Company 1) use of franchising is more a consequence than an intention. Company 1 uses franchising after having tested the model, then ended up with a franchise structure without a goal for the franchise business model or a system to govern it. The foundation company (Company 2) uses franchising because the founder decided to avoid the public market in order to diversify idiosyncratic risk and still maintain the control of the company. The family company (Company 3) chose to use franchising to expand in specific markets for legal reasons but seeks to govern franchisees by values. The publicly traded company (Company 4) uses franchising by heritage because it was founded by a franchisee that became the franchisor of the corporate-owned company in addition to the investors’ appetite for their franchise model. We attempt to clarify the domain of governance in franchising with the matrix in Figure 3. Contribution toward a typology of governance in franchising  Corporate governance affects a franchise system at different levels. Below, we show a typology based on our case interviews in Figure 3, which shows the companies’ different levels, degrees, and attitudes of ownership and governance. This connects to the external model in Figure 1, areas C and D, but adds new insight.   Figure 3. Degree of shareholder/owner involvement: Family Hi: In the family firm, the owner is normally active and a majority owner. Owners have a high level of impact. Cooperative Low: In the cooperative firm, the members/owners are passive and far away, represented by local sub-arranged co-ops with associations. Members/owners have low level of impact and members can always walk away.  Foundation Hi: In the foundation-owned firm, the owner is active and close to the firm. Owners have a high level of impact usually no other owners. Public Low: In the publicly traded firm, most owners/shareholders are far away and represented by passive mutual funds. Members/owners have a low level of impact. Degree of franchise firm governance: Family Low: When the family firm and owner (sometimes the CEO) are closer, there is a lower need for governance. Thus, a shorter distance between owner and management creates a lower degree of governance. Cooperative Low: When the cooperative firm and the owner (sometimes also the customer) are the members, they are often closer, lowering the need for governance. Thus, a shorter distance between owner/member and management creates a lower degree of governance. Foundation Hi: When access to the foundation and a high level of governance with a foundation owner sometimes far away with a long distance between owner and board creates high degree of governance. Public Hi: When access to external capital on the public market a high level of governance with a long distance between owner and management creates high degree of governance. Discussion In studies of corporate governance, Aguilera and Jackson (2010) examine the difference in corporate governance systems in different parts of the world. Corporate governance can be seen as governing corporations, governing the interaction between companies, and governing markets. Anglo-American governance has been a topic of study for nearly a century (Berle and Means 1932). Based on agency theory and the conflict of interest, Berle and Means (1932) note several fundamental problems, such as increased monitoring cost and reduced profitability. Should franchisees in global firms be on the board of directors? The franchisees normally do not vote on the board but they do presentations for the board about franchisee business and their sentiments. In governance, the separation of chairperson and CEO are different depending on the country. One way of thinking of franchisees on the board could be that of the German model, in which companies have employee representation. Should this, then, extend to franchisees, which have a capital interest in the firm, and even suppliers? Having employees and suppliers one step away from the owner may create a conflict of interest. If employees are on the board, for example, do they objectively look out for what is the best for the owners? Do franchise firms have a lower cost of capital and better credit ratings? Are independent ownership models that govern with the franchise model experiencing lower leverage and risk than firms not using this model? Is this perhaps a “capital redirection” interest when the owner of the franchisor can get fast streams of cash even when the business generates a great deal of cash? One example of this is one of the case companies’ initiative to refranchise thousands of stores, a commitment that could return billions in cash to the owners. If the franchisees are not owners, the strategy could prove difficult to execute given that this cash could have been reinvested into entrepreneurial owners and built the brand. The sale of the stores creates new types of both governance models in franchising. The use of new development licenses trades traditional franchisees for financial buyers that act as investment partners, a much different dynamic from the franchisees’ mere position as operational experts in the past. One especially interesting point is how we view the cooperative franchisee’s members’ demands for profitability and economic growth. The problem of ignorance and the dualism with the franchise cooperative cannot be seen from one side. The member interest is not a financial delivery but a good store without a regular consumer market this is an educational task (Holmstrom 1999; Hansmann 1988). The family franchise is certainly seeing the benefit of not hiring all the staff, and with the franchise model it does not manage human resources in franchise market areas. The franchise networks make no difference to the customer. Compared to other brands with a more standardized product retail system, this is much harder to control. The family franchise firm is doing this by training the partners through value-based steering. In this study, we have examined truly global franchise firms. Perhaps the problem for some firms is that franchising is not an intention but a consequence. There no strategic intention, therefore it is relatively undisputed how franchise companies rapidly unload and refranchise  because it speeds up capital returns.  Conclusions and future research  Our results imply that further investigation with larger and more diverse data sets is required. In future research, it would be interesting to test and measure the level of the relationship between a larger quantitative sample to see levels of variation in franchise governance and shareholder involvement. In this paper, we have explored and presented valuable content for analyzing and understanding the separation of ownership and control within franchise firm corporate governance. This study provided insights about governance in franchising from a higher-order corporate governance view. Additionally, further research could explore and add additional ownership types. The case study companies develop the notion of an “ownership disconnect.” This is new terminology for when a firm’s shareholders focus on results with one time horizon and investors in the public market have a completely different time frame for the investment. If a public market investor is focused on quarterly performance and the controlling family investor has a 30 to 50-year, or “forever,” perspective, this can increase the risk for governance issues and frustration, not to mention media pressure and bad press.   The business model itself is extremely profitable for some of the case companies. Historical research indicates that the main business method of franchising eventually would be corporate owned (Oxenfeldt and Kelly 1968). However, in this study we see something different, especially from the perspective of an investor that continues to invest in and like the franchise model. It would be a giant task to first staff the human resource organization and then the full retail network that would be needed were all the thousands of stores corporate owned and not franchised. A key finding of this paper is that franchising in practice is not an isolated corporate decision of an optimal franchise level that strategy researchers try to attain. Instead, the owners put demands on the franchising model for a higher or lower level of this mix.  PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS OF AUTHORITATIVE, CONTRACTUAL AND NORMATIVE CONTROL MECHANISMS The Case of Franchising  Ilir HajdiniDepartment of Business Administration University of Vienna Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria ilir.hajdini@univie.ac.atJosef WindspergerDepartment of Business Administration University of Vienna Oskar-Morgenstern-Platz 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria josef.windsperger@univie.ac.atPresented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 24-26, 2021      PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS OF AUTHORITATIVE, CONTRACTUAL AND NORMATIVE CONTROL MECHANISMS The Case of Franchising  Abstract The causes of performance in franchise networks have been overlooked. Thisarticleshows the impact of multiple control mechanisms on franchise system performance. We find that franchisors use authoritative, contractual, normative and equity control mechanisms to maintain chain uniformity, standardization and brand image. The primary data from Germany and Switzerland support our claims that bilateral forms of control enhance franchise systems` profitability and growth, while unilateral authoritative control diminishes performance. Equity control through higher proportion of company-owned outlets increases efficiency and coordination, but does not impact networks’ profitability.  Key words: authoritative control, contractual control, normative control, equity control, franchise system performance  Introduction  Business format franchising has been subject of investigation for long time because of its widespread application across different industries and economies (Heide, 1994; Dant et al., 2011). The franchisor ensues a business concept and initiates expansion mainly through franchisees’ resources who put trust on the future value of the franchisor’s brand, business model and capabilities to attract entrepreneurs and customers willing to pay. Franchisees commit specific investments to set up their outlets, pay upfront fees, engage in operation management of their businesses, and pay ongoing marketing and royalty fees. However, this partnership becomes cloudier when franchise networks span across industries and countries challenged by legally autonomous franchisee entrepreneurs with divergent goals and potentially opportunistic behavior (Barthélemy, 2008). In response, the franchisor has to use a series of control and incentive mechanisms to minimize such tensions and enhance network performance.  A large number of scholars have explored control issues in inter-organizational networks (e.g. Brown et al. 2003; Chalos and O'Connor 2004; Choi and Beamish 2004; Dant and Nasr 1998; Das and Teng 1998; Dekker 2004; Doherty and Alexander 2006; Gatignon and Anderson 1988; Geringer and Hebert 1989; Grewal et al. 2013; Jaussaud and Schaaper 2006; Glaser, Jirasek and Windsperger, 2020). However, they have still not provided a general theoretical foundation of control as major pillar of the governance structure of the firm (Liu et al. 2014). Most of the prior work identifies a broad range of control mechanisms (Mellewigt et al., 2011, Vázquez, 2008; Hajdini et al., 2017) including formal, informal and relational norms as means to exercise decision control in networks (Hunt and Nevin, 1974, Quinn 1999; Quinn and Doherty, 2000; Elango and Fried, 1997). Preceding studies are mainly qualitative in nature (Quinn, 1999; Quinn and Doherty, 2000; Doherty and Alexander, 2006), and show that several control mechanisms can be simultaneously used to govern franchise systems. However, there is a paucity of research that shows how the use of such control mechanisms influences the performance of franchise networks (e.g., Azevedo 2009; Doherty and Alexander 2006; Kerim et al, 2018; Mellewigt et al. 2011; Hajdini et al., 2017).   In this study, we apply the concept of control developed by Weitz and Jap (1995), who identify authoritative, contractual and normative control mechanisms depending on whether firms involved in interorganizational relationships participate in mutual or unilateral decision making. Authoritative control reflects the use of decision power by one firm to unilaterally control the activities of the other, while contractual and normative control represent a more bilateral use of power, mutual coordination, and trust among firms (Heide, 1994; Weitz and Jap, 1995). Besides, in franchising, the franchisor may choose to strategically use a dual ownership structure of “integration” through company-owned outlets and “non-integration” through franchised outlets (Baker et al. 2008). A higher proportion of company-owned outlets is used to increase coordination and control (Gillisa, Combs and Yind, 2020; Glaser et al., 2020). Hence, we extend the concept of Weitz and Jap (1995) to additionally investigate the performance effect of franchisor’s hierarchical/equity control in networks. Specifically, we aim to answer the following question: Which control mechanisms enhance network performance? Our study contributes to franchising literature by empirically showing the performance effect of authoritative, contractual, normative and equity control in franchise networks. Shedding light on this under-researched topic could help the franchisor sketch more supportive control design strategies and adopt policies to enhance network performance (Combs et al., 2004). We also contribute to a broader literature of interorganizational and entrepreneurial networks, which drawing from the agency and transaction cost theories, assumes that the franchisor (i.e. principal) and franchisees (i.e. agents) may intentionally pursue competing goals (Barney and Ouchi, 1986; Doherty and Quinn, 1999), and as a result emphasizes the role of contractual and hierarchical control to increase coordination efficiency and mitigate risks of opportunism (Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019; Williamson, 1981). Additionally, we add to two important research streams of strategic and organization management literature, which drawing from the resource based and relational theories, assume that franchise resources, organization competences (Barney, 1991; Combs et al., 2011) and trust-building transactions are of crucial importance to the long-lasting competitive advantage and firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Hence, we highlight that the franchisor’s control capabilities will result in higher network performance due to coordination and transaction cost saving as well as knowledge creation and trust properties of multiple control mechanisms (Heide, 1994; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001; Weitz and Jap, 1995). Nonetheless, the nature and extent of control may dependent on partners’ system-specific investments and knowhow (Gillis, et al., 2020, Hajdini et al., 2017). Therefore, while assessing the performance effect of different control mechanisms, we account for specific investments, resources/capabilities and relational bonds among franchise partners. We operationalize the specified measures using primary data instead of relying on proxy based secondary data, and consider the franchisors’ point of view instead of repeatedly relying on franchisees perspectives (Gillis et al., 2020). The paper is organized as follows: section two explores the literature review. Section three builds on the hypotheses related to the performance effect of all four control mechanisms in franchise systems. Section four presents the empirical analysis. Finally, we discuss the results and draw conclusions for theory and practice. Related literature and hypotheses Related literature and hypotheses One of the earliest studies in the field of franchise management identifies a couple of means to exercise decision control including coercive control (e.g. contract termination), and non-coercive control (e.g. trainings, assistance, rewards) (Hunt and Nevin, 1974). Both mechanisms are found to enhance firm performance either by reducing opportunistic behavior or leveraging knowledge transfer (Weitz & Jap, 1995; Kerim et al., 2018; Marjolein et al., 2010). For instance, Quinn (1999) and Quinn and Doherty (2000) show that both mechanisms complementarily improve franchise financial outcomes and relationships, but non-coercive mechanisms of control are preferred when franchisors lack experience and knowledge in their head offices. Another study shows, however, that non-coercive control is more frequently used by five out of six international fashion franchisors (Doherty and Alexander, 2006). Similarly, Marjolein et al. (2010) imply that administrative and relational means of control do reduce franchisees’ opportunism. Kerim et al (2018) show that organizational control in franchising facilitates knowledge transfer and even enhances innovations.  An instructive example that shows the consequences when firms use inadequate control mechanisms is that of Burger King Europe. In 2014, the giant fast food franchise network, announces a shutdown of 89 franchisees from a total of 700 restaurants in Germany. This decision was taken after an undercover report made by local media, which revealed that expired foods were relabeled as fresh and were kept warm for a long time instead of being grilled freshly. Further infractions revealed that sanitary standards were violated, and employee holiday payments and bonuses were squeezed. This led to negative effects on the franchisor’s brand reputation, sales, stakeholder trust, and stock prices. Similar examples of inadequate use of organizational control are repeatedly reported to have caused sever negative consequences in other franchise chains (e.g. one of McDonalds’ Chinese suppliers was found to have been selling expired meat Rf). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify the nature of and examine the possible effects of control mechanisms to use in order to prevent similar devastating performance consequences. A misfit in the use of different control mechanisms can either hamper the franchisor’s brand image and standardization or franchisees motivation for local adaptation (Kerim et al, 2018; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019).  Authoritative control The concept of authoritative control denotes the extent of franchisor’s authority to influence decisions over different value chain activities at the local outlets of franchisees (i.e. pricing, advertising, product and service, human resource management, procurement and supplier selection) (Weitz and Jap 1995; Mohr et al. 1996). This is similar to the concept of decision rights in organizational economics, which refers to the authority regarding deployment and use of the firm’s assets (Simon 1951; Hansman 1996). High authoritative control means that the franchisor’s headquarters have a high proportion of residual control over the value chain activities at the local outlets of the franchise system.  An instructive example that shows how using inadequate level of control is that of Burger King Europe. In 2014, the giant fast food franchise network, announces a shutdown of 89 franchisees from a total of 700 restaurants in Germany. This decision was taken after an undercover report made by local media, which revealed that expired foods were relabeled as fresh and were kept warm for a long time instead of being grilled freshly. Further infractions revealed that sanitary standards were violated, and employee holiday payments and bonuses were squeezed. This led to negative effects on the franchisor’s brand reputation, sales, stakeholder trust, and stock prices. Therefore, a misfit in the use of control can either hamper the franchisor’s brand image and standardization or franchisees motivation for local adaptation (Kerim et al, 2018; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019).  In the Burger King case, too much autonomy, might have resulted in opportunism and other agency problems diluting franchisors’ brand equity and its ability to operate (Dant and Gundlach, 1999). In response, more franchisor authoritative control in Burger King’s value chain activities of product/service decisions, human resource management, and procurement, could have prevented the scandal. For instance, Hajdini and his colleagues (2017) show that more franchisor authoritative control strengthens the positive performance effect of intangible assets, and weakens the negative performance effect of uncertainties. Doherty and Alexander (2006) find that franchisees ask for more franchisor control under conditions of business uncertainty. On the other hand, Dant and Gundlach (1999) argue that an extensive centralization of control authority may be detrimental to franchisees’ motivation. Hayek (1935, 1940) highlights that decision authority can be efficiently centralized only if the central planer has location and time specific knowledge. Similarly, March and Simon (1958) argue that as the amount of information-processing capabilities of CEOs are limited, decision authority should be delegated (see also Van Zandt, 1999). Furthermore, Weitz and Jap (1995) argue that franchisors gain strategic advantages as they shift from authoritative types of control to more contractual and normative cooperation types of control. Similarly, Aghion and Tirole (1997) point out that the principal can increase agent’s motivation to participate in contractual relationships if it delegates authority over activities important to the agent. This results in more motivation for franchisees to react promptly and exchange the obtained local market knowledge with franchisors (Sorensen and Sorensen, 2001; Windsperger, 2004). Hence, the following alternative hypotheses can be formulated:  H1a: The franchisor that exercises more authoritative control (on value chain activities) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H1b: The franchisor that exercises more authoritative control (on value chain activities) experiences lower franchise system performance. Contractual control  Stinchcombe (1985) notes that when hierarchies are flattened to more network-like organizations, authority can be exercised through contractual clauses. Similarly, Weitz and Jap (1995) proclaim that franchise networks rely more often on bilateral forms of contractual and normative control mechanisms. Contractual control can be exercised through clauses that include dealing, territorial, tying, RPM, call option, leasing, alienation, and non-competition clauses (Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). More specifically, contracts can specify franchise partners’ geographic territory within which the franchisees can operate or within which the franchisor abstains from operating. This has shown to prevent free riding externalities and improve the quality of available services (Lafontaine and Slade, 2014; Zanarone, 2009). Similarly, the contractual clauses of tying and dealing that authorize the franchisee to acquire the raw material from franchisor’s appointed suppliers and sell only brand-related products can influence the set and quality of products available to consumers (Marvel, 1982). For instance, the dealing clause can facilitate the promotion of individual brands (Chen, 2012), increase brand-related and market sales (Sass, 2005), and lowers distributor costs (Asker, 2004). Moreover, the resale price maintenance, which restricts franchisees to maximum prices they can charge, can prevent high-profit margins or the so-called double marginalization problem (Rey and Verge, 2008). Further, the franchisor’s leasing of physical premises to franchisees provides the franchisor with more decision control over its franchisees safeguarding franchisor’s transaction specific investments and allowing franchisees to overcome resource scarcities (Lashley and Rowson, 2002). Thus, the exercised level of control via contractual restraints can play a positive role in determining the relationship among franchise partners, and thereby the performance of franchise networks (Dutta, Heide, & Bergen, 1999; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019).  In franchising, although the franchisor might establish the contractual terms (e.g. contractual restraints) and communicate them to franchisees, the process of contractual design is in the sense bilateral as both parties can accept or negotiate changes (Weitz and Jap, 1995). Hence, assuming that contractual terms are cooperatively designed and agreed upon by the franchise partners, they should serve to align partner objectives and increase efficiency (Weitz and Jap, 1995; Lafontaine and Slade, 2014). Nonetheless, some scholars show that extensive control exercised via such restraints might negatively influence the performance of franchise networks. For instance, Heide and Dutta (1998) argue that some companies may be discouraged from using exclusive dealing as they impose searching costs on end users (customers). Further, Grimes (1999) suggests that tying arrangements allow franchisors to potentially collude with their vendors (selected suppliers) to increase prices of inputs/raw materials to their franchisees for a rebate that the vendor could then pay to the franchisor. Franchisors could also demand higher prices for the tied supplies relative to alternatives that franchisees could find on the market. Similarly, territorial exclusivity might protect negligent or opportunistic franchisees from competition, who could in turn damage the franchisor’s brand reputation and slow down the overall sales by reducing service quality, or increasing prices (Smith, 1982). Likewise, according to Adams and Jones (1997, p. 260), leasing clauses can make the franchisee reluctant to make outlet specific investments as they could more easily be displaced by the franchisor. Finally, as the explicit call option clause provides the franchisor the legal right to potentially acquire its franchisees at low prices while retaining their strategic locations (Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019), this clause may demotivate franchisees to make outlet specific investments.  Accordingly, the following alternative hypotheses can be formulated:  H2a: The franchisor that exercises more contractual control (via contractual restraints) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H2b: The franchisor that exercises more contractual control (via contractual restraints) experiences lower franchise system performance.  Normative control  Normative control is exercised bilaterally as both franchise partners continuously influence and adhere to relationship norms, which are not discreet, but evolve over time through repeated interactions (Weitz and Jap, 1995). This mechanism accounts for the role of the relational norms such as trustworthiness (Lado, Dant and Tekleb, 2008), which has shown to play a vital role in sustaining channel relationships (Gulati, 1995; Heide and John, 1992; Macneil, 1983; Thorgren and Wincent, 2011; Uzzi, 1997). As contracts cannot specify all contingencies, governance through informal mechanisms can reduce opportunism, mitigate transaction costs and increase satisfaction (Reuer and Arino, 2007). Indeed, the earlier findings of Hunt and Nevin (1974) show that franchisees’ satisfaction is increased with normative sources of decision control. Similarly, latter studies present that when partners make mutual decisions based on trustful relations, this can improve the level of franchisee-compliant behaviors (Davies et al, 2011; Dickey et al., 2008), increases franchisee satisfaction (Dickey et al., 2008), and dilute agency costs (Cochet et al., 2008). This suggests that normative control that enforces shared norms based on managerial support, trainings and mutual trust from successive collaborations among franchise partners, increases mutual understanding about each-others’ managerial expectations, organizational cultures, and operations (Gulati, 1995) leading to more favorable outcomes. Hence, using normative control based on experienced-based trust developed through successive interactions lessens the potential monitoring costs, post-contract litigations, and dispute resolutions improving the performance of the overall network.  However, relying extensively on normative control assuming that partners are going to behave in compliance with the overall franchisor goals may be unrealistic according to agency theory proponents (Barney and Ouchi, 1986; Eisenhardt, 1989). Such a practice might signal lack of concern and lack of managerial capability of the franchisor, and thereby undermine franchisor’s role and brand (Doherty and Alexander 2006; Hajdini et al, 2017). Further, the use of normative control to establish long-term partner relationships may be costly due to perceived uncertainties that one of the partners may not realize the expected risk-adjusted-returns or that it may not be able to appropriate the deserved share of returns (Weitz and Jap, 1995). This may be due to changing environmental uncertainties, partners’ potential opportunism or bounded rationality to assess correctly the share contribution of each partner generated from their idiosyncratic investments (Williamson, 1975, 1991). As a result, franchise partners may focus on such possible outcomes overlooking the potential value from joint collaboration and investments. Hence, we formulate the following alternative hypotheses: H3a: The franchisor that exercises more normative control (via successive trustworthy collaborations) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H3b: The franchisor that exercises more normative control (via successive trustworthy collaborations) experiences lower franchise system performance. Equity control  Franchisor’s equity control is exercised through an increase in the franchisor’s proportion of company-owned outlets (Glaser et al., 2020). The franchisor can decide to increase the proportion of owned outlets nearby its franchisees (or near the exclusive territories of its franchisees) for several reasons. First, this may help reduce information asymmetries with local markets (e.g., Gillis et al., 2020) allowing the franchisor to understand the amount of local demand for standardized services and new products, and b) customer reactions subsequent to new pricing or advertising strategies. Further, this might alleviate franchisees’ tendencies to potentially under-report sales’ revenues, which may serve as the bases to specifying the amount of ongoing royalties they need to pay to their franchisors. Additionally, higher equity control allows the maintenance of certain quality standard by the franchisor’s owned outlets, which in turn may mitigate franchisees’ potential free-riding practices (Grossman and Hart, 1986), who in absence of franchisor’s presence, may engage in fierce price competition to later end up offering low quality products and services under the assumption that the associated costs from unmet customer expectations would be borne by all franchisees of the same brand in the same region (i.e. free-riding).      Nonetheless, it has been shown that franchisees are more innovative than employees of company-owned outlets to respond more promptly and adequately to changing customers tastes as franchisees’ income is tightly related to their business activities (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Therefore, an extensive level of equity control might result in high transaction and agency costs partly descending from weak incentives of company-owned managers, whose income is tightly related to their monthly wages. Hence, company-owned managers may exaggerate their efforts and performance to attract the franchisor’s attention or follow other than the franchisor’s objectives, thereby imposing slow decision making and high monitoring costs (Bradach, 1997; Rubin, 1978). Further, it is shown that higher franchisees’ entrepreneurial autonomy increases local market know-how generation (Kerim et al., 2018) and reduces litigation costs and contract terminations (López-Fernández and López-Bayón, 2018). Consequently, an extensive integration to exercise equity control at the expense of franchisees’ autonomy may humper the entrepreneurial spirit and innovations in franchise networks (Kerim et al, 2018, Windsperger, 2004).  Accordingly, two alternative hypotheses can be formulated:  H4a: The franchisor that exercises more equity control (via higher proportion of franchisor-owned outlets) experiences higher franchise system performance.  H4b: The franchisor that exercises more equity control (via higher proportion of franchisor-owned outlets) experiences lower franchise system performance.  Empirical Analysis  Data Collection To test these hypotheses, we collected the data from franchise systems in Germany and Switzerland. Prior to data collection, we refined and improved the questionnaire following several interviews that we conducted with franchise professionals from the respective franchise associations. Twenty five franchisors participated in the final modification process. They suggested that to ensure a more confident level of knowledge about the franchise partners, questionnaires should aim at respondents with a minimum number of years of inter-organizational experience and a minimum network size (e.g. number of outlets). Thus, we decided that any franchise system selected should have started franchising at least two years prior to the study and should have at least five operating outlets to be considered a useful observation. Correspondingly, out of all the systems listed by the German Franchise Federation and the Swiss Franchise Association, the questionnaire was mailed to 667 German and Swiss franchise systems. We send the questionnaires to senior managers who were considered responsible for franchise expansion, based on their expertise and relevance to the subject under investigation (McKendall & Wagner III 1997). We chose a quantitative approach using a standardized questionnaire, which was sent out by email and by postal mail. The choice of an online survey offers various advantages over an offline survey. Using an online survey results in lower costs of data collection and analysis and enables accessibility to a greater number of participants. At the same time, various participants may take part in the survey, extending the geographic scope of the random sample. The main disadvantages of online surveys relate to the considerable loss of control over the execution of the survey. Researchers cannot be sure who filled in the questionnaire, therefore it is hard to reassess the effect of say equity control on performance related archival data. The number of questionnaires returned was 170, representing a response rate of close to 29 percent from Germany and 17 percent from Switzerland. However, due to missing values, 143 responses could be used in this study.  We also assessed the likelihood of non-response bias by comparing the results obtained from late to early respondents. The ANOVA test revealed no significant difference between the two respondent groups (Armstrong & Overton, 1977). The late respondents served as proxies for non-respondents and included those who completed the questionnaire four weeks after the first group of respondents. Further, the common method variance (CMV) was tested by conducting a single factor analysis of the items of all subjective measures, which revealed six distinct factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1.0. The first component explains 27.2 percent of the variance, while all of them taken together explain 64.8 percent (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). Thus, Harman’s single-factor test negates the possibility of confounded interpretations, since no factor accounts for most of the variance. We still used several additional techniques as suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2003) to minimize the CMV risk. We used different anchors and scales for the dependent and independent survey items. The dependent variable of performance and two independent survey items (authoritative and normative control) were derived using seven-point Likert with differing anchors (1= very low influence, 7 – very high influence, and from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree), while one additional independent variable was derived using binary questions (contractual control), and the final variable was derived asking the franchisors to fill the number of owned and franchised outlets they licensed (for more details on construct composition and variable operationalization, please regard the subsequent sub-section). We finally included a two-item measure to test for possible social desirability of franchisors' proclivity to potentially give biased answers. Measures Dependent Variable The performance of the franchise system is measured by subjective indicators since the majority of franchise systems do not disclose objective (financial) information. Further, scholars have attempted to assess and compare subjective and objective indicators finding a high level of correlation between them (Geringer & Hebert 1991; Glaister & Buckley 1998; Wall et al. 2004). Nonetheless, the approach to derive single item and objective measures to capture the multidimensionality of firm performance has been questioned (Richard et al., 2009). As a result, we asked franchisors to assess the extent to which they achieved the following system goals last year: system growth, revenue increases, profit increases, savings in coordination, control and administrative costs, alignment of products and services to customer needs, and effectiveness in coordination between head-office and outlets (Hajdini & Windsperger, 2019). The responses were assessed on a seven-point scale (1= very low influence, 7 – very high influence). To assess whether the mentioned items load on different performance constructs, we apply exploratory factor analysis. Following varimax rotation, two factors were retained as their corresponding eigenvalues exceeded one. The principal components factor analysis are presented in table 1: Insert Table 1 The two retained factors explained 63 percent of variance. Communalities exceed the threshold level of 0.50 with the exception of one item (alignment of products and services to customer needs). This indicates that that the two factors capture a significant portion of the variance. The internal consistency of franchise system profitability and growth and of franchise system efficiency are above the recommended cut-off value of Cronbach alpha: 0.86 and 0.78 respectively (Cronbach, 1951). Independent Variables Authoritative control represents the allocation of decision-making authority between franchisor and franchisees. The variable assessed on a seven-point scale (1= very low influence, 7 – very high influence) captures the extent of the franchisor’s influence on operational decisions regarding the selection of suppliers, resale price, advertising, product/service offering, equipment and procurement decisions, new product decisions, and application of accounting and controlling systems (Windsperger, 2004). The control variable was constructed by averaging the scale values, which vary between 1 and 7. The higher the franchisor’s influence on residual decision-making in the network, the higher the index of the authoritative control. Contractual control represent the degree of contractual restraints used in franchise contracts (i.e. exclusive territory, exclusive dealing, tying and non-competition arrangements, resale price maintenance, lease control, real option and alienation rights). Franchisors were asked to indicate whether they use restraint clauses in their contracts (1 if yes, 0 otherwise). Thus, the operationalization of this measure follows that used by Parkhe (1993) and Reuer and Arino (2007), where different types of franchise contractual restraints are arrayed in increasing order of strength or severity to arrive at a global measure that represents the degree of franchise contractual control used. Contractual control stringency is derived using the following weighting scheme:   (1) CC (weighted) =        where CC represents the degree of used contractual control in franchising,  equals  if the th restraint is employed, and zero if not (Parkhe, 1993). That is, equals one if the first restraint is used (two if the second is used) and zero otherwise. The sum ranges between 0 and 36, which when divided by 36, yields values between 0 and 1. In other words, when CC equals 1, contractual control is high because all eight contractual restraint clauses are used. For further details regarding the use of restrictive contractual clauses, view table 2: Insert Table 2 Normative control can be exercised through trust built from repeated relational exhanges. Previous postive and repeated exhanges between franchise partners enhances mutual trust, which is essential to reduce the threat ofopportunism and encourage exchange of information, coordination, and cooperation (Das and Teng, 2004; Gulati et al., 2012; Weitz & Jap, 1995). Franchise partners are therefore ready to rely more on normative control and less on other mechanisms of control. Adapted from Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) and Dyer and Chu (2000), we asked franchisors to rate the following four items (1= strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree) with respect to the quality of relationships they have with their franchisees: There is great degree of sucessive trustworthy cooperation between ourselves and our franchisees, the cooperation with our franchisees is based on partnership basis, there is an atmosphere of openness and honesty between us and our franchisees, and the exchange of information between us and our franchisees goes beyond the agreed scope. The higher the construct’s index, the higher the level of normative control (Weitz and Jap, 1995).  Equity control is calculated by the number of company-owned outlets divided by thetotal number of outlets in all respective countries (in our case: Germany and Switzerland). The franchisor was asked to provide with the number of outlets they own and license. This approach has been derived and operationalized in a similar fashion by prior scholars (Glaser et al., 2020; Windsperger and Dant. 2006). ONTROL ARIABLES To control for possible confounders, we initially control for size, which represents the total number of franchised and company-owned outlets. Smaller firms might lack the necessary resources and capabilities to use different control mechanisms (Reuer and Arino, 2007). From a transaction cost theoretical perspective, larger firms should have a higher control capacity (Erramilli and Rao, 1993). The size of franchising systems is measured by the log number of total number of outlets. Similarly, older firms (age) should have higher financial capital as well as more capacity employ control mechanisms and inter-organizational learning. As time passes, there is a tendency of grwoing experience with established practices and routines that may raise efficiency and performance levels of franchise systmes (Sorenson & Sørensen 2001). The age of franchising systems is measured by the log number of years since the first opened thier first franchise outlet. We further control for the initial fees, and ongoing royalty fees found in franchise contractual agreements. The literature predicts that the structure of these fees can affect the franchise system performance as they can determine the way the joint profit is shared between the franchise partners as well as indirectly affect the way the joint targets are set (e.g. sales, retail prices, advertising etc.) (Rey and Verge, 2008). Next, we also use contract duration, which influences franchise network performance, because the longer the contracts, the higher the likelyhood that franchisees can reimburse their relationship-specific investments (Joskow, 1987; Brickley et al., 2006; Crocker and Masten, 1988). This sugessts that shorter contract durations provides the option not to renew non-performing franchisee contracts. We next control for franchisor’s system-specific know-how, which includes its knowledge in site selection, store layout, product development, and procurement (Kacker, 1988). Finally, we account for the the franchisee’s local market know-how, which include its marketing, human resource, quality control, as well as innovation capabilities (Hall, 1993; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001) that can influence the franchise system performance due to the fact that they cannot be easily transferred and acquired by the franchisor or other franchise partners.  Empirical Results We initially report descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients. Table 3 shows that the mean of franchise system profitability ( ̅x = 4.2) is on average relatively lower than that of franchise system efficiency ( ̅x = 4.5), and that there is a strong positive association between the two categories of franchise system performance. Surprisingly, initial fees and royalties show no association with franchise system performance measures, but more with other variables. Further, we tested for possible multicollinearity, however, the low variance inflation factors (VIF range between 1.20 and 1.69) indicate that multicollinearity does not affect the results of our analysis.    Insert Table 3 To test the hypotheses regarding the impact of authoritative, contractual, normative and equity control on franchise system performance (i.e. profitability and system efficiency), we carried out seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) (Zellner, 1962). This provides a way to capture the influence of multiple information sources and outcomes using several equations, and accounts for contemporaneous correlations while estimating the parameters of franchise system profitability and franchise system efficiency simultaneously. This results in greater efficiency of the parameter estimates by controlling for correlation among error terms across franchise system performance equations (Zellner, 1962). The SUR analysis shows a significant correlation in the error terms across franchise system profitability and growth and franchise system efficiency equations. The Breusch-Pagan test shows that the application of SUR is a preferred estimation method since it rejects the null hypothesis that the error terms are independent (i.e., all estimation models show that χ^2 are significant at p p<0.000). The results of multivariate seemingly unrelated regressions are presented in table 4a and table 4b.   Insert Table 4a Insert Table 4b We find support for the alternative proposition (H1b), namely that higher franchisor authoritative control will negatively influence the franchise system performance. We find support for this prediction in all estimation models irrespective of whether we use control variables or regress authoritative control on both dimensions of performance alone. Table 4b shows the latter case in which we additionally assess step-by-step the individual effect of all hypothesized predictors on both dimensions of franchise system performance. Further, the data provide support to the next hypotheses of H2a and H3a inferring that contractual and normative control mechanisms do positively influence the franchise systems’ profitability and growth and franchise systems’ efficiency. This indicates that franchisors that use contractual and normative control methods (e.g. via using important contractual restraint clauses, and non-coercive control means of trust nurturing) to govern franchise activities, save coordination control and administrative costs, grow faster and generate higher revenues and higher profits. Finally, equity control through higher proportion of owned outlets does not show to influence the franchise systems’ profitability and growth with minor influence on franchise systems’ efficiency (table 4a, model 12). This indicates that cost savings from coordination control and administrative activities can be obtained from higher ownership stakes, but not systems’ profitability.  Table 4a shows that we examine whether the hypotheses are supported when using a rich number of franchise related control variables to minimize the potential confounder effects of other than the hypothesized predictors. We controlled for the effect of franchise systems age, size, initial and royalty fees, contract duration, franchisor’s system specific know-how, and franchisees local market know-how, which otherwise cannot be captured. If one tracks the repeating pattern of significance effects through all estimation models in table 4a, it is evident that larger franchise systems, those that perceive that they possess system specific know-how, and those that issue longer contracts to their franchisees enjoy higher performance levels. To our surprise, systems that cooperate with more skilled local franchisees seem to suffer from lower efficiency (but not from lower levels of profitability and growth). This may be due to the fact that innovative franchisees may increase franchisor’s monitoring and other coordination costs (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Table 4b provides additional evidence that the effects of the hypothesized predictors on performance dimensions of franchise systems are still evident even if one does not control for firm characteristics. Discussion Franchising nurtures an entrepreneurial environment for rapid expansion (Shane, 1996), while at the same time exposes franchise partners to opportunism that can degrade the common brand (Michael, 2000, Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). This raises questions about the nature of control mechanisms that some franchisors can use to maintain service uniformity and incentivize local adaptation. However, virtually nothing is known about how authoritative, contractual, normative or equity control dimensions individually or collectively relate to franchisor performance (Combs et al., 2011; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). This study addresses this research deficit by empirically showing not only the importance of distinguishing between multiple control alternatives in future inquiry, but also by differentiating between two dimensions of franchise system performance (i.e. efficiency and profitability/growth) and demonstrating how certain control mechanisms are selected over others to enhance franchise system performance. As advantages of franchising result mainly from its ability to exercise decision control (Heide, 1994; Stump & Heide, 1996; Weitz & Jap, 1995), our results show that franchisor’s authoritative control is contra-productive for the efficiency, profitability and growth of franchise systems. This may be due to several reasons including the growing strategic importance of franchisees to local knowledge creation and transfer (Windsperger, 2004). Franchisees’ autonomy with respect to supplier and equipment selection or product and procurement decisions is important to enhance customer responsiveness and innovations in networks (Kerim et al, 2018). However, we find that more equity control through higher proportion of owned outlets may lead to slight improvements in system’s efficiency, while bilateral forms of contractual and normative means to exercise decision control lead to higher system efficiency, profitability and growth.  Consistent with our theoretical conception of franchisor’s control capabilities, the findings demonstrate that the majority of control mechanisms, with the exception of authoritative control, can serve as transaction cost saving (Williamson 1975, 1985) and value-creation and relational-catalyst mechanisms (Barney 1991; Madhok 1996) as they facilitate knowledge transfer and mitigate appropriation and coordination cost concerns (Gulati and Singh 1998; Dekker 2004; Gulati et al. 2012). Specifically, consistent with the resource-based and relational governance perspectives, we highlight that using normative control to transfer system-knowhow and absorb local market knowhow, while exercising control of franchisee activities through contractual restraints, will enable the franchisor to generate relationship-specific rents by exploiting synergies in the franchise network (Dyer and Singh, 1998; Weitz and Jap, 1995). Both mechanisms of contractual and normative control have an additional important knowledge leverage function enhancing firm-specific resources and capabilities (Madhok, 1997; March, 1991) and hence increasing the overall network performance (Azoulay, and Shane, 2001). These strategies of exercising control possess additional coordination and safeguarding functions as they define roles, incentives and responsibilities and discourage franchisees from potential opportunism (Hajdini and Windpserger, 2019). This suggests that the franchisor will use a control level that considers the trade-off between the performance-enhancing effect of contractual and normative control mechanisms, and the performance-diminishing effect of authoritative control mechanisms. While we expected that contractual and normative control could spur the franchisor’s efficiency, profitability and growth, we also expected that equity and authoritative control could enhance both dimensions of the franchisor’s performance. One reason we did not find a stronger relationship between equity control and franchisor profitability/growth may be that managers of franchisor-owned outlets are less apt to generate entrepreneurial local know-how that sufficiently aid flexibility, and creation and diffusion of knowledge across the whole network outlets (El Akremi et al., 2011, Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001).  The study may offer additional impetus to alliance management capabilities research (e.g., Schilke and Goerzen, 2010; Schreiner et al., 2009) because it emphasizes the role of multiple control mechanism that franchisors develop to monitor and incentivize franchisees to joint-value creation and performance enhancement (Combs et al., 2011) something that the alliance literature has overlooked to mainly describe management capabilities and routines that improve  relationship quality of partners (Gillis, et al., 2020). In this line, future franchise studies may also examine the influence of multiple control mechanisms on partner relationship quality, conflicts and innovations.  In sum, we offer new insights to the literature of franchising by responding to recent calls for deeper investigation of managerial control as the major pillar of the governance structure of the firm (Combs et al., 2011; Dant and Grünhagen, 2014; Dant et al., 2011; Hajdini et al., 2017; Liu et al. 2014; Zhao et al., 2004).  Implications of limitations for future inquiry We have to acknowledge that our study has some limitations that have implications for future research. First, although we have derived primary data from franchisors with questionnaires designed specifically for the research question, our study is cross-sectional, which reinforces the need to develop and test our claims with secondary data. More observations that could span into the past could alleviate concerns of endogeneity and provide more information for sectorial/industrial effects. For example, the symbiosis perspective indicates that one advantage of franchisor outlet ownership is that it gives the franchisor more market information, which can assist personnel training and increase standardization (Bradach, 1997), both of which may be important for franchise systems with mobile customers (Brickley and Dark, 1987) and for those systems that depend on brand advertising (Lafontaine and Shaw, 2005) (e.g., retailing or fast food franchise systems), however, contractual and normative control may be more appropriate for franchise systems that need to locally adapt to customer needs (e.g., consulting or real estate franchise systems). Hence, adopting a systemic approach that investigates the role of local cultures, and the role of business and corporate franchisor strategies to using multiple control mechanisms might be a fruitful avenue for future scholars.  Second, while our findings pertain generally to whether franchise firms use one of the multiple control modes, they do not deal with different ways franchising is implemented, such as through area development, multi-unit or master franchising. Although we did not find any evidence that multi-unit franchising impacts performance, and that this could be more evident in international franchising, this or other franchising entry and governance modes could influence franchise management controlling capabilities and relatedly franchisor performance (Jell-Ojober and Windsperger, 2014). Third, while our measures are subjective in nature given that most franchise chains are privately held and do not publicly disclose information (Combs et al., 2011), future scholars might find indirect ways to investigate governance relationships among public franchise systems, a sub-set of population that may or may not represent the much larger population of smaller in size privately-owned franchise chains (Madanoglu et al., 2011). Finally, while we account for the resources/capabilities and relational bonds among franchise partners assessing the performance effect of different control machinimas, future scholars might find that certain mechanisms can have mediating or moderating effects on network performance contingent on the expertise or knowledge of franchise partners (Hajdini et al., 2017).  Conclusion  Given that franchising grows through a network of distant and independent entrepreneurs, it exposes its brand to risks of free-riding. As a result, the franchisor faces challenges related to the strategic design and use of multiple control mechanisms. Designing contracts that restrict and guide the partnership with respect to dealing, territorial exclusivity, resale price maintenance or tying is one way to alleviate free-riding and maintain standardization. While, authoritative control on different value chain activities of the franchisees shows to hinder performance, exercising normative control through successive trustworthy collaboration is another important alternative to enhance both dimensions of franchisor performance (i.e. efficiency, and profitability/growth). An additional approach to increase equity control through a higher proportion of franchisor-owned outlets has shown to marginally, but still increase one dimension of franchisor performance (e.g. savings in administrative, coordination and control costs). Therefore, we portrayed four franchise control mechanisms that illustrate some important governance routines and provided evidence that they serve as an important approach to network management and franchisor performance. Further, we demonstrate that the distinction between performance dimensions as well as multiple control dimensions is an important contribution to the practice and theory of franchising. This approach moves away from rather restrictive focus on singular control dimension toward a view that embraces the use of multiple control strategies to govern hybrid structures of franchise firms. Our hope is that this research offers a small step toward describing the control dimensions that franchisors can use to enhance their capabilities in working with local franchisee-entrepreneurs and enhance the performance of the overall chain.

Multi-brand franchisees (MBFs) are franchisees who operate outlets within more than one franchise chain. The presence of this phenomenon seems to challenge most of the established theoretical arguments in franchising, especially those emerging from power-dependence and agency theories. In our attempt to enhance our understanding of this complex, emergent phenomenon, we argue that an appropriate theoretical perspective for explaining this phenomenon is one that, prima facie, appears to clash with it the most – agency theory. So, we use agency theory in an integrated mode – one that utilizes the full capacity of the theory and in which both components of the theory (the motivation problem and the ability problem) coexist and involve a tradeoff. Drawing on this integrated, dynamic agency theory perspective, we advance the “ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis” as a theoretical explanation for the emergence of multi-brand franchisees.

One of the primary economic intuitions behind franchising is to allow the franchisor to achieve the outcomes of vertical integration through contractual vertical restraints without the need to own the entire channel, and to convince end-users that they are buying from the manufacturer when, in fact, they are dealing with a separately-owned enterprise (Stern et al., 1996). This channel structure results in a franchise chain consisting of a centralized principal (franchisor) and a group of decentralized agents (franchisees) within which there is a clear contractual distribution of rights and responsibilities.  LITERATURE REVIEW AND GAP IDENTIFICATION Franchising is a ubiquitous form of distribution and a part of consumers’ everyday life in almost every B2C sector all around the globe. About one-third of all retail sales in the U.S. move across franchise chains and this proportion is growing (e.g., Luxenberg, 1985; Mathewson & Winter, 1985; Dicke, 1992). Franchising accounts for over $1 trillion in annual sales and constitutes 17% of the United States’ GDP (Gillis et al., 2014). This ontological omnipresence is matched by a well-deserved amount of scholarly attention to the phenomenon that has resulted in a substantial body of knowledge traversing various disciplines such as entrepreneurship (e.g., Hoy & Shane, 1998; Bates, 1998; Gillis et al., 2014; Gassenheimer, 1996; Barthélemy, 2011), economics (e.g., Bhattacharyya & Lafontaine, 1995; Lafontaine, 1992; Martin, 1988; Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004; Blair & Lafontaine, 2005; Klein & Saft, 1985), finance (e.g., Klein, 1995; Brickley & Dark, 1987;  Lutz, 1995; Lafontaine & P a g e  | 4 Bhattacharyya, 1995; Norton, 1995), accounting (e.g., Campbell & Sandino, 2009; Price, 1999), strategic management (e.g., Ater & Rigbi, 2015; Combs & Ketchen, 2003; Norton, 1988; Michael, 2000; Perryman & Combs, 2012), and marketing (e.g., Hunt & Nevin, 1975; Agrawal, & Lal, 1995; Weaven & Frazer, 2003; Srinivasan, 2006; Windsperger & Dant, 2006). This interdisciplinary interest in franchising has led to the development of a rich, encompassing, and mature body of literature that covers most aspects of the phenomenon exhaustively: from the economic rationale underlying franchising (e.g., Combs & Ketchen, 2003; Knight, 1986; Norton, 1988; Lal, 1990; Lafontaine & Bhattacharyya, 1995; Lafontaine, 1992; Combs & Ketchen, 1999; Lafontaine & Kaufmann, 1994; Scott, 1995), to contracting in franchising (e.g., Agrawal & Lal, 1995; Brickley et al., 2006; Lafontaine & Bhattacharyya, 1995; Lafontaine & Shaw, 1999; Windsperger & Dant, 2006; Brickley et al., 2006; Rubin, 1978 ), to plural forms of governance in franchising (e.g., Bradach, 1997; Kidwell & Nygaard, 2011; Gillis et al., 2014; Dant et al., 2008; Bürkle & Posselt, 2008), to international franchising (e.g., Fladmoe-Lindquist, K., 1996; Welsh et al., 2006; Shane, 1996), to other emerging areas such as technology and innovation adoption in franchise chains (O'callaghan et al., 1992; Paswan & Wittmann, 2009).  One of the research areas in franchising that has attracted an ample amount of recent scholarly attention, is the phenomenon of multi-unit franchising. Multi-unit franchisees (MUF) are those who operate more than one unit (outlet) in the franchise chain (Dant et al., 2013). Franchisees become MUF by either acquiring other franchisees or by being granted an area development agreement under which they have the right to a certain geographic territory. The reason that multi-unit franchising stood out as a relatively intriguing phenomenon is that it defies one of the established theoretic underpinnings of franchising theory – the agency theoretic explanation of franchising. In this regard, Kalnins and Lafontaine (2004) argue that from an agency theory perspective, multi-unit franchising can be seen as an ‘anomaly’ for the following reasons: (a) the agency theory rationale for franchising is that owner-operators have less incentive to shirk. Hence, when a franchisor allocates multiple units to a franchisee, P a g e  | 5 that franchisee will not have the same level of involvement in day-to-day operations as in the case of single unit franchising and will be relying on agents (managers); (b) a set of single-unit franchisees will collectively have more incentive than a multi-unit franchisee; (c) when a single-unit franchisee becomes a multi-unit franchisee, he will have more bargaining power vis-à-vis the franchisor which can increase his opportunistic behavior. This questioning of the agency theoretic logic for franchising, as well as other theoretic explanations such as the power-dependence theory and the entry-deterrence argument (Hadfield, 1991), compelled many researchers to delve into the phenomenon of MUF which resulted in a substantial stack of academic literature on the subject (e.g., Kaufmann & Dant, 1996; Jindal, 2011; Bradach, 1995; Dant et al., 2013; Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004).  While attempting to reconcile what Bradach (1995) calls “chains within chains” or what Dant et al. (2013) call “mini-hierarchies within the franchise hierarchy” (i.e. MUF) with franchising theory, researchers largely overlooked an arguably more challenging and interesting phenomenon: multi-brand franchisees involving franchisees who operate outlets within more than one franchise chain (MBFs). The unresolved question here is that if researchers were intrigued by the presence of “chains within chains” or “mini-hierarchies within the hierarchy”, why have they largely overlooked what we would call “chains across chains” orchains-spanning hierarchies,” if we were to follow the Bradach and Dant analogies presented earlier? One possible reason is that MBFs may have a more long standing and visible presence in emerging markets than in developed markets where much of the scholarly research in franchising is conducted. That being said, even the international franchising literature is relatively silent on this phenomenon -- with rare exceptions such as Grünhagen et al. (2020). MBFs tend to be large business groups holding several franchises that are sometimes close substitutes or even direct competitors -- some American MBFs (e.g., Kazi Management VI LLC., Boddie-Noell Enterprises Inc., Pilot Travel Centers LLC., and Doherty Enterprises Inc.) hold more than 20 units of directly competing franchises such as Burger King, KFC, and Taco Bell). In this article, we try to scratch the surface of P a g e  | 6 this under-researched phenomenon by providing some exploratory theoretic insights. In doing so, we attempt to answer the following questions:  (a) If multi-unit franchising (MUF) is considered as a phenomenon that challenges the basic rationale for franchising, what would be the economic rationale that justifies the existence of multi-brand franchisees (MBFs)?  (b)  If the conventional setup in franchising is a powerful, central franchisor surrounded by a large chain of highly-dependent single/multi-unit franchisees, why would a large franchisor (principal) such as KFC, Starbucks, IHop, Zara, H&M, or Burger King agree to grant exclusive franchise rights to a franchisee (agent), who will not grant him back any exclusivity and may even sell close substitutes or competing brands?  (c) Given the argument made by Lafontaine and Kalnins (2004) that “The problem in these cases is that a franchisee’s ownership of multiple units within a market reduces his incentives to behave as aggressively as a set of single-unit franchisees would”, why would a franchisor  strategically and rationally decide to be just one-among-many franchisors in a smaller company’s portfolio and accept to compete with other franchisors for a limited pool of organizational resources rather than being the only business for a small, ambitious entrepreneur who lives on that business?  The remainder of this article is organized as follows: first, we establish the MBF phenomenon by giving examples and illustrations. Second, we survey the different theoretical lenses used by researchers in various disciplines to study franchising. Third, we reflect on the application of agency theory in channels and franchising research and highlight its major predictions. Fourth, we use a novel,  Empirical assessment in progress. P a g e  | 7 integrated agency theory perspective to offer a conceptual framework and theoretical hypotheses for explaining the MBF phenomenon. Fifth, we highlight the contributions of this article to theory and practice. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.   MULTI-BRAND FRANCHISEES (MBFs): THE PHENOMENON A franchisee is called a multi-brand franchisee if he operates outlets within more than one franchise chain, in contrast to a multi-unit franchisee who operates more than one outlet within the same franchise chain. An MBF’s portfolio of franchises may contain non-competing franchises (e.g. KFC and GAP), close substitute franchises (McDonald’s and Subway), or even rival franchises (McDonald’s and Burger King). Even though MBFs are present in developed markets, they are more likely to be visible in emerging markets. Emerging market MBFs are often large business groups that have multi-industry exposure, several divisions, and a highly diversified business model. Table 1 presents some MBF examples in the US, Middle East, India, and Philippines.The crux of the economic logic for franchising is to enable the franchisor to achieve the outcomes of vertical integration without the need to vertically-integrate the chain (Stern et al., 1996). This makes franchising, as is the case with most decentralized distribution arrangements, replete with agency relationships among extant exchange partnersup and down (vertical agency between the franchisor and franchisees via shirking) as well as right and left (horizontal agency among franchisees through free riding). Hence, it is no surprise that agency theory is “by far the most common explanation of franchising” (Perryman & Combs, 2012).                                                                     Storholm and Scheuing (1994) list various aspects of moral hazard and opportunism in franchising relations. From the franchisor side, a franchisor may: (1) terminate the franchise agreement of a productive franchisee to open a franchisor-owned outlet at the same location, (2) force the franchisee to buy inputs from one of his partners or subsidiaries, (3) write the franchise contract in a way that renders the franchisee vulnerable in legal disputes, (4) misappropriate advertising royalties and place franchiseP a g e  | 8 Table 1 outlets at a proximity to each other. On the other side, a franchisee can harm a franchisor by: (1) exposing the franchisor’s proprietary information, (2) not abiding by quality standards, and (3) not paying royalties on time.  MBFs can create acute tensions in almost every aspect in the aforementioned list. For instance, the first point of friction with agency theory is the voluntary dilution of dependence by the franchisor. The central thesis in franchising theory is the elimination of double-sided moral hazard (shirking) by aligning the franchisee’s incentive with that of the franchisor via the residual claim mechanism P a g e  | 9 (Norton, 1988; Rubin 1987) under which the franchisee as a rational, utility maximizing agent is self-motivated to allocate his “maximum effort” to the franchise unit(s) he operates. On the other side, the franchisor invests in the brand to keep the royalty revenue healthy and flowing (Lal, 1990; Lafontine 1992). In the case of MBFs, the double-sided moral hazard rationale for franchising potentially fails because an MBF has a limited set of managerial, entrepreneurial, and financial resources that should be optimally allocated across a portfolio of franchise brands in order to maximize the joint profit of the business enterprise. Hence, the same rational, utility maximizing agent -- who in the case of single-unit franchising allocates his “maximum effort” to the outlet he is living on -- ends up allocating an optimal effort” to each one of the franchises in his portfolio. What can make this less palatable for a franchisor is the logical argument that new arrivals (recent franchises) in an MBF’s portfolio often cannot outstrip the incumbent successful franchises (which are already fueling the growth of the MBF and are naturally financially and emotionally dearer to the MBF) in their competition for the MBF’s limited organizational resources.  A second point of tension between the agency theory rationale for franchising and the MBF phenomenon could be the MBF’s reluctance to buy inputs from the franchisor’s designated suppliers. The MBF’s argument here could be that economies of scale and his existing supplier relationships in the local market can offer him more competitive prices. A third source of friction between the agency theory rationale (as applied in the franchising context) and the MBF phenomenon is the legal resources at the disposal of the MBF that enable him to better deal with legalities and disputes with the franchisor. A fourth source of friction between the agency theory rationale for franchising and the MBF phenomenon is the knowledge transfer that is likely to occur among the different franchises in the MBF's portfolio. One of the main drivers of the success of a franchise is its proprietary processes and knowledge i.e., the so-called “secrets of the trade”. Most of those processes and information are intangible and almost impossible to effectively protect contractually. The MBF at the end of the day is interested in the “joint profit” maximization of his portfolio of franchises which gives him a strong, P a g e  | 10 rational incentive for knowledge transfer between franchises, and he will likely do so. The fifth point of friction between the agency theory rationale for franchising and the MBF phenomenon is the re-emergence of vertical agency risks. The most basic proposition in franchising is that an owner-manager will not shirk while the employee-manager will shirk. In an MBF setting, this completely fails because the franchisee (an MBF) tends to be relatively isolated from the outlet(s) via layers of bureaucracy such as division heads, brand managers, and outlet managers.  In addition to the aforementioned tensions between the MBF phenomenon and the agency theory rationale for franchising, tensions also exist between the MBF phenomenon and other theoretical rationales for franchising.  For example, consider the power-dependence argument for franchising (Frazier & Summers, 1986; Tikoo, 2002; Michael, 2000). Here, a franchisor achieves the equivalent of a hierarchical governance structure via an unbalanced power equation and unidirectional rigorous contracting (Antia & Frazier, 2001). The reasoning here is straight forward: franchising is a game of control in which the franchisor can exercise the same level of control over its franchisees as that in a vertically integrated channel. This control arises from the degree of dependence that a franchisee has on that franchisor. In an MBF setting, the franchisee (MBF) is typically less dependent on the franchisor. Indeed, there may be situations where there is interdependence asymmetry, but the direction is reversed -- the franchisor is relatively more dependent on the franchisee (MBF). In light of the arguments presented above, it would be a fair argument to contend that the phenomenon of multi-brand franchisees (MBF) is one that seems to defy most of our extant franchising theory. In this article, we attempt to explore an appropriate theoretical framework that could explain the MBF phenomenon and reconcile it with existing franchising theory. Our starting point is a survey of the theoretical lenses that have shaped our scholarly understanding of franchising. P a g e  | 11 THEORETIC LENSES IN FRANCHISING THEORY Franchising is a heavily researched topic that spans multiple disciplines. The interdisciplinary nature of franchising research has led to great diversity in the theoretic lenses used to examine the phenomenon since each discipline brings with it a different theoretic toolkit. Some of the earliest inquiries into franchising as a form of distribution were in marketing with Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1969) advancing the resource scarcity thesis as the first theoretic logic for franchising. Other scholars (Katz & Joel, 1992; Thompson, 1994; Shane, 1996; Gillis & Combs, 2009) deepened and broadened this logic to establish resource scarcity as one of the leading theoretic paradigms for examining franchising. The main argument here is that franchising is a mechanism for accessing financial and managerial resources to achieve quick expansion. Economics scholars attempted to understand franchising as an efficientform of governance. Two notable surveys of the literature (Lafontaine & Slade, 1997; Dnes, 1996) identified agency theory as the main theoretic lens for franchising. Resource scarcity and agency theories, along with the associated theories such as signaling theory (Dant & Kaufmann, 2003) and the resource-based view (Mariz‐Pérez & García‐Álvarez, 2009; Gillis et al., 2014), seem to be the  dominant theoretic views in franchising research. That being said, other theoretic frameworks were employed by researchers in marketing, entrepreneurship, and strategy such as the transaction cost theory (Michael, 2000), property rights theory (Windsperger & Dant, 2006), and institutional theory (Shane & Foo, 1999).  After a careful contemplation of all existing theoretic lenses in the franchising literature, we found that the best theory to explain the MBF phenomenon is perhaps the theory that appears to clash with the most: agency theory. To reconcile the MBF phenomenon with agency theory, we first review the existing predictions of agency theory in the franchising literature, which are primarily drawn from the motivation component (moral hazard) in the theory. Then we employ agency theory in a novel way that enables it to explain the MBF phenomenon without the support of any other theory or a change to any of its assumptions or boundaries. To do so, we adopt a more integrative approach to agency theory. P a g e  | 12 An approach that simultaneously activates both components of the agency theory: the motivation (moral hazard) component and the ability (adverse selection) component to create a more comprehensive theoretic perspective. In the next section, we review the applications of agency theory in the distribution channels and franchising research. AGENCY THEORY IN CHANNELS RESEARCH Agency theory uses the contract metaphor to represent a relationship in which one party (principal) delegates a task to another (agent) in an asymmetric information setting and under uncertainty (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). Whenever a principal decides to enter into a contractual relationship with an agent, the principal will face two types of problems: (a) pre-contractual problems (aka hidden information problems) related to whether the agent has the characteristics the principal is looking for and how the principal can verify that before entering into the contractual relationship ; (b) post-contractual problems (aka as hidden actions problems) related to how the principal can assess and reward the performance of the agent to motivate him to act in a way that maximizes the principal’s outcome (Bergen et al., 1992).  Economists often refer to the hidden information and hidden action problems as the adverse selection and moral hazard problems respectively. In this article, we draw on the terminology used by Banerjee and colleagues and refer to the adverse selection problem as the ability problem and to moral hazard problem as the motivation problem (Banerjee et al., 2012).  The focal agency assumptions which apply to both problems are: (1) both parties are rational utility maximizers driven by self-interest, (2) task delegation takes place under asymmetric information where the agent is more informed, (3) realized outcomes depend on exogenous environmental uncertainty, and (4) the agent is risk averse whereas the principal is risk neutral (Bergen et al., 1992). With few exceptions, agency theory has often been employed to tackle one agency problem at a time, either the pre-contractual P a g e  | 13 abilityproblem or the post-contractual motivationproblem. This resulted in two dominant modes of operation for agency theory in the channels literature: the motivation mode and the ability mode. The Motivation Mode: The most common mode of agency theory in channels research is the moral hazard or the motivation mode. The main problem here is that the principal and the agent have conflicting goals: it is optimal for the risk averse agent to shirk and exert the minimal effort that keeps him in the job, whereas the principal’s goal is to maximize his outcome, which is a function of the agent’s effort. To mitigate this motivation problem, principals can choose between two courses of action: (a) Behavior-based compensation systems: under such systems, the principal invests in monitoring systems and mechanisms, monitors the agent’s behavior, and relies on contracts that define the agent’s compensation as a function of his observedeffort i.e., compensation= f (observed effort)or (b) avoid monitoring costs (and other agency costs) and design a contract that motivates the agent to exert his maximum effort by defining his compensation as a function of realized outcomes rather than observed effort while offering incentives that align both parties goals i.e., “compensation = f (realized outcome).” So, on the part of the principal, the core of the motivation problem is to design a contract that provides an efficient monitoringcost – incentive tradeoff (Eisenhardt, 1989; Ross, 1973; Bergen et al., 1992). The Ability Mode: Substantially less common in the channels literature is the application of the adverse selection mode of the agency theory. The main problem here is that is the principal knows the traits that the agent must possess to be able to effectively perform the tasks that the principal will delegate to him. However, the principal doesn’t know precisely whether the agent he is hiring actually possesses those required traits since those traits are the agent’s hidden informationEconomic theory suggests three primary mechanisms to mitigate the ability problem: one by the agent and two by the principal. An able agent (a productive employee who meets the job P a g e  | 14 requirements) invests in some activities that signal his traits to the principal and distinguish him from the unable agent (a less productive employee who does not meet the job requirements). Thus, the principal observes the agent’s signal and becomes more informed which mitigates the information asymmetry issue and consequently the ability problem. Examples include the investment in educational degrees by job market candidates (see Spence’s 1973 seminal article) or the investment in acquiring safe driving certificates in the auto insurance market. The economics literature offers two mechanisms for the principal to tackle the ability problem. First, screening, where the principal invests in some ability assessment mechanisms such as job interviews, job exams, reference letters, or other information gathering activities. Agency costs manifest themselves here in the form of screening and assessment costs that creates inefficiencies. Second, self-selection, where the principal designs contracts that entice unable agents to select themselves out. Examples here are insurance policies with high deductibles or job offers that require rigorous training and performance assessment during probation periods. The Integrated Mode: The vast majority of the channels literature, as well as the marketing and perhaps management literature, activates a single mode of agency theory: the motivation or the ability mode. A notable exception in the economics literature is Picard’s (1987) work in which he examined incentive schemes designing in a world with both adverse selection and moral hazard. We refer to this mode as the integratedmodeof agency theory. In his work, Picard suggests a “menu of quadratic incentive schemes” as a mechanism for reducing both moral hazard and adverse selection simultaneously. Hence, Picard models adverse selection and moral hazard as two parallel frictional forces pulling in the same direction away from the desired efficiency point, and the objective is to enhance efficiency by reducing the impact of both forces simultaneously. Other exceptions include Grünhagen, Zheng, & Wang (2017) in the franchising literature, Perryman and Combs (2012) in the channels literature, and Raassens et al. (2012) in the new product development literature. P a g e  | 15 The Integrated Antiparallel Mode: In this article, we apply agency theory in a way that not only uses the integrated agency theory mode (as in Picard’s case), but also models moral hazard and adverse selection as two antiparallel frictional forces that are pulling performance away from the target efficiency point in opposite directions. The challenging situation here is that unlike Picard’s case (in which the principal could take a single action that mitigates both adverse selection and moral hazard), the situation involves a tradeoff such that when you reduce the threat of one agency problem, you increase the threat of the other. The objective then becomes to reduce the overall inefficiency by identifying the optimaltradeoff between the two frictional forces. We call this mode the Integrated Antiparallel Mode of agency theory. So, whereas the integrated parallel mode presents adverse selection and moral hazard as two frictional forces pulling away from the desired efficiency point in the same direction, the integrated antiparallel mode presents them as two frictional forces pulling away from the target efficiency each in a different directionFigure 1 presents a simple graphical and mathematical intuition for the four aforementioned modes of operation of agency theory:P a g e  | 16 In the next section, we present a brief summary of the applications of agency theory in franchising research. Then, we advance our conceptual framework and propose the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis as an agency theoretic explanation for the MBF phenomenon and a more integrative application of agency theory in franchising research, especially in markets with high institutional uncertainty.AGENCY THEORY APPLICATIONS IN FRANCHISING Along with resource scarcity theory, agency theory has shaped most of our theorizing in franchising. Table 2 presents a representative summary of the main agency arguments in franchising. P a g e  | 17 Table 2 Theoretic Argument Representative  Literature Agency Mode Franchising is an effective governance structure that minimizes vertical agency costs (costs of monitoring and incentivizing managers) through the residual claim mechanism that substitutes incentives for monitoring costs and aligns the interests of both the principal (franchisor) and the agent (franchisee) and eradicates shirking.  (The Vertical Single-sided Agency Thesis). Rubin, 1978;  Bradach, 1997 Moral Hazard Franchising enhances exchange efficiency by reducing opportunism on both sides of the dyad via an effective revenue mix (franchise fee, royalty rate) that aligns both parties’ incentives and balances risk with reward.  (The Vertical Double-sided Agency Thesis) Lafontaine, 1992;  Klein, 1995;  Lafontaine & Bhattacharyya, 1995 Moral Hazard Plural governance, which is the maintenance of a mix of owned outlets and franchised outlets within the franchise chain, is a governance device that mitigates horizontal agency costs (free-riding among franchisees that leads to under-investment in the brand and quality decline). Franchisors own focal outlets at vital locations to maintain brand quality and franchise less vital outlets. Also, franchisors own close outlets and franchise distant ones because the costs of monitoring nearby outlets are affordable.  (The Horizontal Single-sided Agency Thesis) Brickley & Dark, 1987; Norton, 1988; Caves & Murphy, 1976 Moral Hazard In a franchising relationship, both parties (franchisor, franchisee) are subject to dual agency i.e., (a) adverse selection where both parties may misrepresent themselves before entering into the contractual relationship, and (b)moral hazard where both parties may act opportunistically after entering into the contractual relationship. (The Vertical Dual Agency Thesis) Grünhagen, Zheng,    & Wang, 2017 Moral Hazard  & Adverse  Selection CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND THEORETICAL HYPOTHESISAs evident in the table above, as well as in the broader franchising literature, moral hazard, or the motivationproblem, is the main mode of operation of agency theory in franchising research. In our examination of multi-brand franchisees, we rely on the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory in which moral hazard and adverse selection are present and pulling the firm’s performance away from its desired efficiency point but each in a different direction i.e., acting as antiparallel frictional forces. P a g e  | 18 The role of uncertainty in the agency theory is a focal one and, as underscored earlier, environmental uncertainty is a major assumption in the theory.  Swift, successful chain expansion is at the heart of the franchising logic, and franchisors are always under increasing competitive pressures to expand because chain size offers economies of scale, bargaining power in both directions of the supply chain, wider portfolio of entrepreneurial, financial and intellectual capabilities, higher brand awareness, spatial preemption of competition, and greater advertising leverage (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1969; Katz & Joel, 1992; Thompson, 1994; Shane, 1996; Gillis & Combs, 2009). This is arguably the crux of the resource scarcity thesis. International expansion of a franchise system takes the aforesaid capabilities and efficiencies to a new level by bringing in a distinctive, dynamic, and diverse array of resources (Fladmoe-Lindquist, 1996; El Akremi et al., 2015), especially when the local market is moving towards saturation. Notwithstanding that, the mortality rates of franchise systems can be high, and the survival of a franchise system is highly dependent on the age and size of the chain among other factors (Stern et al., 1996; Shane & Foo, 1999). This makes entry to a new market, especially an emerging one, a very risky, yet a strategic, decision that requires deep deliberation and far-sighted risk-benefit assessment.  The gap between the number of MBFs in emerging markets in comparison to developed markets suggests the presence of some unique forces in emerging markets that drift the franchise manager away from the conventional “stylized facts” in franchising, which assume no presence of MBFs, or at most a very rationed presence, within the chain. Burgess and Steenkamp (2006) argue that emerging markets “present significant departures from the assumptions of theories developed in the Western world that challenge our conventional wisdom.” In their article, Burgess and Steenkamp conduct an extensive comparison between the two business environments over three institutional dimensions: socioeconomic, regulative, and cultural. In brief, they highlight that the socioeconomic environment in emerging markets is considerably more dynamic and more demographically diverse (income, education, household size, human development level) than in advanced markets. The cultural P a g e  | 19 environment is characterized by a high degree of social embeddedness and hierarchical authority structures. The regulative environment is characterized by higher stakeholders’ influence on governance, greater abuse of public/corporate office power, less efficacy of the rule-of-law, lower investor rights, and higher regulatory instability (for a detailed discussion see Burgess and Steenkamp, 2006). These factors make the level of institutional uncertainty in emerging markets much higher than that in developed markets. These considerations suggest the following. First, franchising researchers relied extensively on the motivationmode of the agency theory because most of our franchise research was conducted in the developed world, mainly the U.S., where (a) the availability and reliability of objective, standardized ability assessment techniques such as credit ratings, certifications, educational degrees, and recommendations, (b) the effectiveness of misrepresentation and unethical behavior laws, and (c) the relatively little abuse of public/corporate office power discount the anxiety about the ability problem and directs the franchise manager’s attention to the motivation problemSecond, franchising researchers have overlooked the moderating role of institutional uncertainty due to the familiarity of franchise managers, in developed markets, with the socioeconomic, cultural, and regulative systems, and the availability of meaningful data that allows practical levels of predictability and little institutional uncertainty. This logic does not hold in emerging markets.  Third, the overwhelming institutional uncertainty in emerging markets makes ability the main concern for the franchise manager because its effect on performance is much higher than that of motivation. Under highly uncertain environments, a decision maker is typically more concerned about macro uncertainty (socioeconomic, cultural, regulative) than micro uncertainty (shirking). Hence, he becomes rationally more willing to trade motivation off for ability. Ability in emerging markets takes the form of organizational resources, legitimacy, size, relational capabilities, marketing capabilities, and the likes. So, institutional uncertainty moderates the ability-performance link positively and the motivation-performance link negatively because environmental uncertainty reduces the effectiveness of motivation (keeping in mind that the agent is risk averse).  P a g e  | 20 Fourth, emerging markets necessitate the use of the integrated mode of agency theory, in which both ability and motivation are present and where uncertainty plays a central moderating role; specifically, the antiparallel version. Why the antiparallel, not the parallel mode? In franchising the concept of motivation is simply a dependence game in which the franchisor (principal) motivates the franchisee (agent) to exert his maximum effort through the residual claim mechanism. Since the franchisee is often highly dependent on his franchise outlet (often living on it), this will be very effective. In emerging markets, and mainly for MBFs, ability and motivation tend to move in opposite directions where the more able the candidate the harder it is to motivate him. The intuition here is very simple and straightforward: think of the reservationutility in the classic microeconomic principal-agent model in which to entice an agent to exert a desired level of effort, the principal must make sure that his contract satisfies both the individual rationality and the incentive conditions. Within the same model, we assume that the higher the ability of the agent, the higher his reservation utility, and thus a higher incentive is required. Another basic intuition here is the following example. Think of a franchise outlet that produces an annual net income of $250,000 and is owned by a mom-and-pop or by two young entrepreneurs, and imagine the level of commitment and motivation that the owners will have. On the other hand, the same $250,000 would be less significant on the income statement of a large, diversified MBF enterprise and would constitute a much lower motivation. So, the basic economics of incentives suggest that motivation is directly proportional to dependence, whereas dependence is inversely proportional to ability. This provides the intuition behind the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory used in this article in which both the ability problem and motivation problem pull the franchisor away from his target efficiency point but in opposite directions. Based on the above four arguments we present our ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis (H1)as a theoretic explanation for the multi-brand franchisees phenomenon. Our conceptual framework is depicted in figure 2. P a g e  | 21 : As institutional uncertainty (socioeconomic, cultural, and regulative) increase, franchisors are more willing to trade motivation off for ability. For suggestions on how to empirically test the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis, please consult the section “suggestions for future empiricalresearch”towards the end of the article.                   Figure 2 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEORY Franchising researchers have investigated numerous governance issues: from the classic general ones such as vertical and horizontal integration to the more recent and idiosyncratic ones such as multi-unit franchising, ownership redirection, and dual distribution or plural governance. Nonetheless, scholarship has largely overlooked multi-brand franchisees. A notable exception here is Grünhagen et al. (2020) who examined the multi-brand franchisees phenomenon from a franchisee’s perspective.  Empirical assessment in progress. P a g e  | 22 They advance an evolutionary laddered-diversification explanation for the MBF phenomenon (from the franchisee perspective) where franchisees evolve over time into multi-unit franchisees and eventually into MBF as they accumulate franchising experience -- the motive is mitigating the risk of their business portfolio. This leaves a gap in our understanding of franchising governance and calls for some research attention. In this modest effort, we attempt to fill this gap and contribute to the extant, rich franchising literature by providing some novel theoretic insights into this thought-provoking phenomenon, which is rampant in emerging markets but less visible, though present, in developed markets (see table 1). This research departs from existing work on the MBF phenomenon (Grünhagen et al., 2020) by: (a) taking the franchisor’s perspective to the phenomenon -- a perspective that involves greater focus on interorganizational tensions, and (b) examining the franchisor’s strategic, conscious decision to trade off one agency problem for another when entering into a relationship with an MBF (vs. the more evolutionary and gradual diversification perspective and approach of the franchisee).  For the lay observer, multi-brand franchisees (MBF) constitute an empirical anomaly that defies the primary logic in franchising - the agency framework. Thus, he sees MBFs as the result of some circumstantial, ad hoc managerial decisions that are at best naïve or maybe irrational. For the impatient observer, MBFs are an interesting phenomenon that needs to find a theoretic house, but agency theory does not appear to be that house due to the high level of friction between the phenomenon and the theory. However, for the discerning researcher, MBFs are one of the most intriguing manifestations of agency theory that does not violate any agency assumption but requires the full capacity of the theory to address its empirical complexity. In addition to our contribution to the franchising literature, we contribute to the information economics literature by operating agency theory in a novel mode that, to the best of our knowledge, has never been applied in the literature before: the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory. It is by no means an extension of, an extrapolation of, or addition to the theory. Every aspect in the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory is present in the classic agency theory and straightforwardly falls P a g e  | 23 within its theoretic boundaries. It is just a new angle for viewing a powerful, multifaceted theory that has influenced almost every discipline in social sciences. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Despite the fact that this study is predominantly a theoretical examination of an existing phenomenon, it provides a more integrative approach to understanding franchising that could inform practitioners and guide them in their decision-making process. Franchising is not merely a motivation game as most of the literature suggests. Rather, it is a complete agency game that involves both agency components, ability and motivation. Therefore, in situations with low institutional uncertainty, the franchise manager can focus more on the motivation component when designing a franchise contract because the ability component is less severe and manageable. In situations with moderate institutional uncertainty, a franchise manager should design a contract the tackles both problems at the same time as the two problems tend to be simultaneously manageable (the integrated parallel mode). On the other hand, in situations with high institutional uncertainty (e.g., emerging markets), a prudent franchise manager should be cognizant of the demanded ability-motivation tradeoff that is sometimes unavoidable when entering turbulent institutional environments and should make his decision accordingly. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH Science philosophers have noted that science advances through an induction–deduction cyclewithin which a researcher observes some interesting empirical phenomenon, theorizes about it (the induction stage), and advances a refutable proposition. Then, another researcher(s) contemplates this proposition, derives some testable hypotheses from it, collects some meaningful data, and subjects the hypotheses to empirical testing (the deduction stage). This empirical testing leads to an affirmation or disconfirmation of the proposition, which in both cases induces extensions to the thesis or alternative P a g e  | 24 explanations (back again to the induction stage) and so on and so forth. This article is an initial attempt to scratch the surface of a complex phenomenon that at the first sight defies the basic arguments in franchising theory. Rigorous empirical testing of the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis is needed to probe further into this phenomenon and advance our knowledge through the affirmation/disconfirmation induction. Here are few suggestions on how to empirically test the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesisa)  Collecting data from one giant U.S. franchise chain such as Burger King or Dunkin Donuts (to control for cross-chain variations) and testing whether the aggregate number of brands held by all chain members in the U.S. is lower than the aggregate number of brands held by all chain members in the U.K., which is lower than the aggregate number of brands held by all chain members in India or the United Arab Emirates. The intuition here is to use the U.K or some other EU country as a control since it lies between the U.S. and emerging markets in terms of institutional uncertainty.  Conducting qualitative research using in-depth interviews with franchise managers asking about situations under which they opt for an MBF vs. a single brand franchisee. (c)  Conducting conjoint analysis, along the lines of Murry and Heide’s (1998) study, where researchers present to franchise managers a series of scenarios in which there are different (franchisee ability, franchisee motivation, institutional uncertainty) combinations, and examine their responses. By doing so, we can disentangle the tradeoff between the two concerns, ability and motivation, and the contingencies that govern this tradeoff.LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCHGerman Nobel laureate and the father of quantum physics, Max Planck, once said, “Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.” This article advances the P a g e  | 25 ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis as a theoretic explanation for the phenomenon of multi-brand franchisees. This does not rule out the existence of superior theoretic alternatives that could be more capable of explaining this phenomenon. A strong candidate is transaction cost analysis (TCA) coined by Coase (1937) and popularized by Williamson (1989, 1991). Agency theory and TCA, have much in common. Williamson himself stated that the two theories are “complementary” and help in understanding the economic organization. Under TCA, we can think of MBFs as an adaptation phenomenon in which the franchisor chooses the governance structure that provides him with the lowest adaptation costs in a highly uncertain environment where he has little asset specificity. Another strong theoretical candidate is the resource-based view of the firm coined by Wernerfelt (1984) and popularized by Barney (1991) and Makadok (2001). The main argument here is that the franchisor attempts to capitalize on the scope capability of the franchisee, which is very effective in highly turbulent markets that naturally call for such capability.CONCLUSION The case of multi-brand franchisees, who operate outlets within more than one franchise chain, is a thought-provoking one that at the first glance looks like an empirical anomaly or a rogue phenomenon that defies the predictions of the most established theories in franchising (mainly those coming from the agency theory or the power-dependence perspective). To advance our theoretical understanding of this complex phenomenon, we draw on the theory that it appears to clash with the most, agency theory, and operate this theory in a novel mode that utilizes the full capacity of the theory, a mode we call the integrated antiparallel mode of agency theory, in which both components of the agency dilemma, the motivation problem and the ability problem, are present and involve a tradeoff. Drawing on this integrated, dynamic mode of agency theory, we advance the ability-motivation tradeoff hypothesis as the theoretic explanation for multi-brand franchisees. This hypothesis P a g e  | 26 argues that in markets with high institutional (socioeconomic, cultural, and regulative) uncertainty, such as emerging markets, franchise managers are more concerned about ability than motivation due to the high risk inherent in such volatile, complex business environments. Hence, they become more willing to trade off motivation for ability, which leads to partnering with more locally capable firms. This leads to the emergence of multi-brand franchisees. As a final thought, consider the effect of institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991) that leads to an amplification of this phenomenon where new entrants often imitate the behavior of their incumbent peers and incline more towards partnering with MBFs. This makes the phenomenon more prevalent and adds more legitimacy to its practice.

This case study is designed to facilitate an understanding of participants’ experience of the business model from different perspectives. It raises the complex problems and issues that can occur throughout the lifecycle of a business format franchise and is based on a real case.  Introduction Franchising is a dominant business strategy for the distribution of goods and services both domestically and internationally. Franchise operations are increasingly found nested within public and proprietary corporate groups. Retail Food Group (RFG) is a franchisor of 11 franchise brands (at August 2019): Brumby's Bakery, Michel's Patisserie, Donut King, Crust Gourmet Pizza, Pizza Capers, Gloria Jean's, Cafe2U, The Coffee Guy, BB's Café, Big Dad's Pies and Esquires Coffee. It is a global franchise and coffee business supported by a manufacturing and distribution division. Specialising in food and beverage the company is headquartered in Australia and has been listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) since 2006. It was trading at $7.49 per share in 2015, at 10 cents per share in January 2020 and $0.075 cents per share in March 2021. RFG requested a trading halt in November 2019, seeking funding through a $150m institutional placement. Problems for RFG range from  needing to keep diverse stakeholders (public company shareholders analysists and regulators) happy,  meeting statutory obligations to shareholders, supporting a rapidly growing network, addressing competition among competing brands and managing a high turnover of head office staff.  Changes in the corporate structure of the franchisor led to franchisees having a ‘new’ franchisor that implements different systems and provided different support than their original franchisor did.   On 14 March 2019, Australia’s Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on Corporations and Financial Services published its report ‘Fairness in Franchising’ into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct (Code). The PJC commented that \"the problems, including exploitation in certain franchise systems, are systemic\". It said that franchisors have been empowered to take advantage of franchisees under the current regulatory framework, with franchise agreements and the Code offering insufficient protection to franchisees. One sixth of the franchisee submissions made to the inquiry related to RFG. The PJC was particularly critical of RFG calling for three regulators to investigate its directors. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) regulates anti-competitive conduct, consumer protection issues under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and enforces the Franchising Code of Conduct. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulates compliance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) administers commonwealth taxation laws. The PJC was broadly critical of franchisors owned by private equity.  This case study is an opportunity to examines issues presented from three perspectives; a Gloria Jean’s franchisee, RFG as the franchisor and publicly listed company, and a junior accountant working at Retail Food Group’s head office. Both the perspective of the franchisee and junior accountant are general experience cases, created from franchisees ‘submissions to the 2018 PJC. Submissions to a PJC are made on oath and are protected by parliamentary privilege. The RFG perspective is a published information case, based on information sourced from the company’s annual reports, news articles, media release, submissions to the PJC, and the PJC’s final report.  Part I encompasses the franchisee’s perspective. The main objective is to understand the pre-contractual decision-making processes and due diligence activities undertaken by prospective franchisees. The franchisee’s perspective is also illustrative of the complex problems and issues that arise throughout the lifecycle of a business format franchise. Part II focuses on Retail Food Group in its role as franchisor. This section facilitates insights into decision-making from the perspective of both a franchisor and a publicly listed company. Finally, the experience of a junior accountant employed by the franchisor is provided. The issues facing this stakeholder centre on employment obligations, whistle-blowing activities, and organisation culture. Regulatory background The current multi-layered approach to regulation of the business model in Australia is delivered through the Competition and Consumer Act (2010) (CCA), a federal level industry-specific subordinate legislation called the Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 2014 (the Code),  and general commercial and contract  case law.The Franchise Council of Australia (FCA) is the industry body and a voluntary organisation, with membership open to any organisation or individual stakeholder. Relevant legislation  Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 20141. Gloria Jean’s franchisee  The case study is based on real events documented in submissions made by franchisees to the Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Inquiry into Franchising in 2018. A profile of a hypothetical Gloria Jean’s coffee shop franchisee has been created from the sum of these experiences. Real names of the franchisees and their store location have been changed for privacy purposes.  All details are sourced from the public record. 1.1 Specific issues The franchisees reflects on whether more due diligence at the beginning of their journey could have put them in a better decision to predict and prepare for the difficulties that could follow.   Are the current pre-contractual protections sufficient to protect franchisees from franchisors behaving opportunistically? In 2011, husband and wife, Maria Ferraro (aged 44) and Luigi Ferraro (aged 46), purchased their first business, a Gloria Jean’s franchised coffee shop. The couple had long discussed owning their own business but were worried that they did not have the business knowledge and skills required to build a successful business from scratch. Both had completed secondary education and neither had studied at a tertiary level. They each had more than 20 years’ experience working in and managing food and retail businesses. The idea of purchasing a proven business model, that came with ongoing support seemed perfect. The Ferraro’s attended a franchise trade fair and decided that they would like to become Gloria Jean’s franchisees.   Maria and Luigi entered into discussions with the Australian licensors for Gloria Jean’s, a proprietary company called Jireh International Pty Ltd (Jireh) trading as Gloria Jean’s Coffee. During the pre-contractual phase, the Ferraro’s were advised to speak with existing Gloria Jean’s franchisees about their stores and experiences. The names and contact details of the specific stores they were to speak with were provided by the sales consultant from Jireh. They also sought advice on the proposed investment from a solicitor and accountant. Having believed that they had undertaken the necessary due diligence, with no major objections or flaws pointed out by existing franchisees, or their solicitor or accountant, the Ferraro’s signed the franchise agreement in August 2011.  Their first outlet in a shopping centre opened in December 2011 and cost $450,000. This paid for the fit out, franchise fees, trademark fees and their opening stock. The franchisor negotiated a 7-year lease agreement that coincided with the 7-year franchise agreement. A further $20,000 was charged by the franchisor for Maria and Luigi to participate in a 2-week training program and $15,000 per year to the franchisor’s central advertising fund. Royalty fees were charged at 7% of gross annual turnover.  Reality began to set in for the Ferraro’s after 3 months of operating the store. According to Mr Ferraro “we discovered after only a few months of working in the store, that the profit and loss statements we were provided with were not a true reflection of the costs of running the business” adding further “it was at this point that we realised the Gloria Jean’s model we had to work with was well and truly broken.”  The problems with the business model were pervasive.  Within the first few months, the Ferraro’s began receiving additional bills from the shopping centre for opening their shop on weekends and public holidays, for centre security and cleaning costs. In the pre-contractual phase, the Gloria Jean’s head office had insisted on negotiating the lease directly with the shopping centre. The lease is in the name of the franchisor as head tenant.  This left the Ferraro’s without any power to renegotiate the terms of the lease, the costs they were paying each month and the additional expenses. When the Ferraro’s tried to approach the Gloria Jean’s head office lawyers about their concerns, they found them to be “non-reactive, inefficient and inexperienced”. Mr Ferraro recalls “many franchisees that I know of lost their stores as the head office lawyers did not negotiate lease requirements within the required timeframes, or came in after initial talks were held, and ending up have a lease that disadvantaged the franchisee.” The Ferraro’s were only allowed to purchase stock items from an approved list of suppliers provided by the Gloria Jean’s head office. The suppliers had ‘special’ prices for Gloria Jean’s franchisees, that were often higher than if an enquiry for the same product was made direct to the supplier by a franchisee posing as an “independent trader”.   Incentives from suppliers were not passed on to the franchisee. Instead, they were paid direct to the franchisor’s head office, as an additional source of revenue. The Ferraro’s found that they could buy Gloria Jean’s coffee beans cheaper at the supermarket than they could buy them through the head office. But they were not allowed to do this as it was a breach of their franchise agreement. Marketing fund fees were charged at 2% of net sales. However, Luigi and Maria struggled to see a return on their compulsory payments to this fund. Two years into operating their store, the advertising posters that had been displayed on their walls since their first day of trading remained, now faded and outdated. After approaching the head office, the couple were told that they could have new signage and artwork printed at their own expense. The selection would need to be made from a very limited number of options made available to them by the franchisor. Several times Maria and Luigi asked for the marketing fund profit and loss statement. These statements did not clearly state where any money had been spent on actual marketing campaigns. The main expenses coming out of the fund were wages, paid to a daughter of the franchisor’s director.  In 2012, a series of negative media revelations aimed at the Australian licensee, Jireh negatively affected Maria and Luigi’s customer base. It was exposed that the franchisor was a significant donor to the Australian Christian Lobby, and had affiliations with the Hillsong Church and Mercy Ministries.  An ongoing legal dispute between Jireh and its US coffee bean supplier Western Export Services (WES) in 2010 and 2011 over royalty payments put the franchisor’s financial position into serious question and further damaged the brand. With the brand’s reputation being an essential part of the customer appeal, this negative publicity was worrying for Maria and Luigi. They were also surprised to learn of the court cases with WES, as the legal proceedings had not been disclosed to them through the disclosure document.  In 2013, about two years into their franchise term, the head office advised that the brand was being sold to a Singaporean company, Global Yellow Pages (GYP). Not long after this announcement, GYP moved into the head office and commenced running operations. Over the next 18 months, Jireh’s head office staff were made redundant, and the infrastructure that had previously supported the brand was destroyed. There was little head office support now available to franchisees, no marketing campaigns were organised, and no innovation occurred. This upheaval resulted in a loss of momentum for Gloria Jean’s. Eventually, the sale to GYP fell through, leaving only a few staff to run the head office operations for the whole of Australia.  Maria and Luigi recall the moment that they found out that a subsequent buyer, Retail Food Group (RFG), had purchased the Gloria Jeans brand. They were excited, because they believed the RFG had many other successful brands operating in their portfolio. They were optimistic about the changes to come.  A couple of months into ownership by RFG, Maria and Luigi began to see the price rises in their cost of goods sold (COGS). During this period, the Ferraro’s also encountered a revolving door of new head office management staff. Each new manager who came in tried to reinvent the wheel and put in place a new plan, bigger and better than the one before. Maria and Luigi acknowledge that in the first year or two, RFG spent an enormous amount of time and internal funds trying to reinvent the brand. A new look and concept would be presented, only to have this whole process repeated when the next General Manager resigned, and their replacement started. This process damaged the brand, and ultimately the value of Maria and Luigi’s cafe. Maria and Luigi found themselves in a position where their bank would not refinance their loan, as the brand was no longer meeting adequate financial requirements because there was no brand advancement or marketing. Maria and Luigi also heard of other franchisees who could not renew their lease, because shopping centres did not want passé brands in their complexes anymore.   Once a new direction for the brand was decided, the plans for the new fit outs and refurbishments were handled by head office. The Ferraro’s recalled that RFG commissioned quotes for the work at their store and then added an additional 20% cost on top of the quote before presenting it to them. Despite raising this as unconscionable activity with the RFG, the Ferraro’s were left with no option but to go ahead with the new fit out, at a significant personal cost. They felt they had nowhere to turn. Soon after paying for their new fit out, Maria and Luigi saw work commence for a Donut King, one of RFG’s other brands, less than 30 metres from their store. Once the Donut King opened, they experienced a weekly loss in sales of approximately $2,500 due to the similarity of their product offerings and their close proximity.  When this was raised with RFG, Maria and Luigi were advised that their franchise agreement and lease did not include any provisions on zone exclusivity. The issue of misappropriation of their marketing fund continued despite the change of ownership. Maria and Luigi became suspicious that their contributions were being used to fund a RFG-brand’s racing cars that the recently retired former CEO had been racing for many years.  Maria and Luigi’s relationship with RFG progressively deteriorated due to the failure of the franchisor to perform essential duties, adequately communicate, provide assistance, honour commitments, and address disagreements. RFG was increasingly adopting what the franchisees considered to be unethical and immoral fee-driven behaviour.  In 2017, nearing the end of their 7-year lease and franchise agreement, the couple had to decide whether they wanted to continue their association with RFG and sign a new set of agreements. As the re-negotiation phase commenced, Maria and Luigi were advised that if they wanted to renew their lease on the store, they would be charged a new franchise fee and would also need to pay to redo the franchisor’s training program at a cost of $20,000, despite having already done it. The couple decided to sell their business.  According to Maria and Luigi, the termination process was unfair and long-winded. The processes and delays caused by the franchisor led to the loss of potential purchasers. At one point, Maria and Luigi received an offer of $180,000 for their store, however the franchisor made the process so difficult, the potential buyer walked away, electing to forfeit the deposit that they had paid. Another potential buyer was directed away from Maria and Luigi’s store to a company owned store in a neighbouring suburb. Many of RFG’s company-owned stores were stores which franchisees had walked away from. During the process of selling their business, RFG offered one of its own stores to Maria and Luigi’s potential purchaser for $15,000.  This practice by RFG devalued their franchisee’s stores and made it impossible for them to sell while a company-owned store was available. Eventually, Maria and Luigi sold their store in 2018 for $60,000 plus stock.  Before allowing the sale of their business to the new franchisee, RFG forced Maria and Luigi to sign a confidentiality agreement. This agreement prevented the Ferraro’s from disclosing any details of their experiences, their relationship with RFG, the business or the products, to slander or seek retribution in any way, or to proceed with any legal action. The couple were restricted from owning another coffee shop after the sale of their franchise for a period of 4 years.   Over the course of owning the franchise, the Ferraro’s re-mortgaged their home and accumulated combined bank loans (home loan, business loans, bank guarantee, personal loan and credit card, franchise fees and arrears on rent, tax and superannuation debt) exceeding $700,000. On many occasions they were forced to inject funds into the business from their personal savings just to keep the business afloat. Neither Maria nor Luigi drew a wage for the first 3 years of operating the franchise, and then drew only a partial salary. The financial stress had a significant impact on their financial health, and on their mental health and marriage.   Reflecting on their experience and naivety in the pre-contractual period, Maria and Luigi acknowledged; “We were led to believe that all Gloria Jean’s stores made a minimum 28% profit. They don’t. Very few do this, if any; it is more like a 3% profit.”  The Ferraro’s often wonder whether they conducted enough due diligence before signing up to become franchisees. They did all they could. They later found out that the stores and franchisees that they had visited during the pre-contractual phase were only the very profitable stores, and not the average store. The franchisees operating the stores they had visited were also involved with the franchisor on a number of levels. They found out the financial statements they were provided with were estimates and not accurate portrayals of earnings.  They wished that they had sought advice during the pre-contract disclosure period from a solicitor and accountant with actual expertise in business format franchising.  In April 2018, the Ferraro’s made a submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry into Franchising. They asked that the PJC:  Consider holding franchisors accountable for the systemic failures in the business model and for providing no support in turning the business into a profitable state. The Ferraro’s asked that the Franchise Code of Conduct be revised to ensure that the franchisor has ‘skin in the game’ to make its directors more responsive and responsible for the success and profitability of their business model.  For a provision to be incorporated that requires franchisors to disclosure the full history of an existing outlet to prospective franchisees. This would reduce the risk of outlets that had failed on multiple occasions from being resold to unsuspecting franchisees.  For ‘example’ financials to be prohibited from inclusion in the disclosure documentation. This ought to be replaced by actuals. 1.2 Reading Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Limited[2010] NSWSC 622 Jireh International Pty Ltd v Western Export Services Inc[2011] NSWCA 137 Mercy Ministries in 20122. Retail Food Group  Retail Food Group (Australia) Limited (RFG) is a publicly listed global food and beverage company, headquartered in Queensland and with offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Los Angeles. Established in 1989, RFG was incorporated in 2003 to act as a holding company for several fast-growing franchise systems. It became Australia’s largest multi-brand retail food franchise owner, with vertically integrated businesses that includes a wholesale coffee roasting operation and a food distribution division. As an amalgamator of franchise brand RFG owns Gloria Jean's Coffees, Brumby's Bakeries, Donut King, Michel's Patisserie, Di Bella Coffee, The Coffee Guy, Café2U, Pizza Capers and Crust. RFG grew from being a small franchise system manager with fewer than 50 franchised outlets to a national and international operation with more than 2,400 outlets in total, of which 1,000 are in Australia. The remaining 1,400 franchised outlets are located in over 80 international licensed territories, that include the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia. RFG and its franchisees employ approximately 15,000 people. In 2014, Gloria Jean’s Coffees was purchased by RFG for $163.5 million from Jireh International Pty Ltd. At the time of purchase, Gloria Jean’s had 519 coffee outlets in Australia and 183 internationally. For RFG, the purchase of Gloria Jean’s Coffees made good business sense, the activities closely mirrored and complemented the existing RFG brands, such as Michel’s Patisserie, Donut King and Esquire’s Coffee Houses. The acquisition also meant:  Through Gloria Jean’s Coffees existing international franchise and licence agreements, RFG gained immediate access to established international markets and supply chain logistics, repositioning itself as a truly global business; A significant increase in the production of coffee, leading to the proliferation of trade for its wholesale coffee roasting business; Strengthening of its supply operations, leading to increased economies of scale, which in theory would benefit the entire RFG franchise community; Diversification of its income streams and a reduction in shareholders’ reliance on any one brand to generate profits; Realisation of RFG’s aspiration to become the largest integrated coffee centric business in the Asia-Pacific, that included wholesale distribution, coffee shops and an “in-home” supermarket product.   2.1 What has happened to the Gloria Jean’s franchisees since RFG took ownership? When RFG purchased Gloria Jean’s Coffees in 2014, existing franchisees were excited by the perceived opportunities that Australia’s largest retail food franchise could offer. Many were interested in becoming multi-unit franchisees and made efforts to further invest their futures in the company. However, it didn’t take long for the franchisees to realise that this would not be the case. Reflecting on the history of RFG, it is evident that the company has a culture of acquiring new brands. As one brand starts to fail, rather than investing to reinvent the floundering brand, it buys another one. For example, in 2006 franchise BB’s Cafe and Esquires Coffee Houses began to wane. In 2007, RFG acquired both Michel’s Patisserie and Brumby’s Bakery. The popularity of Michel’s Patisserie and Brumby’s Bakery began to wane in 2012; RFG acquired Gloria Jean’s Coffees the very next year.  From a franchisee’s perspective, a fundamental flaw in RFG’s operations lies in its growth strategy. Instead of investing in the growth of its individual brands by working with existing franchisees to ensure their success, RFG would instead grow by acquiring more brands. Given the size of its franchise network, RFG’s management believed that they could rely on their long list of well-known brands to ensure that there was always another prospective franchisee ready to buy a failed outlet. This practice, known as ‘churning’, became a financially rewarding short-term arrangement for RFG, but it is not a sustainable long-term strategy.  Between 1 January 2015 and 28 March 2018 franchisees of RFG brands contacted Australia’s competition, consumer protection and franchise regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, (ACCC) at least 61 times about issues relating to their relationship with their franchisor. However, the problems with the business model were made incontestably clear and were placed on the public record during the 2018 Australian Inquiry into the franchising. This inquiry was undertaken by Australia’s Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (the 2018 Committee). The 2018 Committee received 406 submissions. One sixth of the franchisee submissions related to RFG. Through the submissions made by Gloria Jean’s franchisees, serious allegations were made against RFG, in its role as franchisor. According to Gloria Jean’s franchisees, RFG engaged in unconscionable practices including, but not limited to, price gouging through significant fee increases across all aspects of the franchisee’s operations, misappropriation of the compulsory marketing fund levy and the receipt of undisclosed kickbacks from the franchisee’s purchase of goods through approved suppliers. This was in addition to RFG’s failure to provide adequate support or dispute resolution processes.  A further 29 public submissions were made by RFG franchisees in relation to the company’s other brands. In the 2018 Committee’s final report titled ‘The operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct’, it referred to RFG’s poor corporate culture, its \"high risk\" business model that relied on buying new brands, stripping out costs and exploitative gouging of franchisees. The Committee also recommended that the Australian Taxation Office, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and ACCC investigate RFG, former and current board members and senior executives for potential insider trading, tax evasion, quality of audit, director duties and continuous disclosure.  In 2019, there are fewer than 400 Gloria Jean’s franchises still open for business.  2.2 What were RFG’s responsibilities to Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  According to Australia’s Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code), there are certain documents a franchisor must provide prospective franchisee’s before entering into a franchise agreement. These include an information statement, disclosure document and a copy of the franchise agreement in its final form. Under the Code, the parties must also act in good faith towards one another.  Relevant to RFG’s acquisition of Gloria Jan’s Coffees, section 17 of the Code states that a franchisor must inform franchisees of materially relevant changes, such as change of ownership. However, a change in ownership does not afford current franchisees with the right to end their franchise agreement. A franchisee wanting to make a material change needs to obtain the consent of the franchisor, but the franchisor needs no such consent from franchisees. So, when Gloria Jean’s Coffees was purchased by RFG, existing Gloria Jean’s Coffee franchisees were left with no option but to accept the change of ownership, despite the significant implications that this major change would have on their businesses.  In any successful franchise model, there are implicit non-legal obligations that apply to the relationship between the two parties. The franchisor is responsible for nurturing the brand and should always be working to improve all aspects of their system for both franchisees and consumers. A good franchisor also provides initial and ongoing training and support while the franchisees deliver at the coalface. The relationship is symbiotic and always evolving. 2.3 What were RFG’s responsibilities to their public shareholders?  The Friedman Doctrine, or Shareholder Theory holds that a firm's only responsibility is to its shareholders. In Australia, shareholder primacy is paramount. The Corporations Act 2001provides that a director owes a fiduciary duty to the company. Specifically, Section 181(1) requires that directors act ‘in good faith in the best interests of the corporation’. In practice, this means in the interests of the shareholders or members of the company as a whole.  Two Australian Government reviews have been commissioned into whether Australia ought to extend the obligation for directors to act in the best interests of a wider range of stakeholders (for example, shareholders, customers, creditors, the local community), as is the case in France and Germany. The outcome of both reviews was that the law in Australia should remain unchanged and that these broader interests need only be considered in relation to the shareholders’ interests.  2.4 Striking a balance What then is the position of a Gloria Jean’s franchisee within the publicly listed RFG? In its final report, titled ‘Fairness in Franchising’ the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee acknowledged that ‘it is possible that RFG and its officers acted entirely within the bounds of the Franchising Code and other relevant laws. Given the potential exploitation of franchisees through churning and burning within the RFG system, this is a highly troubling proposition because it speaks to the extent to which an outfit such as RFG is able to engage in harmful but legal behaviour’. The report also acknowledged that RFG has damaged the reputation of franchising as a business model more broadly within Australia.  In the case of RFG, the interests of the franchisees were subordinated to the interests of the shareholders. Despite not breaking any of Australia’s corporations’ laws, RFG failed to foresee that corporate goodwill and profitability were inextricably tied to the performance of their franchisee network. While the increase in fees payable by their franchisees may have provide a short-term boost to RFG’s financial bottom line, a franchisor’s, and in this case, a publicly listed franchise owning company’s, long-term profits and sustainability depend for longevity on its franchisees financial success and the strength of the franchisor’s reputation.  The 2018 Committee also recommended that appropriate enforcement action ought to occur where investigations indicate evidence of churning and burning. It further recommended that the ACCC be given powers to intervene to prevent franchisors from marketing and selling franchises during an investigation. As evidenced through the negative publicity and public shaming of RFG, franchisee dissatisfaction became an unstoppable virus that quickly spread through the RFG network. The 2018 Committee acknowledged that the share market has, somewhat belatedly, delivered a damning assessment of RFG's business model. This negative assessment is mirrored by the stringent terms and conditions imposed on RFG by its lenders and the independent auditor's assessment that identifies significant doubt regarding RFG's capacity to continue as a going ‘Fairness in Franchising’14 March 2019,Commonwealth of Australia, p 49.concern.  was trading on the ASX at $7.49 in 2015 and at 14 cents per share in November 2019.  In a general sense, there are benefits to be derived for a franchisee whose brand is purchased by a publicly listed company that were not realised by Gloria Jean’s franchisees. For example, franchisors may be skilled in coming up with a business concept but may not necessarily be equipped, financially or managerially, to continually innovate and move their brand forward as it grows beyond a critical mass. A listed company has access to public funds for development and expansion, may be in a position to acquire competitors and can attract specialist management and directors who are experienced in managing and developing large brands. Of potential benefit to prospective franchisees, public companies are also subject to higher levels of financial disclosure, have reporting requirements and are audited.  2.5 Where to now?  Since the 2018 Franchising Inquiry, RFG is under new executive management. According to the new Executive Chairman, a range of initiatives to better support, connect and benefit RFG’s franchisees have been designed and implemented to improve services to customers. RFG’s Executive Chairman also acknowledged, “The current management team and Board completely understand that RFG’s future success is directly linked to the profitability of its franchisees. We have instituted a comprehensive program of investment and improvement to materially help existing and new franchisees grow and prosper.” It is concerning to note, however, the 2018 RFG Annual Report disclosed that during the 2018 financial year, 9 new international master licenses were granted. These included the Donut King and Crust Brand Systems in the United Kingdom and Gloria Jean’s in Germany.  3. Junior Accountant at RFG  The case study is based on real events documented in submissions made by Retail Food Group employees to the Australian Parliamentary Inquiry into Franchising in 2018. A hypothetical profile of a Retail Food Group employee has been created from the sum of these experiences. Real names of the employees have been changed for privacy purposes.  Sarah Green was a junior accountant, employed by Retail Food Group (RFG) in March 2016 to work at its Sydney head offices. Sarah’s role involved daily maintenance of franchisee files under the direction of a manager; including issuance of invoices to franchisees for payment of the various fees owed to RFG, performance of reconciliations and regular communication with the franchisee who’s accounts she managed.  Within a very short period of time working for RFG, Sarah began to realise that there were serious problems with the RFG business model. Sarah found herself spending most of her working day contacting franchisees regarding outstanding debts to RFG. While understanding that it was normal for people to feel varying degrees of anger, embarrassment and denial regarding outstanding debts, the stories were disconcerting in the regularity of the content. Every franchisee she spoke to seemed to have similar stories of frustration with RFG and increasing levels of stress. Sarah acknowledged in her submission to the 2018 Parliamentary Inquiry in Franchising that ‘There was an overwhelming sense of hopelessness among a lot of the Franchisees I dealt with’.  On a daily basis, Sarah was overcome by stories from exasperated franchisees who said they were lied to in the pre-contractual period about the alleged profit of the store they had purchased and that the profit and loss statements were altered just before their purchase was finalised. Sarah also realised that many of the franchisees had undertaken adequate due diligence during the pre-contractual period, secure in their belief that such a well-known company had credibility.  On one particularly disturbing occasion, a franchisee confessed that her husband was considering committing suicide just so they would receive a life insurance payment. This payment would settle their outstanding debts with RFG. Sarah immediately took this situation to her manager, who assured her that help would be provided to the family. However, when Sarah contacted the family a week later to see how they were going and to ensure someone had contacted them regarding support, the franchisee advised her that someone from RFG had been in contact, but only to tell them that there were outstanding payments and that were due urgently. Again, Sarah took the issue to her manager and she was assured that they would deal with it. Sarah took matters into her own hands and prepared a write-off proposal for the franchisee and presented it to her manager for sign off. It was. Sarah recalls, that in her 9-months working for RFG, she prepared this type of paperwork, without direction from her manager on many occasions.  A lack of support was evidenced throughout the RFG business model. Franchisees did not have access to ongoing business development or marketing support. Sarah acknowledged that everyone in these roles was sacked soon after she started and that the roles were re-established at a lower salary level, with significantly fewer employees. RFG had a huge staff turn-around and a low staff retention rate. It became clear that the senior management believed that there would always be someone to fill the roles. This attitude demonstrated a complete lack of insight regarding the value of staff retention. According to Sarah ‘There were clearly nowhere near enough support staff on the ground to properly and adequately support the franchisees despite this being one of the things franchisees were charged for by RFG.’  Sarah routinely attended presentations made by her manager where announcements were made about new and increased fees that would be charged to franchisees. She knew that there was a team of senior accountants constantly working on new ways to gouge more money from the franchisees. The franchisees were receiving an increasing number of bills for so called ‘improved products and support services’ allegedly being provided to them by RFG. Without any channels for disputing these bills, franchisees had no choice but to pay them or add the debts to their already overdrawn accounts. The common opinion among the franchisee’s Sarah dealt with was that they were slowly, but surely, being bled dry by RFG. Stores were closing regularly.  Sarah also became aware of many instances where RFG was breaching its contractual agreements with franchisees regarding the geographic proximity of their own stores opening in direct competition with each other. There were other instances where RFG permitted its own different brands operating in the same market to open without any concern for inter-brand competition. This was particularly the case with Pizza Capers and Crust Pizza stores. This practice led to many stores becoming unprofitable and ending in closure. When stores would close, RFG was quick to take over, running the outlet as a company-owned store for a period of time and then putting it up for sale to a new franchisee.  Sarah was the only regular point of contact that the franchisees had with RFG. She became the sounding board for their grievances. Sarah put numerous proposals forward to her manager in an effort to improve the issues she saw with the business model and on many occasions acted on behalf of other employees too scared to speak out. All of Sarah’s requests and suggestions were ignored. Sarah felt that the business model could not possibly be sustainable long term. Support staff and franchisees were disgruntled, stressed, and volatile; staff retention rate was low.  As a junior employee with only a few years of experience, Sarah didn’t know who to turn to. She was scared of reporting RFG to the Australian regulators, despite suspecting that the franchisor was acting unconscionably and unethically towards its franchisees. This would have made her a whistle-blower.  The hopelessness of the situation became too much for Sarah. She resigned after 9-months in the role. According to Sarah ‘The level of trauma I witnessed by the franchisees and staff of RFG was unlike anything I have previously been part of. I left because I could no longer function in that environment.’ TEACHING NOTE  SynopsisFranchising is a dominant business strategy for the distribution of goods and services both domestically and internationally. Franchise operations are increasingly found nested within public and proprietary corporate groups. Retail Food Group (RFG) owned 11 franchise brands (at August 2019): Brumby's Bakery, Michel's Patisserie, Donut King, Crust Gourmet Pizza, Pizza Capers, Gloria Jean's, Cafe2U, The Coffee Guy, BB's Café, Big Dad's Pies and Esquires Coffee. It is a global franchise and coffee business supported by a manufacturing and distribution division. Specialising in food and beverage the company is headquartered in Australia and has been listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) since 2006. It was trading at $7.49 per share in 2015, at 10 cents per share in January 2020 and the price of a share had dropped to $0.077 by 24 March 2021. It requested a trading halt in November 2019, seeking funding through a $150m institutional placement. The RFG story exemplifies problems that arise when a franchisor acquires established brands rapidly without having the necessary financial arrangements, management expertise, support infrastructure or organisational strategy in place. Challenges included  needing to keep additional stakeholders (public company shareholders and analysists) happy,  meeting numerous statutory obligations, supporting a rapidly growing network, addressing competition among brands, managing a high turnover of head office staff and management of a series of ownership changes that led to franchisees having a ‘new’ franchisor. The new franchisor implements different, and provides worse, systems and support for franchisees than the original franchisor did.   On 14 March 2019, the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on Corporations and Financial Services handed down its report ‘Fairness in Franchising’ into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct (Code). The PJC commented that \"the problems, including exploitation in certain franchise systems, are systemic\". It said that franchisors have been empowered to take advantage of franchisees under the current regulatory framework, with franchise agreements and the Code offering insufficient protection to franchisees. One sixth of the franchisee submissions made to the inquiry related to RFG. The PJC was particularly critical of RFG calling for three regulators, ACCC, ASIC and the ATO, to investigate its directors. It was also critical of franchisors owned by private equity.  This case study is comprised of three perspectives; a Gloria Jean’s franchisee, Retail Food Group as the franchisor and publicly listed company, and a junior accountant working at Retail Food Group’s head office. Both the perspective of the franchisee and junior accountant are general experience cases, comprised from submissions made by franchisees to the 2018 Parliamentary Inquiry. The RFG perspective is a published information case, comprised of information available through the company’s annual reports, news articles, media release, submissions to the parliamentary inquiry and final report.  2. Learning objectives  Drawing on Naumes work on effective learning objectives, we expect that after reading and analysing this teaching case, students will be able to:   Apply the regulatory framework relevant to business format franchising in Australia, from the perspective of franchisees and franchisors, and the complexities involved with a franchise model that is owned by a public company; Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the business format franchise model; Recognise that a business’s success is dependent on ethical, environmental and sustainable practices and considerations; Naumes, M. J. (2013). Writing effective learning objectives. Case Research Journal(1), 65-171.Analyse legal issues from a commercial perspective in a logical and structured way (ie to identify problems, research relevant sources, conduct due diligence and identify possible challenges to the reliability of franchise system due diligence). 3. Appropriate uses The case examines issues related to the nature and operation of franchising as a business model. In particular: evolution of the franchise business model, particularly in light of increased multi-unit franchisor ownership;  the legal implications of the franchisor/ franchisee contract-based relationship;  legal issues in the context of franchising (eg: intellectual property, retail leases, insolvency);  the regulation of franchising under the Franchising Code of Conduct prescribed under the Competition and Consumer Act (Cth) 2010; and the commercial realities of the franchise relationship.  The case study also highlights how poor attention to governance and human relationships within a complex business network, and how outdated legislation can lead to greater regulatory intervention and can attract prolonged regulator attention.  The case study will enhance student learning by drawing on a current, complex situation that provides lessons in business law and management. Further themes of corporate governance, business ethics, leadership, corporate strategy and sustainability ensure that the case is relevant to a wide range of both undergraduate and postgraduate courses within a business school.   4. Case analysis  The three cases can be taught together in one class or individually, depending on the level of detail the course is delving into, and the time available. Students should be allocated 15 minutes to read each individual case study in class, or should read the case beforehand.  INTRODUCTION [5 MINUTES] For the purposes of this teaching note, we will assume that each of the individual cases will be discussed in the one class.  Briefly discuss the franchise business model, the roles of franchisor, franchisee and head office staff. Ensure students are aware of the difference between a franchisor of single brand and a multi-brand franchisor, like Retail Food Group. Briefly discuss the increasing popularity of multi-brand franchise ownership.  PART 1 – FRANCHISEE’S PERSPECTIVE [30 MINUTES]  Break the class up into small groups of 6-8 students. Each group can be assigned two of the below questions to discuss amongst themselves for 10 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of small group reflection on the discussion questions and a 10-minute discussion. What due diligence should/can a franchisee do before they buy a franchised business? Considering the due diligence Maria and Luigi Ferraro undertook, what additional due diligence could they have undertaken in the pre-contractual stage? What additional information, beyond that which is already mandated through the franchise law in your jurisdiction, should prospective franchisees be provided with?  How does the franchise-specific law in your jurisdiction protect prospective franchisees? And, are these pre-contractual protections enough to protect franchisees from franchisor opportunism? What other avenues of redress exist for franchisees in the Ferraro’s position? How did the potential then actual change in ownership at a franchisor level affect Gloria Jean’s franchisee? Is the post-sale restraint of trade the Ferraro’s agreed to legally enforceable? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. PART 2 – FRANCHISOR’S PERSPECTIVE [30 MINUTES]  Break the class up into small groups of 6-8 students. Each group can be assigned two of the below questions to discuss amongst themselves for 10 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of small group reflection on the discussion questions and a 10-minute discussion. A section on recommendations has also been provided. If time permits, allow students to return to their groups for to discuss this. Conclude with a discussion of each group’s answers.  What are the obligations of RFG as new franchisor owner to Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  What are the differences between unethical and unconscionable behaviour?  Has RFG acted unethically towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. Has RFG acted unconscionably towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. Have RFG’s management team acted in accordance with their legal obligations? Explain your answer with supporting evidence. Propose strategies to balance the objectives of shareholders in a franchised company and the needs of franchisees. Recommendations: What are the most important changes that need to be made to RFG’s operations to ensure long-term success of both RFG and the franchisees of the 11 brands it controls? How can these changes be implemented to ensure long-term success? If you were thinking of global expansion where would your next move be to? PART 3 – JUNIOR ACCOUNTANT’S PERSPECTIVE [30 MINUTES]  Break the class up into small groups of 6-8 students. Each group can be assigned two of the below questions to discuss amongst themselves for 10 minutes. This is followed by 10 minutes of small group reflection on the discussion questions and a 10-minute discussion.  What are the responsibilities of the junior accountant to their employer, RFG?  What are the responsibilities of RFG to the junior accountant?  What are the ethical issues facing the junior accountant?  How does high staff turnover impact on the culture and viability of a franchisor? If you were the junior accountant how would you: identify and assess any risks to yourself? bring any concerns you had to the attention of third parties?  CONCLUDING REMARKS [5 MINUTES] With multi-unit franchise ownership and online purchasing on the rise, the RFG case exemplified many of the complex issues that the franchise business model has and will face. RFG, as a company, has an obligation to its shareholders to maximise dividends. The question raised through this case is how to do so, without destroying the profitability of the franchisees and the franchise business model.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  GLORIA JEAN’S FRANCHISEE 1.1 What due diligence would you recommend a franchisee do before they buy a franchised business? In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) requires franchisors to provide a disclosure document and information statement to prospective franchisees before the commencement of a 14-day waiting period. Franchisees are required to seek expert third-party advice during the 14-day waiting period.  The waiting period is followed by a 7-day cooling off period, post-signature of the franchise agreement.  Other important due diligence activities include:  Hiring a lawyer experienced in the franchise business model go through the franchise agreement and disclosure document.  Hiring an accountant experienced in the franchise business model to go through the financial documents provided by the franchisor, to give advice as needed and perform a credit check on the franchisor. Consultation with existing franchisees in the area. Ask existing franchisees about their relationship with the franchisor, the level of support, training and marketing provided and any of their concerns.   Make the time to observe other franchise businesses in the system operating under typical conditions. This will allow a prospective franchisee to get a gauge of traffic, staff attitudes, employee’s roles and marketing material etc Find out if there are any groups, social media sites or online forums where current or former franchisees talk about the franchisor. Look for customer reviews of existing franchise outlets on Google, Facebook, Zomato and Yelp.  Search court and media records to find any legal disputes involving the franchisor.  Take time to think about the decision.  Understand a franchisee’s legal rights. Be sure to read, and more importantly, understand the Franchising Code of Conduct.  1.2 What additional due diligence could the Ferraros have undertaken in the pre-contractual stage? In addition to speaking with the current franchisees whose details were provided by the franchisor, and consulting a lawyer and accountant during the pre-contractual phase, Maria and Luigi Ferraro should have: Sought out other existing franchisees in and around the area that were interested in opening their store and asked them about their relationship with the franchisor, the level of support, training and marketing provided and any of their concerns. Physically observed other franchise’s operating under typical conditions.  Checked to see if there were any groups, social media sites or online forums where current franchisees talk about the franchisor, Jireh International Pty Ltd. Ensured that the legal and accounting experts they spoke with understood the franchise business model.  Read customer reviews of existing outlets on Google, Facebook, Zomato and Yelp.  Searched court records to find any legal disputes involving the franchisor that were not included in the disclosure document.  Ensured that they understood their legal rights under the Franchising Code of Conduct.  1.3 What additional information, beyond that which is already mandated through the Franchising Code of Conduct, should prospective franchisees be provided with?  In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) includes the following provisions that are designed to protect prospective franchisees: 14-day pre-signature waiting period 7-day cooling off period  Compulsory provision of a disclosure document and information statement followed by 14-day waiting period.  An obligation for both parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith. A requirement to seek expert third-party advice.  Other information that may be useful for prospective franchisees includes:  A list of all current franchisees with their length of ownership and contact details.  A detailed breakdown of marketing levy income and expenditure. A 12-month marketing plan (local and national, if relevant). A detailed list of head office and support staff, duties and information on the number of stores that they look after.  A list of training opportunities made available to existing franchisees in the past 12-months and future 12-months.  The franchisor’s strategic business plans for next 12-36 months. Including new products, prices, growth etc.   1.4 How does franchise-specific law protect prospective franchisees? Are pre-contractual protections sufficient to protect franchisees from franchisor abuse? In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) includes the following provisions that are designed to protect prospective franchisees: 14-day pre-signature waiting period 7-day cooling off period  Compulsory provision of a disclosure document and information statement followed by 14-day waiting period.  An obligation to act in good faith, fair dealing and best and honest practices. A requirement to seek expert third-party advice.  The prevailing regulatory response to protection of franchisees focuses on information provision. Often, the regulator assumes that if the prospective franchisee has been provided with information necessary to inform themselves about the business model, then the prospective franchisee will be suitably equipped to look after their own interests. This is not the case, as the franchise agreement is often one-sided, providing the franchisor with the balance of power throughout the relationship. Further, as identified in final report published by the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on the Franchising Code of Conduct, it is possible for franchisors to engage in harmful but legal behaviour, such as churning and burning.  Instead of further regulatory intervention into the business model, there needs to be a greater focus on improving prospective franchisee’s education and awareness of the harsh realities of franchising and greater transparency into the franchisor’s operations and their experiences and relationships with current and past franchisees.  1.5 What other avenues of redress exist for franchisees in the Ferraro’s position? The Code requires the Ferraro’s to first attempt mediation with their franchisor, RFG. If this fails, the Ferraro’s have the following options:  initiate legal proceedings. initiate a class action, if they know that other franchisees are in the same position.  report breaches to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC has the power to investigate alleged breaches of the Franchising Code and take enforcement action, where appropriate. 1.6 How did the change in ownership at a franchisor level affect Gloria Jean’s franchisee? In many cases, prospective franchisees are drawn to a particular franchise brand by the enthusiasm and vision of the founder. The founder is often passionate and exceptionally knowledgeable about their brand and may even take a hands-on role in the day to day operations. However, when there is a change in ownership, from a founder, or family owned franchisor, to a company or investor-owned franchisor, this can have a significant impact on the culture of the franchise system. Often, the new owner will be concerned with ensuring a return on their investment and will seek to introduce their own ideas on how the system can be improved or perform more profitably. These ideas and changes may be considered good or bad by existing franchisees Whilst most franchise agreements, and specific legislation, restricts the ability of franchisors to unilaterally vary the terms of the franchise agreement, the franchisor is usually able to implement their new changes via the operations manual. This may involve upgrading the look and feel of the brand, new marketing initiatives and product lines which have a significant impact on, and cost to franchisees. In the 18-month period during which Jireh negotiated the sale of Gloria Jean’s to Global Yellow Pages (GYP) the franchisees were without head office support, a marketing strategy, strategic direction or momentum. The sale to GYP did not proceed and instead the brand was sold to Retail Food Group (RFG). Once the actual change of ownership to RFG occurred, there was an increased cost of goods sold to franchisees, increased turnover in support staff, the continual reinvention of the brand and strategy with every new CEO and compulsory fit out costs for updates to the franchisee’s stores.  1.7 Is the post-sale restraint of trade the Ferraro’s agreed to legally enforceable?  The Ferraro’s entered into their original franchise agreement with Jireh International Pty Ltd in 2011. The new Franchising Code of Conduct came into force on 1 January 2015. It altered the enforceability of restraint clauses in franchise agreements entered into, renewed, extended or varied after 1 January 2015. The Ferraro’s franchise agreement was entered into prior to this date, therefore they are subject to the Franchising Code of Conduct 1998.  In the context of franchise agreements, a restraint of trade clause is designed to prevent a franchisee going into direct competition with the franchisor at the conclusion or termination of their franchise agreement. These clauses are typically only enforceable if interpreted to be a reasonable means of protecting the franchisor’s goodwill at the time when the franchise agreement is made. Several factors influence the reasonableness of a restraint of trade clause. The interests and unique circumstances of both parties are considered. In order to be enforced, the restraint must afford no more than adequate protection to the franchisor and must not be injurious to the public. Some jurisdictions have restraint of trade legislation. For example, Restraints of Trade Act 1976Typically, courts recognise that franchisors have an interest in protecting their goodwill, which may be lost or diminished if the franchisee is permitted to compete following the conclusion of their agreement without restriction. In some circumstances, if there are adequate alternative contractual mechanisms within the franchise agreement, other than the restraint of trade clause, that are also designed to protect the interests of the franchisor, their goodwill and confidentiality of information, then the restraint of trade clause may be considered unreasonable. RETAIL FOOD GROUP  2.1 What are the obligations of RFG to Gloria Jean’s franchiseesWhen a change of ownership occurs, RFG, as the new franchisor, took on the rights of Jireh International Pty Ltd and also its obligations. However, the Franchising Code of Conduct (Code) does not outline a clear process to follow when there is a change in franchisor ownership.  Instead, it has been left to the parties to agree on the process that will be adhered to and is in compliance with the existing franchise agreement. The Code imposes an obligation on the existing franchisor to give notice of a change in materially relevant facts to franchisees and any prospective franchisee within a reasonable time (not exceeding 14 days) after becoming aware of that change (see clause 17 of the Code). A change in majority ownership or control is a materially relevant fact and therefore must be communicated to franchisees, as well as a change in the ownership or control of the intellectual property that is material to the franchise system.  2.2 What are the differences between unethical and unconscionable behaviour?  According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) ‘Unconscionable conduct does not have a precise legal definition as it is a concept that has been developed on a case-by-case basis by courts over time. Conduct may be unconscionable if it is particularly harsh or oppressive. To be considered unconscionable, conduct it must be more than simply unfair—it must be against conscience as judged against the norms of society.’ Further, the ACCC advises that ‘Business behaviour may be deemed unconscionable if it is particularly harsh or oppressive and is beyond hard commercial bargaining. There are a number of factors a court will consider when assessing whether conduct in relation to the selling or supplying of goods and services to a customer, or to the supplying or acquiring of goods or services to or from a business, is unconscionable.’ Factors that the courts may take into account when determining unconscionable behaviour include: the relative bargaining strength of the parties whether any conditions were imposed on the weaker party that were not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the stronger party whether the weaker party could understand the documentation used the use of undue influence, pressure or unfair tactics by the stronger party the requirements of applicable industry codes the willingness of the stronger party to negotiate the extent to which the parties acted in good faith. On the other hand, unethical behaviour refers to actions that don't conform to the acceptable standards of business operations.  It is important to understand that what is unethical may not always be illegal (though sometimes it is both). There are many instances where businesses may act within the law, but their actions hurt society and are generally considered to be unethical. This was pointed out by the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee’s final report in reference to the behaviour of the Retail Food Group executive management team. Other examples include exploiting workers and tax loopholes.  2.3 Has RFG acted unethically towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  The 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee’s final report was scathing in its assessment of the “unethical” and “incompetent” practices of RFG executive management. Their final report urged that RFG be investigated by the ACCC and the Australian Taxation Office for several potential breaches. According to the report, RFG seemed to knowingly mistreat franchisees and had “serious problems with the sustainability of the franchise model” and has “… damaged the reputation of franchising more broadly within Australia.” Other examples of unethical behaviour displayed by RFG in the lead up to and during the inquiry included repeatedly refused requests from the Parliamentary Inquiry Committee for documents that could demonstrate whether they knowingly sold failing franchise businesses to unwitting operators, allegations of churning and burning franchisees, overinflating the real costs of fit-outs and refurbishments to franchisee’s stores and misuse of marketing funds.  2.4 Has RFG acted unconscionably towards Gloria Jean’s franchisees?  While unconscionable conduct has not been proven, the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee’s final report recommended that regulators look into RFG broadly, but also those former executives in relation to possible legal breaches, insider trading, short selling, market disclosure obligations, compliance with directors’ duties, audit quality, valuation of assets, and tax avoidance. 2.5 Have RFG’s management team breached their legal obligations?  The Friedman Doctrine, or Shareholder Theory holds that a firm's only responsibility is to its shareholders. In Australia, shareholder primacy is paramount. Australia’s Corporations Act 2001 provides that a director owes a fiduciary duty to the company. Specifically, Section 181(1) requires that directors act ‘in good faith in the best interests of the corporation’. In practice, this means in the interests of the shareholders or members of the company as a whole. RFG’s management team have acted within the law, despite acting unethically towards their franchisees and without foresight in the context of ensuring that their business model would have long-term success. 2.6 Propose strategies to balance the objectives of shareholders in a franchised company and the needs of franchisees. In Australia, there have been multiple reviews into the statutory duties of directors and whether these should be changed to include a wider social responsibility.  ‘Corporate social responsibility’ and the concept that directors’ duties are owed to other key stakeholders such as franchisees, employees and creditors have been considered by CAMAC, the Australian government’s corporate advisory body. However, their recommendation is that no change be made to the existing legislation. Despite the fact that they do not have a legal obligation to act in the franchisee’s best interests, the executive management team of RFG should consider the interests and needs of franchisees when making all decisions for the brand.  Corporate goodwill and profitability are directly and inextricably related to the performance of a franchisee network and the franchisor’s profit (and therefore the shareholder profit) is directly derived from the turnover and success of the franchisees. Further, a franchisor’s reputation depends on the public perception and popularity of their system which is largely determined by the performance of its franchisees.  Franchisee dissatisfaction quickly becomes an infectious virus that can decimate a network. For sustained franchisor profitability and shareholder returns, the focus has to be directed to franchisee satisfaction and performance.  2.7 RECOMMENDATIONS: What are the most important changes that need to be made to RFG’s operations to ensure long-term success of both RFG and the franchisees of the 11 brands it controls? How can these changes be implemented to ensure long-term success? If you were thinking of global expansion where would your next move be to? RFG must shift its focus from short term return on investments to the success of franchisees and their brands. The needs of franchisees and the markets in which they operate need to be carefully considered and understood, then a plan to support the development and prosperity of the franchisees needs to be designed and implemented. The franchisees should be involved in this.  In its 2018 Annual Report, RFG acknowledged ‘FY18 has been a challenging year for RFG, however the Company is beginning to realise opportunities to better capitalise on the breadth of its operations to support a more sustainable business model for the Group and its franchisees.’ The company has identified a number of initiatives to transform the Group’s franchise business. These include:  rolling out additional revenue drivers for the Group and each Brand System, a relevant example being recent commencement of the rollout of Gloria Jean’s “Good Cup” initiative, which introduces new products, techniques and equipment to revolutionize the brand’s coffee offer and shopper experience, whilst driving additional earnings for franchisees;  a reinvigorated franchise and field support model which builds on the in-field support capability recently added to the network;  a revised distribution model which consolidates 16 current providers to better leverage the Group’s buying power;  a simplified product portfolio that enhances the quality and value of products provided to franchisee customers; and  enhanced digital and analytical capability, so that RFG has a more detailed understanding of the tastes and consumption patterns of consumers who shop with its franchisees.  RFG might want to consider putting any overseas expansion plans on hold until it is in a stronger position in the domestic market.  JUNIOR ACCOUNTANT  3.1 What are the responsibilities of a junior accountant to their employer, RFG?  The main responsibilities of an employee include: do the work that they were hired to do. In this case, Sarah’s role involved daily maintenance of franchisee files under the direction of a manager; including issuance of invoices to franchisees for payment of the various fees owed to RFG, performance of reconciliations and regular communication with the franchisee who’s accounts she managed.  do their work carefully and seriously.  avoiding putting themselves or others in danger.  following their employer's instructions, with the exception of undertaking dangerous or illegal activity. 3.2 What are the responsibilities of RFG to its junior accountant?  In NSW, and all states and territories in Australia, the law requires an employer to provide a high standard of safety and health at the workplace to ensure that employees are not injured or harmed because of their work The employer's 'duty of care' includes protecting the junior accountant from both physical hazards and 'psychosocial' workplace hazards (for example, workplace bullying, illegal activity and aggression). 3.3. What are the ethical issues facing the junior accountant?  Ethically, she has an obligation to:  avoid conflicts of interest; maintain her client's confidentiality; avoid contributing to the perpetration of unlawful acts; ensure her clients are well informed through the provision of comprehensive and accurate advice; ensure her clients understand the advice, and have the capacity to act; be respectful.  As she is a member of CPA Australia, she is subject to the APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants. This Code of Ethics provides guidance on the appropriate response for professional accountants who come across suspected unlawful activity on the part of their client or employer. Where illegal activity is suspected, under the Code of Ethics the accountant is advised to: explain to the client or employer the potential illegality of the arrangement and get them to stop that activity; suggest alternative, legal ways in which the client’s needs might be met; disclose the activity if there is a legal obligation to do so; if the client or employer does not change the suspect behaviour, then resign from the engagement or employment; if disclosure is not mandatory, the accountant should consider whether, in their professional assessment, disclosure is warranted in the public interest. If their professional assessment is that disclosure is in the public interest, they are strongly advised to seek legal advice before proceeding. Sarah must let her supervisor know that an unlawful act may have been committed and advise them of their rights. Sarah should advise her supervisor on potential responses to the situation, satisfy herself that her supervisor understands their rights and the advice, and then seek instructions, confirmed in writing. An ethical dilemma Sarah faces is whether or not to blow the whistle on RFG’s unethical conduct. On the one hand, Sarah’s information could cause RFG to fail or lose much of its stock value and goodwill overnight. That could hurt the already suffering franchisees and/ put her co-workers out of work and into financial jeopardy. Sarah could also face backlash from her manager and threats to her reputation, that have the potential to affect her career. 3.4 How does high staff turnover impact on the culture and viability of a franchisor?High staff turnover impacts the culture and viability of the franchise organisation in number of ways:  Impact on revenue:Employee turnover has a direct impact on company revenue and profitability. For example, the estimated cost of every lost employee is between $5,000 to $40,000, with the amount varying depending on hiring expenses, training costs, lost sales and productivity. If a severance payout is applicable, there is no return on investment. There are also labour costs for human resources staff in placing new recruitment ads, reviewing applications, interviewing and training.  Low employee morale: Low employee morale may stem from overworked employees who have had to take on increased workloads and responsibilities to cover for staff shortages. Deteriorating service quality: Lower productivity and sub-par service quality provided through low overall numbers of service staff or inexperienced staff, to franchisees can cause a disruption to their daily operations.  3.5 If you were the junior accountant how would you: identify and assess any risks to yourself? Here are some common signs that a workplace is not a positive work environment: employee sickness,employee burnout, fatigue, and illness resulting from high levels of stress;narcissistic leadership, managers whodo not take feedback on board or endeavour to ensure that their employees are supported and heard;low levels of enthusiasm among staff;lack of communication or negative communication between managers and their staff;high staff turnover.  To manage the risks to herself, Sarah should:  document everything she does bysaving emails and recording in a diary, dated, comments and decisions from meetings, phone calls, and managers that she interacts with. plan her exit strategy. It is possible that things could improve at the RFG head office, in which case it might make sense to stay. However, in the meantime, Sarah should begin her search for a new job.  3.6 Reporting to third parties?  There are situations that can occur that cause accountants to consider making a report to regulators. Whilst there is not always a legal obligation to bring a concern to the attention of a third party, it should be considered if there is a \"public interest\" in doing so.  Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Act 2019 (Cth)1317AAA defines ‘eligible whistleblowers’ and provides some protection to them: A CPA certified accountant can also look to the CPA Australia Whistleblower Policy that supports the reporting of allegations of serious wrongdoing (“Reportable Conduct”) by CPA Australia, CPA Australia personnel or CPA Australia’s independent auditors. The Whistleblower Policy provides information on an accountant’s rights and obligations throughout any investigation process. The policy seeks to provide clarity on what constitutes Reportable Conduct, as well as the framework CPA Australia has established to manage and support the whistleblowing process.  Examples of serious wrongdoing (“Reportable Conduct”) includes the following:  dishonest, corrupt or illegal activities;  theft, fraud, money laundering or misappropriation;  a serious breach of the Group’s policies and procedures;  offering or accepting a bribe;  use of Group funds or Group resources in a manner that falls within the scope of Reportable Conduct;  damage/sabotage, violence, drug & alcohol sale/use;  risks to the health and safety of workers;  unethical conduct;  bullying, discrimination, harassment or abuse;  victimising someone for reporting Reportable Conduct;  recrimination against someone because they participated in an investigation or review;  any instruction to cover up or attempt to cover up serious wrongdoing.

The research is based on the theories of the New Institutional Economy, the Signals and the Resources and Capabilities. Data were collected from 6,141 survivors and bankrupt franchisor companies the commerce and service sectors reported by Entrepreneur 500 Magazine titled 500 franquicias of year 2006 to 2015, as well as from official reports of the Ministry of Economy (ME), also contemplating the edges of the institutional environment, franchise associations, consultants and government rules including a specific business promotion program for this sector, a multivariate economic model for prediction of failure was constructed based on a longitudinal analysis, using a multiple discriminant model. The main findings made it possible to determine among thirteen variables that the membership to an association, the accreditation of a consultant, the age of the company before franchising, the number of units before franchising, the percentage of royalties and the size of the network better discriminated between the two study groups. This work adds three stages and seven new variables to the model of franchise success proposed by Nijmeijer, Fabbricotti and Huijsman (2014), which have scarcely been empirically or jointly studied in national or international research. Key words: The New Institutional Economy theory, the Signals theory, the Resources and Capabilities theory, failure, franchise models, México. Introduction Mexico is considered one of the most developed markets in Latin America (Fadairo and Lachimba, 2017) thanks to stability and steady growth (AMF, cited by D.C., USA, 2018).  During the period 2006 – 2016 Mexican franchisor companies and outlets experienced a growth rate of more than 200% (Cortes, 2019). This contributed between 6% and 10 % to the GDP (Guerrero, Armenteros and Medina, 2014, D.C., USA., 2016). However, the failure rate was of more than 10% in Mexican franchises in the commerce and services sectors during the period 2006-2014. This situation affected more than 10,326 outlets, but there aren’t any studies that have determined the causes of the failure of Mexican franchisors, representing a gap in the information about the factors that caused such failure. Most of the impact falls on the franchisees, since many took out loans in order to obtain the franchises. Some invested in companies that were not ready to franchise (Jalife, 2016). Franchisor failure also affects the suppliers, creditors, employees, among others. This situation also enveloped franchise consultants, who were part of the Mexican Franchise Association (MFA).  Representatives of the public and private sectors, consultants and the MFA together developed the basis for the National Program of Franchises (NPF) (SE, 2012; Feher, 2015). The program was considered ineffective in achieving the its objectives (only 40% in the new Mexican franchisors the franchisees units and jobs generated were under 1%) in spite of having offered financial loans with a 0% interest rate during a six-year period (Cortes, 2019). In addition, the MFA was ranked last out of 46 countries as far as ethical content is concerned (Gámez, Díez de Castro, Navarro and Rondán, 2008), and has room for improvement in its administrative Management. Franchisor membership rates were under 30%. Furthermore, the MFA had internal disagreements which paved the way for the appearance of new franchise associations, fragmenting the information of the sector (Cortés, 2019). There also exist glaring conflicts of interests among franchise representatives (Abell, 2013). Further, failed franchisee data have been hidden or minimized by the franchisors themselves (Díez and Rondán, 2004), or have been manipulated to exclude inefficient enterprises that have changed owners multiple times (Jalife, 2013). Even though Mexico has laws for the franchise sector. The legislation, regulation and guidelines is weak, such as insufficient contract registration at the National Institute of Industrial Property (NIIP)   (only 21% in a ten-year period) (Cortes, 2019). Varying degrees of MFA obstruction of regulations have been detected in the chamber of deputies and senators: a lack of measures obliging franchisors to declare bankruptcy or lawsuit by franchisees; lack of validation in the content of franchise disclosure documents (Dodge, 2014), and difficulty during conciliation processes due to various improvements needed in contracts, manuals and franchisor supervision (Cortes, 2019). As a result, new companies appear which, after calling themselves franchises, develop new ways to commit fraud (Senado de la República, 2017). This makes it easy to gain access to inexperienced companies (Jalife, 2013). Besides, In México the small and medium-sized enterprises were characterized by low productivity (OECD, 2013), with inefficiencies in: a) management capabilities, b) training, c) use of performance indicators and human resources, and d) technological lag, among others (Enaproce, 2015). Mexico’s commerce and services sector registered the highest company birth and death rates (INEGI, 2018), and were also last place in productivity levels (OECD, 2017a) compared to 26 other OECD countries. Franchise model failure has received little attention in Mexico (Young and McIntyre, 2011, Buchan and Frazer, 2013). In the international context, literature related to the failure of franchisor companies has been focused on several internal factors, with insufficient integration of contextual factors such as institutional pressures (Combs Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2009), the economy, society (Perrigot, Cliquet and Mesbah, 2004), governmental impact (Beere, 2017), financial support from the Federal Government (Ayup and Cavazos, 2015) or external certifications (Bordonaba et al., 2009). In spite of the fact that these factors can affect franchisor results (Frazer, Merrilees and Wright, 2007; Grewal, Iyer, Rajshekhar and Radulovich, 2011), the meager empirical research conducted to date has not yet shown clarity when integrating them. All of the above leads us to doubt the feasibility of these factors being put together in a success model for franchises (Nijmeijer et  In Spanish, Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrialal., 2014). Hence, it is necessary to combine several theories and disciplines to address the challenge (Barthelemy, 2011; Samsudim et al., 2018; Gillis and Castrogiovanni, 2012; Dant, 2008; Combs, Ketchen, Shook and Short, 2011). The aim of this study is to determine the internal and external factors influencing the failure of the Mexican franchisors. In the external factors we use levels 1, 2 and 3 of the theory of the New Institutional Economy (NIE) (Williamson, 2000) with a group of nine hypotheses that refer to the customs and traditions of informal institutions (affiliation to an association, accreditation of a franchise consultant), the institutional environment (laws in Mexico and regulation of the Disclosure Document), the governance structure (franchisor accredited by a government program, age and units before franchising). Also, we use level four of the NEI (NIEt) and the Signalss theories (St) (Gallini y Lutz, 1992) in two hypotheses about the data that Mexican franchisors use to market their franchise model (franchise fee and royalty rate).  Finally, we employed of the Resources and Capabilities (RCt) (Barney, 1991) and level 4 of the NIE (Williamson, 2000) theories in four hypotheses. Its involve the management of the franchise network (growth, network size, professionalized staff , training of the franchisor's staff and managerial capabilities of the Mexican franchisor). Our research baseline is to propose a multivariate econometric model of failure prediction, providing variables for the conceptual franchise success and failure model proposed by the Nijmeijer et al. (2014) to identify, analyze and correlate the factors causing the downfall of Mexican franchisors. In light of the above, a quantitative explanatory, longitudinal study was performed, encompassing 6,141 failed and survivors’ Mexican franchisors in the commerce and services sector from 2006 to 2014. Section two provides the analytical framework, the conceptual background and hypotheses, the hypothetical analysis model, and the variables used. Section three describes the methodology, treatment of data and statistic design. Section four presents results, conclusions, the proposal for a conceptual model of the success and failure of franchisors in Mexico, and finally, an examination of future implications. Section II. Analytic framework Franchisor’s failure has been minimized by the defenders of the sector, resulting in scarce academic (Macías, 2015), scientific (Morris, 2006), professional and governmental attention (Buchan, 2013). Buchan et al. (2015) affirm that franchisor failure is continuous, international; making it necessary to conduct research in different markets in The United States (Dant, Perrigot and Cliquet, 2008). In this sense, Buchan et al. (2015) agreed to identified a need for do more empirical work concerning franchisor failure using multidisciplinary, inter-jurisdictional, intercultural and longitudinal focuses on the entire sector.  This led to the need for a more profound and complete understanding of the complexities and nuances of such, as well as why other franchisors do prosper (Combs, Ketchen, Shook and Short, 2011). Also, Barthelemy (2011) and Varotto and Aureliano-Silva (2017) detected insufficient studies on the institutional perspective (sector regulation), Pfister, Deffains, Doriat-Duban and Saussier (2006) discovered in their earlier study how institutions do affect the growth rate of franchises in nine countries. Facanha et al. (2013) suggested exploration of the New Institutional Economy Theory (NIET) (Williamson, 2000) in failure studies, since it analyzes the importance of institutions in the economic changes of people and companies resulting from economic policies present in four levels. Moreover, Fernández and Gutiérrez (2011) agreed upon the absence of an academically accepted theory explaining the empirical study of business failure due to the objectives, research design, an elevated dispersion by the diversity of variables selected to integrate a model (De Andrés, 2000). Several works also confirmed the absence of a perfect model of failure prevention, since most of them possess both positive and negative aspects (Macías, 2015). Buchan (2013) declared that there is a great range of causes of franchisor failure Macías (2015) grouped them by analysis levels: 1) the businessperson’s profile and that of his/her company, 2) the selected strategy for the new company, and 3) the influence of the environment on the new company. Meanwhile, Rodriguez-Rad and Navarro-García (2007) classified the causes according to a) moral risk, b) activity risk, c) political and economic risk, and d) risk of failure. Nevertheless, our research will be based in the stages that spur franchisor failure have been classified 1) pre-franchising, 2) franchisor model development and marketing 4) franchisor network development as proposed by Cortes (2019). Conceptual background and hypotheses Membership by the Mexican Association of Franchises The NIE theory in level 1, states the truth about how a sector must be conducted by the institutions (Willianson, 2000), generating connections and measures with complementary institutions in order to protect themselves and to influence the decisions made by entrepeneurs (Barthelemy, 2011., Doherty et al. 2014). Therefore, institutional isomorphism has become a established and spreaded between organizations (Zucker, 1988). Combs et al. (2009) agreed that associations and consultants produce mimetic pressure on the Mipymes (Combs et al., 2009). Furthermore, Shane and Spell (1998) sustained that the belinging to an association of franchises provides a quality guarantee, and reduces the probability of failure for the franchisor. Hence, : The membership of The Mexican Association of Franchises is positively related to the Mexican franchisor’s success. Lincense of a certified consultant by the National Program of Franchises The institucionalization of the franchising sector is greater when third parties interfere, such as commercial editors and consultant companies (Lounsbury quoted by Combs et al., 2009). The franchising consultants support is the clue to improve the franchisors performance (Samsudin et al.2018) in order to have a sustainable industry through professional solid and vital assistance during the first stages of the franchisor. The NPF favored the increasement (350%) of franchises consultants (Cortes, 2019). Only 11 consultants could license more than 4 million Micro, Small and Medium business (MSMEs) during the period of 2006 to 2012. The license by the franchisor allowed the Access to loans for their franchisees. Therefore, : Having a license provided by a PNF certified consultant is positively related to the Mexican franchisor business success. Regulation in the Mexican franchising sector The NIE theory in level 2, involves the definition and execution of the formal norms (rules, regulation, executive, legislative, juridical and bureaucratic functions,of the government) needed for the economic productivity of a country (Willianson, 2000). The misapplied laws ease the deceivement to the franchised (Purvin, 2008), just as the wrong management of a conflict (Wang, Grünhagen, Ji, & Zheng, 2020). An excess of the sector regulation is not desireable for the franchisors (Hoffman et al., 2016), due to the positive impacto f a low regulation and propitious over them (Samsudin et al., 2018). Thus, : The regulation of the Franchising sector in Mexico (LPI) is positively related to the Mexican franchisors net expansion and success.  Disclosure Document regulation (DD regulation) The franchisee makes uncertain decisions about the frachisor’s solvency (Buchan and Frazer, 2011), since the previous information in the DD does not anticipate, nor does it address the consequencies of the franchisor’s administration (Buchan, 2013). Quality is more important than quantity when providing information during the initial stage and before the contract of the franchise (Atwell, 2015). Therefore, : The regulation of the Disclosure Document is positively related to the franchisor’s net expansion and business success. Franchisor licensed by the National Progran of Franchises (NPF) The NIE theory in level 3, contemplates the rules of the governing game through the government institutions, in order to mitigate conflicts and obtain mutual profits (Willianson, 2000). The sociopolitical legitimity acknowledges the enterprises (Aldrich y Fiol citado por Rodríguez-Rad y Navarro-García, 2007) and eases the access to resources (Aldrich y Auster, 1986) from outer media that favor the franchisor’s survival (Shane y Foo, 1999) through business growth programs. Hence, : Being part of the licensed franchisors by the NPF, has a positive relation with net expansion and business success. Age and number of sales items of the franchisor before franchising The NPF asked the candidate enterprises for two requirements before franchising: a) having at least 2 years of antiquity before franchising and b) operating with two or more own units with excellent results (SE, 2012). Since the experience “is a sustainability and validation test of the business concept” \"(Jeremías 2016, p. 46), turning the model of business into a proved and solved concept (Buchan et al., 2015), steady and lasting (Weaven et al., 2018; Buchan y Frazer, 2013), besides the belonging to a known trademark. : A minor age before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net expansion and business success. : A low number of units before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net expansión and business success. Franchise fee and franchisor´s royalties during the commercialization stage. The NIE theory in level 4 depicts how the first three levels in enterprises influence, since these have a productive fuction with a purpose and economic effect (Willianson, 2000). On the other hand, the benefits or the success of a business model are sent through messages (Signals theory) to the potential franchisee people, through the opening of own units, and a high royalty rate or franchise fee (Gallini y Lutz, 1992). However, the franchisors offer initial fees and costs in order to get a greater growth (Shane, Shankar y Aravindakshan, 2006) The policy of free prices should allow the incipient franchisors to accelerate the recruitment of the franchisees (Tsang y Finnegan, 2013). Ergo, we proceed: : A low franchise fee in chain stores with a minor age before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net expansion during the model commercialization and business success. A low royalty rate in enterprises with a minor age before franchising has a positive relation with the franchisor’s net growth during the commercialization of the franchise model and business success. Franchise net growth The RC theory (Barney, 1991) explains the competitive advantage and growth by assuming that enterprises are heterogeneous, given that they possess unique resources and capacities. In this way, the expansion of the franchise net facilitates the franchisor’s survival (Shane y Foo, 1999). There exists a close relation between growth and size or the net (Polo-Redondo, Bordonaba-Juste y Palacios, 2011); however, the quick expansion in younger franchise chains with higher rates of franchised units has high mortality rates as well (Dobbs, et al, 2012) because they grow under the limit of efficiency (Martin, 1988) due to an inadequate growth or the lack of a constant growth rate. Therefore, : A greater growth of the net related to the low franchise fee, the low royalty rate, the low number of units and the low age before franchising, has a positive relation with the franchisor’s business success. :  A greater size of the net related to the low franchise fee, the low royalty rate, the low number of units and the low age before franchising, has a positive relation with the franchisor’s business success. Franchisor’s professional and competent staff The franchisor’s Manpower is important (Meng-Yh, Jer-Yan, Tzy-Yih y Tomas, 2010), because they provide support and technical assistance to the franchisees. Besides, they design and administrate the supply chain of the net (Navarro y Puig, 2017), and take active intangible part (Perdreau, Nadant y Cliquet, 2015), due to the adjustment between them (the franchisoer’s staff) and the way they deal and lend the service (to the franchisee), is what determines the survival of the franchisor (Weaven et al., 2018). Therefore, : The franchisor’s professionalized and competent staff has a positive relation with the management of a big-sized net and business success. Franchisor’s staff training The correct manner in which Manpower is used is the one that creates competitive advantages (Gillis y Combs, 2009), since a correct execution (Hoffman y Preble, 2003) is linked to success and net growth (Unger et al, 2011), influencing potential decisions taken by new franchisors and generated by the investment in resources and capabilities on the franchisor’s part (Gillis, 2007), therefore we predict, : The training of franchisor personnel is positively related to the management of a big network and the success of the Mexican franchisor Manager capabilities of the franchisor entrepreneur The franchisor is an entrepeneur who built the business model. This person has the experience of having started a business (Jeremiah, 2016) by showing sustainability and validation of its concept (Macías, 2015). Therefore, he/she is someone one can learn from (Grünhagen , González-Díaz , Hussain & Monteiro da Silva Filho, 2020): is assumed that he has abilities, as a manager too (WEF, 2014); as the efficient use of performance indicators and the ability of solution by implementing improvement actions (Enaproce, 2015), to provide sustainability to the net and to the business itself (Frazer et al., 2014; Croonen and Broekhuizen, 2017). Therefore, The manager capabilities of the entrepreneur has a positive relation with the management of a big-sized net (total units) and franchisor’s success. Internal and external factors in the determination of the franchisor’s failure Several studies have suggested to broaden investigations about the importance of the context in determining the failure of the franchisor; such as: a) institutional pressures institucionales (Combs et al., 2009), b) the society (Samsudin et al., 2018), c) the legal situation of a country (Perrigot et al., 2004), d) the government impact (Beere, 2017), and e) the financial supports from the government and the external certifications (Bordonaba et al., 2009). The latter allows to infere that literatura has not clearly demonstrated to include context factors inside a model of success factors in the franchises. (Nijmeijer et al., 2014). Thus, There is a preponderant difference between the context factors and the own factors of the Enterprise, determining the failure of the Mexican franchisor during the period of 2005-2014. Hypothetical model and hypotheses In this paper, we propose the following correlation of theories for the analysis of The Mexican franchisor failure suggested by Hoffman, Munemo and Watson (2016) (see figure (see Figure 1).

This lack of legal harmonization amongst the different jurisdictions is exacerbated by the absence of an international regime governing mandatory disclosure of information to would-be franchisees before the franchise agreement is concluded, meaning that enterprising franchisors may seek out jurisdictions with little to no protective regulation, engaging in sharp practices, whilst prospective franchisees have no means of securing key information and legal redress.  This paper asks whether the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has a role to play in filling this regulatory void, by developing a regime obliging franchisors to provide key information to prospective franchisees in the period leading-up to the conclusion of a franchise agreement? This paper looks at the current system in light of literature on mandatory disclosure in the field of regulation, to show that this system is inadequate. In light of these gaps, this paper advocates the position that the UNCITRAL should work alongside UN member states to design and develop a mandatory disclosure regime. After looking at the current regulatory framework (part 1), exploring the concerns associated with absence of an international mandatory disclosure regime (part 2) and considering the value of introducing an international regime of mandatory disclosure (part 3), I ask whether this is the type of project the UNCITRAL should consider (part 4). In the concluding segment of this paper, I explore the framework the UNCITRAL should consider introducing to protect prospective franchisees and optimise their investment decision-making process.

Between 1975 and 1985, the number of US firms with overseas outlets doubled from 175 (in 1972) to 342 (in 1985) and the number of overseas outlets grew from 6153 (in 1972) to 30188 (in 1985). Most of the domestic growth in the US happened between 1960-4 (halving in the period 1965-9) with international growth picking up the relay in 1970-5  Some suggest that the concept of a franchise as a commercial arrangement can be traced back to the Norenkai system in the 1600s in Japan, whilst others suggest the tied house system used in Germany and the United Kingdom, in the 1700s. (Hackett 1976)  Hackett 1976: 66-7; Mendelsohn 2004: 16. Domestic growth data on a country-by-country basis is provided by UNIDROIT. (UNDROIT Guide 2007: 256-262) Nowadays, franchising contributes significantly to the GDP of many nations - United Kingdom (£15.1 billion), Germany (€48 billion) and France (€47.6 billion) (Abell 2013: 1, citing French Franchise Federation Report 2010) According to recent data, there are now in excess of 12,000 franchised brands in Europe with over 500,000 franchised units which employ roughly 3 million employees.(Boulay 2020: 49 citing European Franchise Federation, 2019)  Kostecka 1987; Brickley, Dark and Weisbach 1991: 27. - a decade on from the period of domestic boom. Fast food is the leading sector in terms of domestic and international growth; accounting for highest number of new units opened over the period 1970-5 (22.4% domestically and internationally), with both the soft drinks and business services sectors exhibiting substantially growth over the same period (accounting for 12.9% and 10.6% of the international and domestic growth respectively).The reasons why franchisors seek to expand using franchising are diverse. Diversification, customer-retention, access to new markets, financing and new know-how are amongst the leading factors in this move to expand internationally. Such expansion affords established franchisors an opportunity to reduce their reliance on domestic markets, to diversify their revenue streams and to help guarantee new revenue streams during periods of economic downturn. According to recent data, the vast majority of US franchisors (63 percent) seek out international franchisees due to domestic market saturation and the attractiveness of untapped markets. International franchising exists in over sixteen industries, but the main industries in which franchisors are seeking international franchisees are the food retail, hotels and motels, and recreation. With the help of enterprising and invested national entrepreneurs familiar with the target market, franchisors are able to gain a established foothold in new untapped markets. This strategy yields financial benefits (royalties, ongoing payments for stock and services, lump sums) providing access to human capital, manpower, know-how, investment and funding opportunities, and helping build up brand recognition and market share. Whilst also, ensuring existing clientele have access to their outlets whilst they are travelling, guaranteeing them a consistent experience and familiar level of comfort rather than running the risk of losing them to competitors.Part one – Current regulatory framework (structure and justifications)  Hackett 1976: 66; Brickley, Dark and Weisbach 1991: 27.

The regulation of franchising is a fairly recent phenomenon with California State reported to be the first jurisdiction to introduce regulation governing franchises.  Currently, regulation is purely domestic in origin, though there is growing recognition of the importance of regulating cross-border franchise activity. Over the past 50 years, three regulatory regimes have emerged governing the offer and roll-out of franchises: Disclosure, registration and relationship. In jurisdictions with registration regulation typically franchisors are obliged to register and file documents before advertising for franchisees, with a public body entrusted with the power to oversee registration. Regimes with relationship statute guarantee franchisees certain key protections, protecting them against certain contingencies that may arise during the term of the franchise relationship and at the end of the relationship. In this paper, I focus on mandatory disclosure and look at the merits of this regulatory regime and how it can be used to enhance cross-border franchise activity. Some jurisdictions use mandatory disclosure regulation alone. Others – such as Californiause such regulation alongside other regulatory regimes; most commonly registration regimes which require franchisors to register before offering franchises for sale. Typically coupled with a pre-contractual ‘cooling off’ period, mandatory disclosure regulation is used in jurisdictions worldwide, including the United States (at the federal level – FTC Rule and in a number of states), France, Italy, and Canada (in a number of provinces including Alberta, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and more recently British Columbia). Generally, in these jurisdictions, disclosure takes place within a defined period before the date on which the prospective franchisee is due to sign the franchise agreement or to pay money towards the franchise providing the prospective franchisees with the time to withdraw from negotiations. These periods vary in length ranging from fourteen to thirty days. In 1971, California State introduced a disclosure and registration statute. Shortly after California, federal legislation introduced a disclosure statute. The legislation in California influenced other states in the US to introduce similar legislation and inspired Ontario, to introduce disclosure statute.  Non-legislative instruments have been developed by UNIDROIT and a number of franchise associations.   A pioneer in the field of franchise regulation, the legislature in California introduced the California Franchise Investment Law (CFIL),a registration and disclosure statute [C § 31000 (West 1977)]. Inspired by US securities legislation, in the State of California, legislatures have introduced legislation which provides for disclosure and registration, obliging franchisor to register their documentation governing the sale and operation of a franchise with a governing body with oversight powers. In addition, the California Franchise Relations Act (CFRA) governs the relationship between the franchisee and franchisor throughout the contract lifecycle [C § 20000 (West1981)].  Doubin law no 89-1008 of 31 December 1989 now Article L330-3 of the Commercial Code.  Italian Franchising Law (n.129/2004) Each province in Canada has jurisdiction to regulate franchising. Six provinces have adopted franchise legislation (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island). See also, RONALD ARDNERRANCHISINGEALITIES AND EMEDIES 84 (Law Journal Press ed. 2003) [hereinafter GARDNER Fourteen days in Ontario (A5(1), Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, SO 2000, c 3) and Alberta (A4(2), Franchises Act, RSA 2000, c F-23). Twenty days in France (Article L330-3). Thirty days in Italy (Article 4, Italian Franchising Law n.129/2004) Mandatory disclosure regimes typically oblige franchisors to provide would-be franchisees with a written pre-contractual disclosure covering a number of stipulated items. This bird’s-eye view of the franchise covers three fields of information: The franchisor (its obligations and business credentials), the franchisee (its obligations and financial commitments) and the franchise. Such disclosure covers strategic information regarding the franchisor, including current and past litigation and bankruptcies, addressing the franchisee’s financial commitments (initially and on an ongoing basis) and obligations, alongside the franchisor’s obligations. Other items covered include financing, intellectual propertyand other items pertinent to a potential franchisee’s decision to purchase. A failure to provide such a disclosure, will typically be deemed an unfair or deceptive act or practice.Such a disclosure is typically made using a template Disclosure Document accompanied by the draft franchise agreement and any other relevant contractual documentation. Similar regimes are used in United States since the 1970s in California State and at the federal level. The first State in the United States to introduce disclosure and registration regulation, California has inspired many other jurisdictions in their regulatory journey. Pursuant to rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission in 1979 (amended in 2007), a franchisor must furnish would-be franchisees with a FDD (franchise disclosure document), at least 14 calendar days before a  The obligations and business credentials of the franchisor (items 1-4, 19-21), the obligations and financial commitments of the franchisee and the franchise itself (items 5-18), including details about the competitive nature of the market where the franchisee will be operating.  16 C.F.R. § 436.5(a) (2018). For a discussion on the items, see Uri Benoliel, Are Disclosures Really Standardized?, 62 VILL. L. REV. 1 (2017).    In the US, this is capable of amounting to a violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act - 16 C.F.R. § 436.2 (2007).  In France, for example, Loi Doubin, proposed by Minister Doubin in 1989, requires frank disclosure at least 20 days before the date assigned for signing the contract - Such disclosure must be made in a Disclosure Document accompanied by the draft agreement. (Emerson 2021) The disclosure statutes in Alberta and Ontario oblige franchisors to disclose set information and key documents to would-be franchisees 14 days before the signing of the agreement or the payment of consideration (whichever is the earlier). Failure to do so will result in a right to rescind. Misrepresentation will permit a claim for damages. Though Quebec has no dedicated franchise regulation, the Civil Code of Quebec obliges franchisors to bring external contractual clauses contained in documents outside the franchise agreement (such as the operational manual) to the attention of the would-be franchisee during the bargaining phase. (9150-0595 Québec inc. v. Franchises Cora inc., 2013 QCCA 531)  The legislature in California introduced two bodies of regulation protecting the interests of potential and actual franchisees: A registration and disclosure statute, The California Franchise Investment Law (CFIL) - C § 31000 (West 1977) – and relationship statute, the California Franchise Relations Act (CFRA) - C § 20000 (West1981). Several years after the introduction of the CFIL, a disclosure statute was introduced at the federal level, promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and commonly referred to as the FTC Rule - 16 C.F.R. § 436.1 (2007) – this regulation applies in each one of the fifty states, the District of Columbia and all US territories in line with the Supremacy Clause in the US Constitution (Babette Marzheuser-Wood & Brian Baggott, Franchise Law in the US, Dentons p2 (2015). U.S.ONST. art. VI, cl. 2.) binding agreement is signed, addressing 23 key fields of information (known as ‘disclosure items’). The information that must be included in the FDD is comprehensive in nature and is intended to give the prospective franchisee a panoramic view of the franchise, thus ensuring that the would-be franchisee has an all-encompassing prospective of the franchise and its infrastructure.  Part two – Concerns associated with the current international mandatory disclosure regime  Due to the lack of harmonisation amongst the different jurisdictions, where regulation does exist the levels of protection afforded to prospective franchisees differ from one jurisdiction to another. Even varying from one province to another within the same country. In those jurisdictions with no legal framework such as the United Kingdom, would-be franchisees have no dedicated system of rights and remedies tailored to the franchise relationship, leaving aggrieved parties to look to general law for solutions, and franchisors have no obligation to furnish would-be franchisees with information and documentation regarding the franchise. In such situations, the parties will often have no specific rights and obligations during the period leading-up to the signing of the franchise agreement and throughout the relationship. As such, an aggrieved prospective franchisee who suffers a loss during the pre-contractual phase will need to look to general law for protection and redress. Depending on the act or omission that has caused the loss and the laws of the jurisdiction involved, she may be able to look to for example to contract law (misrepresentations), criminal law (fraud), tort and if available, the laws obliging the parties to exercise good faith. What is more, in cases involving cross-border negotiations of franchises, where the franchisee and franchisor are based in different  FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, FRANCHISE RULE 16 C.F.R. PART 436 COMPLIANCE GUIDE (May 2008), https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/bus70-franchise-rule-compliance-guide.pdf.  Unless a transaction is exempted under the FTC Rule, where there is an offer or sale of a franchise situated in the United States or its territories, the prospective franchisee must be furnished with an FDD 'at least 14 calendar-days before the prospective franchisee signs a binding agreement with, or makes any payment to, the franchisor or an affiliate in connection with the proposed franchise sale.’  § 436.2(a).  This 14 (calendar) day period starts on the day after the delivery of the FDD; in other words, the signing of the agreement or the receipt of payment can only take place on or after the 15th calendar day following delivery. (FRADE OMPLIANCE UIDE20).  Item 23 is merely procedural and is a requirement that franchisors obtain a signed receipt from each prospective franchisee confirming receipt of the FDD and accompanying exhibits.  In Canada, Ontario, Alberta and Prince Edward Island are amongst the only provinces to have introduced law governing the rights of franchisees to disclosure of information.   The contractual relationship between the parties in jurisdictions without dedicated laws governing franchises will be governed by private law (the terms of the franchise agreement and any associated agreements) and general law (common law if applicable, code, and/or statute). Such agreements are typically drafted by the franchisor and offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis to prospective franchisees.  jurisdictions, it is not always clear which body of law governs the negotiation process and the contract itself (in the absence of a choice by the parties themselves), as such the rights of the prospective franchisee during the negotiation phase will be unclear which may open her up to potential abuse.The absence of a harmonised system of international regulation coupled with the variations in domestic regulation and the lack of international regulatory bodies in this field result in a number of problems. Firstly, A high degree of legal divergence creates technical barriers with a potential of discouraging expansion into new markets impeding cross-border commerce and synergies, limiting consumer choice, undermining effective competition and hindering domestic growth and job creation.313233 The technical barriers created by these divergences in regulation have the potential of discouraging franchisees and franchisors from expanding their respective operations across borders, adversely affecting cross-border activity, impeding integration of markets, and limiting consumer choice.Secondly, the present system of self-regulation used in many jurisdictions lacks clarity and consistent enforcement, and is heavily weighted in favour of franchisors, which coupled with the lack of uniformity amongst the national franchise laws, has a dampening effect on the efforts of franchisors looking to roll out across different markets creating barriers to cross-border activity and synergies. Thirdly, the lack of uniformity acts as a potential impediment to cross-border synergies, impeding the flow of commerce and trade from one jurisdiction to another. Franchises often involve not only a provision of service and the licensing of IP but also the sale of goods by the franchisor or their approved suppliers to the franchisees. Fourthly, this situation  National law is applied to an international franchise agreement by virtue of the parties’ election or by virtue of the law applicable in the absence of such an agreement between the parties on governing law. (Stetsiuk et al 2018: 334)  Wai 2002: 251.  These are enumerated in a study prepared in 2016 for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, and in the Resolution of the European Parliament released in 2017. In a union of twenty-seven Member States (post withdrawal by the UK), only six Member States have mandatory disclosure regulation intended to reduce the risks that franchisees are exposed to, by guaranteeing that key information relating to the franchise operation is disclosed to the prospective franchisee prior to the signing of the franchise contract. (IMCO 2016: 14. Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, supra note 11 at 14)  As of 2016, the EU is under-performing with franchising only being 1.89% of GDP in the EU, but it is 5.95% in the United States (EP Motion for a European Parliament Resolution on the functioning of franchising in the retail sector 2016/2244 (INI): para. C). supra note 7 at para E.  Other key inhibitors are the differences in the national treatment of unfair trading practices by the various Member States. Para 2) with much of the franchise legislation introduced on a national level protects the interests of prospective franchisees by focusing on the pre-contractual disclosure by the franchisor, without the enactment of enforcement provisions ensuring the continuation of the franchise relationship, . Para 5) , E) , para. E.  at 6, 21. leaves room for potential abuse and opportunistic behaviour by enterprising franchisors. These gaps encourage opportunistic franchisors to engage in regulatory arbitrage in a bid to monopolise jurisdictions that offer relatively little to no regulation. Enterprising franchisors may be tempted to engage in a type of forum shopping in order to find jurisdictions with little to no protection, creating a type of ‘post-code lottery’. Fifthly, this lack of protection, coupled with the sizeable and ongoing investment involved, is likely to encourages prospective investors may decide to create their own businesses, rather than taking the costly and risky step of investing in a franchise. When investing in a franchise, the prospective franchisee is obliged not only to pay an advance to the franchisor, she is also obliged to make ongoing financial contributions to the franchisor -including royalty payments and advertising fees - and to purchase goods and equipment off the franchisor and their approved suppliers. Accordingly, rather than investing the advance in the franchise, a reluctant investor may decide to invest the funds in establishing her own business, especially when one bears in mind the fact that the average investment for franchisees is nearly double that for independent businesses.Sixthly, the lack of a disclosure regime during the negotiation of the contract, or the lack of a regime that stipulates the infrastructure and parameters of such disclosure, is likely to lead to misunderstanding and disagreements between the parties later on and may ultimately result in litigation and termination. Pre-contractual disclosure is likely to be beneficial to both parties by helping reconcile the expectations of the parties from the relationship. By providing the prospective investor with a comprehensive idea of her obligations as a franchisee, and the franchisor’s commitments, there is likely to be an alignment of expectations between the parties, reducing the scope for friction and litigation. Such an exchange of information is likely to result in a sustainable relationship, benefiting both parties.  Part three – Value of introducing an international regime governing mandatory disclosure  The average capital investment for franchisees is 110,000 USD. (Knight 1984: 57) This figure corresponds with figures in later research by Tuunanen & Hyrsky, which notes that In 60% of cases, the initial franchise fee is £8990 (GBP) or less and the average fee is £5850 (Tuunanen & Hyrsky 2001: 53-4)   The average royalty fee is 4.8% of sales for franchisees and the average advertising fee is 2.2% of sales for franchisees. (Knight 1984: 57) The royalty rate (as a percentage of sales) varies between none to over 9%. (Knight 1986: 9-10)  The average capital investment for franchisees is nearly double that for independent businesses, suggests Knight, with franchisees investing 110,000 USD compared to 57,000 USD which is the average investment made by independents. (Knight 1984: 57) In 60% of cases, the initial franchise fee is £8990 (GBP) or less and the average fee is £5850 (Tuunanen & Hyrsky 2001: 53-4)  ‘Markets work best when buyers are informed, disclosures inform them.’ The provision of information during the pre-contractual phase serves several goals, addressing the private interests of would-be franchisees, whilst also preserving and advancing wider market interestsAlso, such measures offer a win-win solution by balancing the often-competing needs of would-be franchisees and franchisors.  Mandatory disclosure resonates with the free market and autonomy principles; guaranteeing the freedom of would-be franchisees and franchisors to make decisions, preserving their freedom to choose, buy and contract. By securing the provision of pertinent, accurate and current information to the prior, whilst at the same time preserving the needs of the latter by helping preserve their ability to innovate, advertise and conclude deals which respond to market demands, without controlling the substance of the agreement itself which may curtail the franchisor’s ability to compete effectively on the marketplace.Protection of would-be franchisees Protection of would-be franchisees negotiating with out-of-state franchisors is achieved in a number of ways.Firstly, by obliging franchisors to provide pertinent, comprehensive, accurate and up to date information, such a regime aims to provide the would-be franchisee with the means to make a rational purchasing decision. To this end, information-based measures provide her with the opportunity and means to shop around, enabling her to compare the different offers available in the marketplace, as well as the contract terms proposed by each prospective franchisor, before extending her the time needed to go away and decide whether to buy a franchise, from whom and on what terms. Secondly, the provision of such information arguably elevates the would-be franchisee so that she is on par with the franchisor. One of the key aims of regulatory harmonization in the EU context is the desire to boost the confidence of the weaker contracting party, by guaranteeing her a uniform procedural and substantive infrastructure during the  Ben-Shahar 2014: 5.  Ben-Shahar 2014: 5; Howells 2005: 350  A full review of the value of mandatory disclosure can be found in Emerson and Meiselles 2021.  Howells 2018: 99; Purnhagen et al 2018: 158; Busch 2016: 221; Ben-Shahar 2014: 4-5; Weatherhill 2013: 93. C.f. Information facilitates rational wealth-maximising decision-making in turn facilitating the functioning of markets. (Grundmann 2002: 279; Busch 2016: 226)  Ben-Shahar 2014: 5; Busch 2016 : 223; Haupt 2003: 1139; Helberger 2011: 337, 345; Howells 2018: 97; Seizov 2017: 149. bargaining phase. Mandatory disclosure and the right of withdrawal are the main regulatory strategies used by the EUin this context. The right of withdrawal permits the weaker contracting party to exit the contract post formation, whilst mandatory disclosure obliges the stronger of the contracting parties to provide the weaker party with mandated information about the proposed deal no later than a stipulated number of days before the deal is concluded. Such information must be provided using a standardized form which highlights key fields of information thus ensuring easier comparison of such data. This procedure enables the disclosee to consider and compare the offer and the proposed terms with others on the marketplace. In addition, providing her with the means to seek professional advice. By way of analogue, the introduction of a harmonized body of regulation governing cross-border franchise deals will ensure that would-be franchisees have access to a defined and structured disclosure within a set period of time before the deal is concluded, in spite of the fact that the would-be franchisee’s place of business is in a state different to the state where the franchisor is operating.  Protection of would-be franchisors The protection of would-be franchisors negotiating with an out-of-state franchisee is achieved in a number of ways. Firstly, by regulating technical barriers and reducing market entry barriers, the costs of engaging in cross-border franchising are reduced, decreasing the overheads borne by those franchisors seeking international franchisees. By harmonizing the procedure and substance during the pre-contractual phase, predictability and transactional security are ensured. Secondly, in contrast with substance-based measures, information-based measures are viewed as a far more effective way of preserving the autonomy of parties to contract. Rather than regulation targeting economic behavior and controlling the substance of the contract, prices, advertising, the availability and infrastructure of franchises, mandatory disclosure offers an effective regulatory regime defining the time, place and manner of disclosure in a way that is far less onerous, clumsy and costly than the alternative.Market-based justifications  Purnhagen et al 2018: 158; Busch 2016: 221; Ben-Shahar 2014: 4-5; Weatherhill 2013: 93; Lusak 2021 : 243.  Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7.  Easterbrook 1984: 680, 685. See also Howells 2018: 97; Busch 2016: 222; Ben-Shahar 2014: 5. Beyond the benefits associated with having one ‘common’ code of rules – accessibility, clarity, the grouping together of different branches of law linked by common concepts, the ability to spot weaknesses in existing law enabling modernisation and a saving of the time, effort and money previously spent in ascertaining the state of the law, advising on I and complying with it – harmonisation of the rules of the various jurisdictions greatly facilitates interstate trade without which the burden of conducting business internationally would be intolerable.Mandatory disclosure preserves and advances public interests in a number of ways.  Firstly, such a regime goes a long way towards ensuring a variety of franchises are available on the marketplace, rather than reducing variety to either one possibility or a limited range of possibilities. Effectively, protecting the stream of franchises entering the market thus guaranteeing choice and bolstering effective competition. Franchising provides independent traders with the means to compete more effectively with large distribution undertakings, as the franchise set-up allows such traders to establish their outlets more rapidly and to operate with relative ease due to the infrastructure and support offered by the franchisor. Franchises also allow consumers and other end users a fair share of the benefit resulting from the association, providing them with access to a uniform network run by individuals who are personally invested in the operation of the outlet and personally interested in its efficient operation. The homogeneity of the network and the ongoing cooperation between the parties ensures a constant flow of products and services boosting interbrand and intrabrand competition.Secondly, by allowing would-be franchisees to protect themselves in line with their own individual choices, information-based remedies resolve the problem for a regulator of having to undermine the diverse preferences by imposing a common standard. By balancing the often competing interests of franchisors and would-be franchisees, mandatory disclosure is seen as a desirable cost reduction strategy by means of which society can underwrite the costs associated with searching for relevant information; mandatory disclosure helps ensure not only a larger quantity of information, but a better testing of its accuracy, improving allocative efficiency and  Goode 1988 : 137-8.  Grundmann 2002: 280; Nicolini 2006: 80.  This is the case with food labelling law which aims to ensure disclosure of all key ingredients in the food, allowing consumers to make informed decisions about the food they purchase and consume.  Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7; UNIDROIT Guide 2007: Ch 5, 11; Meiselles and Wharton 2018: 249-250.   Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7.   Regulation 4087/88, Preamble, para 7.   Haupt 2003: 1140 ; Busch 2016: 222. implying a more productive economy by steering would-be franchisees to make better decisions. In a similar vein, Coffee asserts that greater inefficiency would exist without mandatory disclosure due to the excess public costs associated with searching and collating information, adding that ‘collectivization helps minimize the social waste that would otherwise result from the misallocation of economic resources to this pursuit.’ Informed would-be franchisees are not only better able to protect their own interests by making decisions that are autonomous and well-informed; they are also able to boost competition and to make socially responsible choices thus serving the general interest alongside their own. By providing would-be franchisees with information about the key features of a franchise, they are able to make fair and advantageous bargains, encouraging price and quality competition on the part of franchisors. At the same time, the rules on information ensure an interaction between offer and demand, promoting and facilitating functioning competition, whilst ensuring a choice for would-be franchisees reflecting their needs and interests. Beyond its ability to enhance competition in the marketplace, a mandatory disclosure regime arguably helps steer users towards purchasing choices which are more advantageous to them, this is achieved by providing would-be franchisees with information about the benefits of the franchise (the support and training offered by the franchisor) and its risks (the initial and ongoing costs).Information-based measures address information asymmetry without distorting markets; guarding against market failure whilst also removing barriers to market entry and introducing commercial know-how into countries - notably those with developing economies and with economies in transition. International franchising plays a key role in guaranteeing fruitful transfer of know-how and technology which may be bilateral as well as unilateral, benefiting both parties as well as their respective economies. Enhancing levels of inward investment, generating economic growth, creating jobs, enhancing infrastructures, and generating tax revenues. This strategy has the added benefit of indirectly raising standards on the marketplace and promoting transparency and honesty in the way that the contract is made and executed. Also, in contrast with measures that regulate market behavior, information-based  Lusak 2021: 243.  Coffee 1984: 722; Lusak 2021: 243.  Helberger 2011: 337, 343.  Helberger 2011: 342.

Howells 2018: 99-100. measures protect the ability of commerce to innovate and compete by allowing commerce to develop products that offer attractive features, as franchisors compete with each other to attract would-be franchisees. Disclosures protect buyers who ‘fear sellers’ rapacity and the perils of caveat emptor’ without distorting markets by setting prices, quality and terms.While earlier analysis regards informational asymmetry as a brute inequality in the information available to buyers and sellers, restoring the balance and eliminating the bargaining disadvantage, modern theory acknowledges the subtle and complex ways in which information affects market dynamics, recognizing the cost implications of this regime. A number of benefits are associated with the introduction of a mandatory disclosure regime. Such a regime not only helps address a number of concerns associated with the current regulatory structure - key amongst them regulatory disparity and the ensuing regulatory gap – it also helps streamline commerce by offering a consistent and unvarying framework applicable to identical transactions. Accordingly, ensuring substantive and procedural uniformity, whilst guaranteeing higher levels of transparency and transactional certainty, and helping lower transactional costs. Such a programme would go a long way towards encouraging higher levels of contracting as franchisors and franchisees are aware of their rights and obligations.  Howells 2005: 350, 355-6.  Ben-Shahar 2014/5.  Hadfield et al 1998: 141. Part four – Stepping up? Is this the type of project the UNCITRAL should be looking at? How can the UNCITRAL achieve this aim? Currently, the process of pre-contractual disclosure is addressed by disparate bodies of national law and non-legislative instruments, which means that often in cross-border negotiations of franchises there is no guarantee that prospective franchisees have access to key information needed in order to make an informed decision about the merits and risks of investing in the franchise. This lack of legal harmonization amongst the different jurisdictions is exacerbated by the absence of an international regime governing mandatory disclosure of information to would-be franchisees before the franchise agreement is concluded, meaning that enterprising franchisors may seek out jurisdictions with little to no protective regulation, engaging in sharp practices, whilst prospective franchisees have no means of securing key information and legal redress. The value of introducing an international regime is multifaceted. Benefiting the parties themselves, whilst also furthering public interests. In this final segment of my paper, I will look at whether the UNCITRAL can help formulate an information-based regulatory framework that helps protect the interests of prospective franchisees by optimising their investment decision-making process and the interests of the wider market by helping enhance cross-trade in franchises, before considering the ways in which this can be achieved.  The move to formulate a single body of ‘common’ law at an international level and in turn harmonise the rules of the different nations is almost as old as the modern idea of codifying law. Systems of non-state rules have co-existed for centuries with state laws in the field of cross-border relations, in some cases pre-dating these. As the different European nations were developing their respective codes, there was a recognition of the need for the development of a body of ‘common’ law amongst the nations, due to the ‘community of commercial relations’ between these nations. Bolstered by three distinct policy objectives supportive of an international system: an economic drive to facilitate international commerce, a political goal of increasing interstate cooperation and order, and a moral aim of avoiding parochialism and  Bonell 1978: 413.  Wai 2002: 215. Wai adds that legal historians have shown how the system of state law is a late arrival in this context; many types of business relations remain governed by non-legal rules such as custom and trade and by non-legal enforcement mechanism such as retention of security, and reputational damage. (Wai 2002: 215-6)  Bonell 1978: 413. promoting non-discrimination, the vision of such an international order, rooted in the traditions of international liberalism, promotes the development of rules, institutions and norms intended to convince individual nations to forfeit policies geared to short-term self-interest in a bid to achieve potential long-term cooperative benefits.Whilst this campaign was delayed during the world wars, after world war two there was a renewed interest in such projects. A number of efforts towards unification or at the very least harmonization of the laws of the various nations took place during this period, though these efforts focused on specific topics, such as the sale of goods, trade terms, agency, arbitration.Alongside the work of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), which has been instrumental in creating a non-legislative framework to govern franchise agreements, the United Nations – under the auspices of the UNCITRAL - has been at the vanguard of the campaign to formulate regimes governing key commercial transactions.Established by the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) in 1966, UNCITRAL is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly of the UN entrusted with the role of facilitating international trade and investment through a process of progressive harmonisation and unification of the law governing cross-border commerce. Acknowledging the fact that divergencies amongst the laws of different nations in matters relating to cross-border commerce are one of the key impediments to the development of world trade and ‘the flow of international trade’ and recognising the need for a coordinated approach coupled with broader participation, the UNCITRAL has formulated legislative and non-legislative texts governing many aspects of commercial law, amongst them the law governing the sale of goods which addresses the bargaining phase and controls the substance of the contract (subject to the right  Wai 2002: 224.  Attempts to realise this project failed when the Projet de code des obligations et des contrats drafted by a group of leading Italian and French lawyers and intended as a first step towards the formulation of a new jus commune of Europe, was dismissed by the Italian and French Governments. This draft included 739 articles subdivided into 20 sections addressing the law of obligations in general and specific contracts in detail including agency, employment, loans and sales.

Originally composed of 29 members, membership was expanded in 1973 (to 36 States) and in 2004 (to 60 States).

(Article 1, Resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966) The five regional groups represented within the Commission are African States, Asian States, Eastern European States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States - UNCITRAL website https://uncitral.un.org/en/about/faq/mandate_composition/history (accessed 16/6/2020)   UNCITRAL’s work is performed at three different levels.

At the second level are the Working Groups which undertake a large portion of the developmental work, working on the topics on the UNCITRAL’s work programme. (para 10, Factsheet) At the third level is the secretariat which supports the Commission and Working Groups. (para 10, Factsheet) At the Commission’s sessions, the Commission is tasked with finalising and adopting the draft texts referred to it by the working groups, for reviewing the working groups’ progress reports, for setting topics for future work or further research.

The bureau of the Commission which is elected at the start of each annual session by the member States and serves until the start of the next annual session, represents each of the 5 regions from which the members of the Commission are drawn. (para 10, Factsheet and Official Records of the General Assembly, Twenty-third Session, Supplement No. 16 (A/7216) (1968), para. 14.) Conclusion Since the 1930s, firms have been using franchising as their preferred business model for expansion, first domestically and then internationally. The importance of cross-border franchises in the growth of international markets is acknowledged by the European Parliament, which also recognized the significance of harmonisation in this growth.The regulatory gap, resulting from a lack of an international regime governing mandatory disclosure during the bargaining phase, and the regulatory disparity, resulting from the disparities in the regulation available in different jurisdictions, is exacerbated by a number of other factors. Namely the concern of national regulators with domestic interests (rather than protecting interests abroad) and the lack of agreement amongst nations about standards and obligations, and the mechanisms for the effective enforcement of international rules.Enterprising franchisors and other international business actors are often adept at seeking out jurisdictions with little to no protective regulation. Effectively leaving weaker parties, such as would-be franchisees exposed. By engaging in, what Robert Wai calls, lift-off, such actors effectively remove the international business transaction from national regulatory oversight whilst freeing it from the regulation of domestic private law.Whilst contract law is often considered to the be the key to international transactions, capturing the ideal of promoting mutual promises in order to facilitate mutually beneficial transactions, regulation is often also motivated by considerations as to fairness between the parties; imposing limits on private ordering to ensure that basic conditions of voluntariness and adequate information are fulfilled. The motives for such regulation are varied, and encompass concerns about informational asymmetry, redressing the imbalance of power, paternalism and distributive fairness. Such regulation - governs the content of the contract – by imposing compulsory terms (governing for example jurisdiction and choice of law) and limiting the enforceability of exclusion clauses – as well as the pre-contractual phase. These protective measures are particularly poignant in the cross-border context, where as a result of lack of information, expertise and/or advice, many parties especially consumers or similar parties in a  EP Motion, para. 4.  Wai 2002 : 252.  Wai 2002: 212, 215.  Wai 2002: 237.  Wai 2002: 237.  Wai 2002: 237.. weaker position may not fully understand the full impact of clauses governing choice of law, choice of forum and arbitration clauses, when they appear in the a contract.To guarantee harmonization of the measures protecting would-be franchisees in international sales of franchises, I suggest UNCITRAL develop a body of regulation governing such sales.Inspired by the mandatory statutes used in the US, Canada, Australia and France and the model law developed by UNIDROIT - Model Franchise Disclosure Law (2002), such a regime should address the substance and procedure associated with pre-contractual disclosure. Firstly, the regime should oblige franchisors to provide would-be franchisees with a standard information pack in line with a defined procedural framework. Without information, choice becomes a torment. 95  Such information helps mitigate the sense of mental paralysis experienced or the tyranny of choice that is said to emerge from the sense of alienation and ineptness associated with choosing. 96 The imposition of a standard format and time of disclosure, thus goes a long way towards facilitating the comparative use of the information disclosed, helping create ‘an efficient disclosure language’.97 Accordingly, the UNCITRAL should give consider development of a standard information pack, facilitating such a comparative use of the information. Consisting of a standardised template document with defined fields of information - designed by the UNCITRAL for use in such transactions – and requiring the disclosure of supporting documentation by the franchisor audited accounts and predicted earnings for the outlet, alongside the draft franchise agreement and other key contracts. Such a pack should be accompanied by a statement of truth and should include the details of past and present franchisees, providing the would-be franchisee with the means to source references and to seek advice. Modelled on the Franchise Disclosure Document used in  Wai 2002: 237-8. This concern is recognized in international texts. The preliminary draft of the Hague Conference convention on jurisdiction and recognition of judgements illustrates this concern by excluding consumer and employment contracts from the general provision supporting forum-selection clauses. (Article 8, The Preliminary Draft Convention on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters was adopted by the Special Commission of the Hague Conference on October 30, 1999. Available at http://www.hcch.net/e/conventions/draft36e.html) Similarly, protective measures have been included in the Brussel Regulation (Recast) and Rome I which exclude consumers, employees and policy-holders from the general provisions that support forum selection and choice of law clauses (respectively).  Such a regime would govern the sale of franchises by a franchisor whose place of business is in a state different to that of the prospective franchisee, thus ensuring its applicability to cross-border transactions rather than domestic ones.   Hilton, Consumerism in 20-century Britain (2003), 268.  Hilton, Consumerism in 20-century Britain (2003), 268.  For this reason, a disclosure policy should also ban disclosure written disclosure of other information or oral variances, in order to root out novel methods of disclosure; such novelty may erode the utility of the disclosures in comparison, since ‘a firm could deny to investors in other firms the reciprocal advantages of disclosure by choosing to disclose things that were sufficiently unusual that the ordinary standards of comparison could not be employed.’ (Easterbrook 1984: 703) In securities regulation, for example, the standardisation of disclosure is achieved using the schedules which must be completed by each firm at defined times (Easterbrook 1984: 700-1). the United States, such a disclosure document would provide prospective franchisees with information about the obligations of the franchisor and its business credentials, the obligations and likely costs that a franchisee will incur alongside material information pertaining to the franchise itself, including details of the competitive nature of the market where the franchisee will be operating. Ultimately, such a disclosure would permit the prospective franchisee to make an informed decision about whether or not to enter into the franchise arrangement proposed, by enabling her to weigh-up the potential risks and benefits, so she is able to make a meaningful comparison with other investments.Secondly, the UNCITRAL should consider introducing of a procedural framework to accompany this disclosure obligation, with clear steps and stipulated deadlines. Amongst these, there should be an obligation on franchisors to furnish prospective franchisees with the information pack within a set period of time before execution of any binding franchise or the payment of consideration to the franchisor (whichever takes place first). By providing disclosure in advance of the date set for signing the agreement, prospective franchisees not only have the option of consulting with accountants, bankers and past as well as current franchisees, they also have an opportunity to seek specialised professional and legal advice on the investment, so they can seek guidance on the commercial and strategic information provided in the disclosure document, the terms of proposed franchise agreement and the precise benefits and risks associated with this arrangement. What is more this period acts as a cooling-off period, akin to the statutory periods provided in the context of consumer credit regulation. Such a move helps guarantee a level-playing field for franchisors and would-be franchisees by bringing some certainty to investors (franchisees), whilst instituting a framework which is similar to those used in other jurisdictions where the franchisor is operating thus ensuring consistency and reduced costs from the franchisor’s point of view. EP Motion, para. 20; GAO Report, 6.  §31119, California Corp. Code.  Franchisees often consult with others before signing the franchise agreement, though franchisees do not consult as many external sources as the franchisors claimed to recommend before the signing of the franchise agreement. (Knight 1986: 10) The key sources of information franchisees note are lawyers, existing franchisees, accountants and bankers. (Knight 1986: 10) This finding corresponds with later research by Morrison (1996) and Guillox et al (2004) which shows that a majority of respondents consult with current franchisees (77% for franchisees of the same network and 43% for franchisees of another network). (Guillox et al 2004: 219)  An important factor contributing to the satisfaction of franchisees is the range and quality of advice from external sources. (Hing 1995: 19) Hing found significant positive correlations between franchisee satisfaction and the helpfulness of advice received from legal counsel, accountants, bank managers, business consultants and other franchisees in the same network. (Hing 1995: 19) He also found a significant positive correlation between franchisee satisfaction and the number of helpful external advisors consulted. (Hing 1995: 19) Hing accordingly suggests that consulting a range of helpful external advisors before buying the franchise appears ‘to promote accurate pre-purchase expectations, which then increase post-purchase franchisee satisfaction.’ (Hing 1995: 19)  https://www.retailcouncil.org/advocacy/finance/british-columbia-uniform-franchise-legislation/ (accessed 25/6/2020) The leading concerns for franchisors expanding overseas are franchise management and staffing, by providing full information about the merits and risks associated with the franchise, franchisors can ensure that franchisees recruited are properly informed, ensuring the long-term retention of qualified personnel and the sustainability of the franchise. Whilst at the same time, reducing the potential for conflict Staffing, compatibility of interests and expectations and good communication are all important factors in the success of a franchise operation, benefiting the contracting parties and by extension the economy as a whole, whilst boosting cross-border commerce and trade.A Systematic Review of Power and Control in Marketing Channels: The Case of the Automotive Industry Adiba Fattah Doctoral Candidate School of Business and Creative Industries University of the Sunshine Coast Sippy Downs, QLD, 4556 Australia Phone: 0411 834-701 Email: afattah@usc.edu.au(contact person) Prof. Lorelle Frazer Dean and Head School of Business and Creative Industries University of the Sunshine Coast Sippy Downs, QLD, 4556 Australia Email: lfrazer@usc.edu.auDr. Wayne Graham Senior Lecturer in Management Head of Campus, USC Caboolture School of Business and Creative Industries University of the Sunshine Coast Sippy Downs, QLD, 4556 Australia Email : wgraham@usc.edu.auInternational Society of Franchising 2021 Annual Conference A Systematic Review of Power and Control in Marketing Channels: The Case of the Automotive IndustryABSTRACT There is a growing political debate surrounding the fairness of the Australian Franchising Code of Conduct, particularly in preventing opportunistic behaviour within the Australian Automotive Industry (AAI). While the long battle for better regulations to protect new car dealers continues, the AAI is also witnessing major disruptions of its distribution model. In 2020, Holden abruptly left the Australian market and Honda along with Mercedes-Benz announced a switch to a new marketing channel-the agency model. In 2021, Renault has closed its Australian headquarters leaving its distribution in the hands of an independent distributor. All of which is calling for franchising scholars to pay closer attention to this important yet under-researched industry. To date, research has not yet offered a holistic perspective and industry-specific understanding of franchising based on social, contractual and institutional approaches altogether.  Based on a systematic literature review, we examine the dynamics of power and control in marketing channels, drawing on current evidence from franchising in the automotive industry worldwide. Subsequently, we highlight the importance of taking a three-dimensional approach (i.e. social, contractual, and institutional) when conducting empirical and industry-focused research in marketing channels. Moreover, we discuss franchising issues in the AAI and some of the aspects of the disruptive agency model recently adopted by Honda and Mercedes-Benz. Finally, we close with a reflection on the future of marketing channels in the automotive industry, promising an exciting research agenda in franchising and the yet under-researched agency model. Keywords: franchising; power and control; automotive industry; systematic review; regulationsINTRODUCTIONThe distribution channels of the automotive industry are witnessing a historical shift from franchising to an agency model in manycountries, including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden. The agency model consists of transitioning a dealer principal from a franchisee to an agent acting on behalf of the car manufacturer – the latter will be able to sell through any direct marketing channel (i.e. online sales) and through the agents, who will receive a percentage of the profit. In Australia, Honda and Mercedes-Benz are advancingthe move to an agency model in 2021 and 2022 respectively (Newton, 2020). This significant transformation has occurred as a reaction to the technological disruption from online retail, requiring the traditional dealership franchised model to offer more flexibility and accessibility to customers. This shift to an agency model in Australia is motivated partly by regulatory pressure, considerable decreases in profitability and a global trend for disintermediation (Inampudi et al., 2019).  A country that will not be witnessing this change is the United States of America (USA).State laws for many years in the U.S. have prohibited company-owned automotive distribution channels in favour of product-tradename franchising (Stolze, 2014).  Recently, however, after a successful win to challenge the law in a number of state courts and legislatures, Tesla have been exclusively allowed to own and operate its own dealerships some U.S. states, with some states posing strong limitation to the number of stores that Tesla can own and operate (Young et al., 2020).  Even with this development, all other automotive manufacturer selling in the U.S, with the exception of Tesla, must sell via franchisees throughout the country, therefore hindering a car manufacturer’s ability to switch to the agency model (Lafontaine & Morton, 2010). The AAI, however, does not benefit from this degree of protection. In Australia, the Franchising Code of Conduct (the Code) regulates the franchising sector for most industries, and, in recent years, this Code has been subject to large criticism by key players in the AAI, voicing concerns that the Code is not fit-for-purpose (DIIS, 2018; PJCCFS, 2019). For almost a century, franchising has been the most efficient and commonly used distribution model for the automotive industry worldwide. This model is administered via franchising contractual arrangements between car manufacturers (franchisors) and car dealers (franchisees) and is subject to legal frameworks that regulate the relationship between the two members. Today, about 30 countries have adopted specific state and federal laws to regulate franchising, including Australia, Canada, the USA, Spain and Italy (Milenkovic, 2010; UNIDROIT, 2013).  The automotive industry represents an important percentage of retail revenues in many countries and contributes to the economy by generating profits, establishing small businesses such as dealerships and creating a large number of jobs (Almohri et al., 2019; Beer, 2018). Since the winding up of car manufacturing operations in Australia, automotive industryrevenue is now heavily reliant on its domestic retail activities. The AAI is dominated by foreign manufacturers, using a typical franchising distribution system comprising dealers. The latter are running either single-brand dealerships, by trading exclusively with one car manufacturer, or multi-brand dealerships, by trading with more than one car manufacturer.  In Australia, the automotive industry is an important market with 53,104 businesses operating, providing 284,000 jobs – 20 per cent of which are working in dealerships – and generating A$13 billion to Australia’s economy (AADA, 2020; Yin Huey, 2020). However, recent issues governing the relationship between channel members keep arising, generating concerns in this industry. In fact, commercial arrangements in the AAI are causing a number of franchising issues governing the relationship between car manufacturers and their authorised dealers. Interestingly, relatively little is known about the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer networks in Australia (Clibborn et al., 2016; Parment, 2008). In a report investigating the automotive industry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC, 2017) shared that many challenges faced by dealers are a result of the use of power by car manufacturers. Furthermore, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (PJCCFS) raised concerns around these challenges, which led to an ongoing questioning of the suitability of the Code in protecting new car dealers from the apparent abuse of power and control of some car manufacturers (PJCCFS, 2019).  While this historical shift towards the agency model in the AAI is now occurring, there is little understanding of the relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer networks. Specifically, little is documented on how power and control manifest in the automotive industry and how it can affect the relationship between car dealers and their franchisors. There is also a limited understanding around the world about how laws designated to regulate franchising can affect the operational relationship between franchisors and franchisees in general or within a specific industry (Lafontaine & Morton, 2010; Spencer, 2010; Stolze, 2014).  This conceptual paper focuses on power and control in automotive franchising, drawing upon evidence in the broader marketing channels literature. A systematic search analysis is conducted to collect and review the available research on the subject. Following this, available information from the AAI and the issues related to power and control in this franchising distribution model is presented and compared with other countries such as Spain, Italy, Canada, the USA and Turkey. Finally, directions for future research in marketing channels is provided, including the franchising model administered in the automotive industry and its disruptor – the agency model. Research Background  A great deal of attention has been paid to the aspects of power and control prevalent in marketing channel relationships. The literature is rich with evidence regarding the dark side of intra-channel relationships in which the abuse of power and control are exerted by a ‘channel captain’ to maximise the potential of this distribution channel (Parment, 2008). Hunt and Nevin (1974) were the first to establish a conceptual framework for the study of power in marketing channels. In this sense, non-coercive sources of power refer to channel member A employing either reward, legitimate, referent and/or expert powers (French & Raven, 1959) to provide support and assistance to channel member B. The latter is cooperating and complying with the actions undertaken by channel member A, assuming a co-operative process is established. Coercive power exists when channels A and B are interdependently functioning, and channel member A retains the ability to punish channel member B (Hunt & Nevin, 1974). The phenomenon of power is clearly represented in the franchise system, a contractual mode in which franchisors are favoured with a power permitted by the franchise contract (Atwell & Buchan, 2014).  Understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the franchisor and franchisee is crucial for achieving positive outcomes for both parties. This has been a core focus of franchising scholarship. Certainly, there is a traditional power and control imbalance embedded in the franchising relationship which often leads to major issues between the franchisor and franchisee (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Frazer et al., 2007; Lafontaine & Shaw, 2005; Lusch, 1976; Maloni & Benton, 2000). In fact, this power and control imbalance in favour of the franchisor has become a generally accepted view. In this regard, Coughlan et al. (2006, p. 560) confirmed that “franchising is inherently asymmetric, with the franchisee being highly dependent on the franchisor”.  Since franchising relies on both positive economic and social interactions to succeed (El-Ansary, 1992; Stern & Reve, 1980), it involves a mutual interdependence to co-create value                                                              Throughout this research paper, channel member A refers to the franchisor.   Throughout this research paper, channel member B refers to the franchisee. with complex and individual needs expressed by both parties. While the franchisees manifest a constant desire for entrepreneurial independence, franchisors pursue a continuous control of the system to protect the uniformity of the brand (Kidwell et al., 2007). Such divergence in goals, along with actions displaying the franchisor’s abuse of power and control over franchisees, can trigger frustration for both channel members (El-Ansary, 1992; Stern & Reve, 1980). Consequently, issues between channel members are inevitable and, in some cases, neither pre-determined contract clauses nor mediation can repair them, leaving channel members facing possible legal action.  Given the potential for franchise contracts to work in favour of the franchisor and if franchising relationships are unbalanced (Hoy et al., 2017; Parment, 2008), it is often the role of the country’s regulators to mediate conflicts that arise from the unstable relationship between franchisors and their franchisees. Beyond being a popular form of economic organisation, franchising is also an instrument of the law. The main purpose of franchising regulation is to monitor the relationship between channel members under a franchise agreement (Lim & Frazer, 2002). In Australia, the Code is the only legal framework for franchising among all industries, with the exception of the petroleum industry (Spencer, 2010). Although the Code has been regulating the franchising sector since 1998 and has been subject to several reviews to improve it, complications between franchisors and franchisees persist. In fact, in Australia, 25 per cent of business format franchisors were involved in a dispute with their franchisees during 2016, with 7 per cent of these cases subject to litigation and 8 percent under investigation by the Fair Work Commission (Frazer et al., 2016). Thus, concerns regarding the suitability of the Code and the way it impacts the franchise relationship and industry’s performance as a whole, have raised the attention of both scholars and practitioners (Terry & Lernia, 2009).It is noticeable that researchers, when investigating the dynamics of power and control in the franchising relationship, often fail to identify which franchising model is being studied between the two most common ‘product and trade name’ and ‘business format’ franchising models (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Perrigot et al., 2019; Rosenbloom, 2013; Shaikh et al., 2018). This remains an important distinction to make since the difference between these types lies in the business system provided to the franchisees and therefore changes the nature of the relationship and the perceived power and control dynamics between both parties (Rosenbloom, 2013). While product and trade name franchising only authorises franchisees to resell the franchisor’s product/service, business format franchising grants the franchisee a business system, which includes the know-how to successfully conduct the business (Mendelsohn, 2005). Product and trade name franchising was the first distribution model to expand worldwide in the 20 century, with the arrival of the automotive industry. Yet, recent studies mostly focus on business format franchising, the commonly used model for most industries, such as clothing, fast food and hospitality, with limited studies conducted on the product and trade name franchising model – few of which have focused on the automotive industry and those that do focus mainly on the USA, Canada, and Europe (Aboyoun, 2016; Arruñada et al., 2001; Davey-Rafer, 1998; Ennew et al., 1993; Zanarone, 2008).  However, to our knowledge, no study to date has drawn a connection between the specific regulatory framework for franchising, its effect on the contractual agreement and consequently the influence both will have on franchising relationships within the automotive industry. To this end, a systematic review of marketing channel scholarship on power and control is conducted, focusing on the franchising model and drawing on evidence from the findings available on the automotive industry. This systematic literature review (SLR) offers scholars a timeline, tracing the evolution of the role and impact that power and control have on marketing channel relationships. Moreover, it identifies the need to delve deeply into the franchising triangle – legal, contractual and relational – with industry-specific research on franchising. Finally, this work provides a starting point for further research to enrich and progress the understanding of franchising relationships. METHODOLOGYUsing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, this study assembles key scientific contributions on the topic of power and control in the marketing channels and franchising scholarship. Initially adopted from the medical science discipline (Parris & Peachey, 2013), the SLR methodology is used to search, collect and select scientific contributions on a given topic by following a methodical and reliable process and offering greater research quality (Jahan et al., 2016). In fact, when compared to a traditional literature review, the search and selection stages of the SLR are based on objective inclusion criteria, hence decreasing the researcher’s bias and increasing the reliability and quality of the SLR.  Moreover, the SLR process is not only predominantly free of researcher bias but is also replicable given its transparent and thoroughly descriptive process (Dada, 2018; Tranfield et al., 2003; Weed, 2005). Such a methodology has already been used in marketing channels and franchising research (Dada, 2018; Mani et al., 2019; Nijmeijer et al., 2014). For this SLR, the authors followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to guide the methodological design. While PRISMA was initially developed for systematic reviews in health sciences, this checklist is also applicable to different disciplines and research foci, such as business and management (Easterby-Smith et al., 2018). Using PRISMA enables the researcher to achieve quality and transparency in terms of both the design and the reporting of the systematic review process (Tricco et al., 2018). Literature Search Process A systematic search of key databases was performed in May 2020. This paper focuses on the aspect of power and control in franchising, given that franchising is the dominant marketing channel used in the automotive industry worldwide. While the authors’ discussion is mainly drawn from the literature on the topic of power and control in the broader marketing channel literature, a particular focus during this systematic search is directed towards franchising scholarship. Hence, a preliminary search using the words ‘power and/or control’, ‘marketing channels’, and ‘franchising’ in ProQuest was conducted to determine a list of key terms that would best align with the research topic. The literature results were screened, and the authors concluded that since this initial search query was yielding a large set of available literature on the topic, the list of keywords would need to be expanded but limited to the use of Boolean operators only. This search strategy is deemed to sufficiently cover the research subject (Nijmeijer et al., 2014; Tranfield et al., 2003). Accordingly, the entry (power AND/OR control) remained unchanged, and the keywords (“marketing channel” OR “distribution channel”) and (franchising OR franchise) were used to collect the available literature on the research topic. The ProQuest systematic search was scripted as (franchise AND (control OR power)) AND (franchising AND (control OR power)) AND (“marketing channel” AND (control AND power)) AND (“marketing channels” AND (control AND power)) AND (“distribution channel” AND (control and power)) AND (“distribution channels” AND (control and power)) AND (franchising AND (control and power)) AND (franchise AND (control and power)). The above search queries were run in ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science databases, with only minor adjustments to the entry query due to the databases’ different coding systems. No publication date was delimited during this search query, and the results for each database were exported to a formatted Excel file with a total of 638 references. Following the removal of duplicates, the database was reduced to 408 references.  Selection Process To reduce the number of errors and the risk of bias,the study selection was conducted in a systematic manner based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria sheet. The latter was established prior to the systematic literature database search. Both the inclusion and exclusion criteria sheet and the study selection were reviewed and approved by two academic experts in the field. This process contributed to limiting the search, duplication, exclusion, inclusion and selection bias,therefore contributing to the quality of the systematic search and the selection outcome (Jahan et al., 2016). Table 1 outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria with specific examples of studies found within the database search results. Table 1. List of inclusion and exclusion criteria After the identification process was completed, two cross-checks of the literature were conducted. The first was a reference cross-check of a sample of the identified articles which were selected based on the most recent publication dates. The second cross-check was with a database within the reference manager software Zotero. This database of references contained literature on the same research topic and was managed by one of the researchers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to this database prior to cross-checking. The outcome of these cross-checks contributed to adding 17 more articles to screen for further eligibility. Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flow diagram from the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies. It illustrates the reporting of the literature selected for the SLR. Figure 1. The PRISMA flow diagramThe selection process was initially conducted following a comprehensive understanding of the articles’ titles and abstracts, along with a screening of journal publications. When this was not conclusive, the full text of the article was read to confirm the inclusion or exclusion decision. Papers which focused on other inter-organisational arrangements and unrelated topics within the marketing channel scope were discarded.  Selected Literature The final outcome of this search strategy resulted in 31 journal articles on power and control from the marketing channel or franchising literature. Table 2 shows that a majority of the studies were on franchising (=19) with the remaining focusing on other forms of marketing channels. Moreover, 22 studies involve empirical research methodologies: eight using qualitative methods, 13 studies involving quantitative methods, and one study based on mixed methods. The majority of studies focus on power only (=12). A further 11 studies focus on both power and control, and eight studies discuss the concept of control only. Furthermore, out of the 31 studies, only four focus on the automotive industry, with the most recent published in 2008, while the other two remaining articles were published in 1976, 1986, and 1993 respectively. A preliminary synthesis of the articles selected from the systematic search is conducted, focusing on findings related to power and control in marketing channels and franchising. The 31 articles are classified based on the industry focus- retail and food are the most dominant industries and an important gap on power and control in automotive-industry-specific research can be observed. Details of the 31 articles including key findings is available on request. DATA ANALYSIS Marketing channels as a research field strongly interacts with diverse intellectual disciplines such as management, economics, finance and law. Franchising specifically has a high degree of interaction with these disciplines as researchers often use this distribution model to contextualise their studies and empirically test their research questions (Barthélemy, 2011; Combs et al., 2009; Gabrielsen & Roth, 2009; Michael, 2000). In such instances, researchers use a qualitative content analysis in the systematic review of academic studies (Cetindamar et al., 2009; Tranfield et al., 2003). Similarly, this present study employs the content analysis technique to systematically review the scientific contributions on power and control in marketing channels.  The purpose of content analysis is to categorise the information from the selected literature in key themes along with sub-categories and quantify the instances when each key theme is linked to an individual sub-category (Dada, 2018; Silverman, 2013, p. 443).  For instance, a key theme in this research is the concept of ‘power’, the sub-categories for this key theme being ‘non-coercive power’, ‘coercive power’, ‘countervailing power’ and ‘legitimate power’. Another example is the key theme ‘control’, with the sub-categories of ‘control mechanism’ and ‘perceived control’. In some instances, sub-categories were also divided. For example, the sub-category ‘control mechanism’ was separated into ‘authoritative mechanism’ and ‘contractual mechanism’. Finally, the quantification of this categorisation was undertaken following the number of times the key themes were evoked, the key themes and individual sub-themes were discussed and, where relevant, the key themes, the sub-themes and the further categorisation in the sub-theme were analysed. The categorisation and quantification of the literature are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. Structure of codingThe coding process described above was undertaken using the qualitative analysis software CAQDAS NVivo 12 Plus. This software facilitated the formulation of the content analysis thematic by providing quantification of recurrent topics, which formed the codes, creating links between the codes and the article in the database. This process contributed to forming a preliminary list of sub-themes and, finally, narrowing down the analysis to research streams predominantly occurring in the topic of power and control in marketing channels. RESULTS A significant portion of the literature on power in marketing channels focuses on comparing the effect of coercive and non-coercive sources of power when exerted by a channel member on the overall channel relationship, including satisfaction, performance and the commitment of channel members (Benton & Maloni, 2005; Frazer et al., 2007; Lusch, 1976). A dominant research stream on control in marketing channels focuses on two main sources of control – outcome and behaviour control (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Lafontaine & Shaw, 2005; Mellewigt et al., 2011) – with an emphasis on the relationship between perceived control and power (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Dant, 2008; Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Perrigot et al., 2019). In this section, the concepts of power and control in marketing channels will be reviewed, with a particular focus on examining these concepts in vertically integrated channels (i.e. franchising), drawing on some examples from the automotive industry worldwide.  Power in Marketing Channels Empirical and conceptual research has contributed to a great understanding of the inherent presence of power in channel relationships (Frazer et al., 2007; Hingley, 2005b; Maloni & Benton, 2000; Sheu & Hu, 2009b). Hunt and Nevin (1974) developed a conceptual framework for the sources of power in channel distribution. The sources of power accessible by channel members consist of coercive and non-coercive (i.e. legitimate, expert, reward and referent) sources of power. Both sources of power were empirically tested within a vertically integrated channel (i.e. franchising) in the context of the food industry in the USA. Hunt and Nevin (1974) concluded that the franchisor held predominantly coercive sources of power, with its use negatively correlated with the satisfaction levels of franchisees operating within the franchise system.  This finding was reiterated in the context of the US automotive industry. In fact, Lush (1976) found that coercive sources of power not only decreases satisfaction for new car dealers in the distribution system but also contributes to conflict, as the car manufacturer who possesses and exerts this source of power retains the ability to punish the new car dealers. Conversely, non-coercive sources of power provide support and assistance and therefore contribute to an increase in satisfaction levels for new car dealers. When referring to non-coercive sources of power and their benefit to channel relationships, legitimate power is one that surfaces often.  In the context of franchising, Frazer et al. (2007) found that when the franchisee realises and accepts the legitimate power held by the franchisor, the relationship has a better chance of succeeding. In fact, Sheu and Hu (2009b) reinforce the same statement based on their findings that legitimate power positively correlates with the commitment between channel members to succeed collectively. More recently, Shaikh et al. (2018) concluded that legitimate power contributes to creating perceived fairness in franchising relationships, an essential value to a productive partnership in marketing channels.  An early empirical study demonstrated a relationship between sources of power and performance within a channel system. Sibley and Michie (1981) found that non-coercive sources of power exerted by channel member A contributed positively to the perceived performance of channel member B. The latter conceives such use of power, specifically expert sources of power, as a form of support. However, the use of power alone is not sufficient to achieve a higher level of performance. In this sense, Sheu and Hu (2009b) discovered that if channel member A needs resources from channel member B, a collaboration of both parties will be primordial, regardless of whether channel member A has power in their favour. Similarly, Ranfagni and Guercini (2014), in their case study, conclude that when mutual benefit exists, the collaboration, commitment, and communication (3Cs) is a favourable mechanism to adopt. In effect, the 3Cs not only takes over sources of power but also contributes to decreasing conflict between channel members. Finally, the effect of power on levels of performance was also dismissed by other researchers. In fact, Shaikh et al. (2018) found that perceived fairness is the one relational aspect contributing to channel performance. This was particularly elaborated in the franchise channel, with Shaikh et al. (2018) finding that the use of coercive power by franchisors reduces franchisees’ perceptions of fairness, which then decreases the channel performance. Such findings have greatly contributed to academic knowledge by offering a greater understanding of power and its effect on satisfaction, conflict and performance in marketing channels.  However, Gaski (1984) detected conceptual and methodological issues related to some of the findings described above (Hunt & Nevin, 1974; Lusch, 1976; Sibley & Michie, 1981). His key point is that researchers did not differentiate clearly between the existence of sources of power and the application of these sources of power when investigating their effect on channel relationships (Gaski, 1984). The assumption that one does not equal the other needs to be acknowledged (Benton & Maloni, 2005; Frazer et al., 2007; Hunt & Nevin, 1974). Gaski (1984) also suggests that researchers should obtain a much deeper understanding of the sources of power when applied by a channel member. In any event, if channel member A exerts a coercive source of power to request channel member B to undertake costly staff training, channel member B may either abide by or deviate in some ways from the request; both options depend on the levels of countervailing power that channel member B possesses.  In the last two decades, countervailing power disappeared from the empirical and conceptual research in marketing channels, leaving the attention limited to coercive and non-coercive sources of power. However, interesting work was conducted by Ketilson (1991) and Mallen (1978) on the role of countervailing power in marketing channels. Ketilson (1991) describes countervailing power as a mix between legitimate power and legal power. In fact, in a retailing–wholesaling system, countervailing power enables both retailers and wholesalers to maintain harmony in their marketing channel by managing conflict at different levels of the channel. Such a finding is unique to the retailing–wholesaling system where small and large businesses co-operate with a high level of control, where they are required to maintain similar standards for both retailers and wholesalers (Ketilson, 1991).  A different yet equally important perspective was offered by Mallen (1978). He considers the marketing channel as an institutional system with societal issues, which result from the presence and application of channel power. Mallen believes that in any institutional system, countervailing power plays the role of a regulatory framework and adjusts the impact of those societal issues. Mallen (1978) particularly elaborated the institutional perspective in the context of franchising. He concluded that societal issues in the franchising institution could be reduced if the sources of power leading to information dissemination and unilateral contract termination were regulated through countervailing powerThe presence of any source of power may arise from different situations occurring within a marketing channel. Lederhaus (1984) was the first to explain that interdependence, an inherent part of channel relationships, traces the first form of power. In the same fashion of Mallen (1978), Lederhaus (1984) considers sources of power within the institutional system (i.e. marketing channels), where channel member A and channel member B work inter-dependently, occupy different functions and have common and distinct objectives. She suggests that in an institution where the number of channel members B is large, channel member A will possess less power than an institution in which the number of channel members B is reduced. Lederhaus’ (1984) conceptual paper is the first to discuss bargain power in marketing channels.  There is still debate about which power (i.e. coercive and non-coercive) is most beneficial to reduce the consequences of conflict and create a better control system in marketing channels. However, Frazier and Summers (1986) explain that within the franchise channel administered in the US automotive industry, car manufacturers tend to see positive results when they use coercive sources of power in a critical situation (i.e. economic crisis), and where the initial application of non-coercive sources of power did not lead new car dealers to respond accordingly. In fact, empirical results in this research found that the sources of power in franchising relationships within the automotive industry emanate from the dependence of new car dealers on that relationship; that is, a higher dependence of new car dealers results in higher sources of power for car manufacturers.  Similarly, Ennew et al. (1993) found that in the Turkish automotive industry, the franchise channel automatically gives power to car manufacturers through the formal contractual agreement and the commercial nature of the industry. In their study, they focus on the effect of sources of power on control, which will be further developed in the next section on control in marketing channels. Likewise, Doherty and Alexander (2006) emphasise the importance of consistency in using sources of power. They believe that in franchising relationships, if power is in favour of the franchisor, it is important to stay consistent by using either coercive or non-coercive sources of power and to ensure that coercive sources of power are not abandoned in addressing critical situations as they arise.  The relationship between power and dependence of channel members was also a subject of research for Hingley (2005a, 2005b). In his first attempt, Hingley conceptually explains why power asymmetry is not a threat to performance. Rather, he believes that power asymmetry can be profitable for both parties if self-interest is sought in a co-operative manner, therefore leading to a successful relationship. Hence, Hingley (2005a) encourages the tolerance of power in asymmetric channel relationships and questions the pre-established ingredients of a successful channel relationship (i.e. trust and mutuality) which are in their essence conditional due to the commercial nature of the channel relationship.  The above statements were further reinforced in Hingley’s (2005b) empirical testing, which showed positive outcomes in relation to the use of power when cooperativeness is prevalent in the relationship, whereas excessive use of power is destructive. Such findings are further supported in a number of studies (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Frazer et al., 2007). Furthermore, Quinn (1999) found that the use of power by a channel member is not the main source of conflict in channel relationships. Rather, channel members’ expectations, particularly the franchisees’ unmet expectations in terms of support received from their franchisors, is the main contributor to conflictFrom a franchisor’s perspective, at the beginning of the relationship, some offers of support to a franchisee have a lifecycle and this level of support will be reduced when the franchisee acquires the knowledge transfer and experience. Whether franchisees realise such support will be reduced (or in some cases terminated) when the relationship matures depends on the due diligence they conduct prior to entering the franchise agreement. (Weaven et al., 2010).  A co-dependant franchisee may perceive the decline of support as alarming and will therefore request more assistance from the franchisor. Alternatively, a franchisee with higher entrepreneurial needs may perceive an abundance of support as too controlling and thereby may welcome a decline in support from the franchisor. The next section aims to explain how control is perceived differently by franchisees and how its mechanisms evolved into variant forms and for different purposes. Control in Marketing Channels Control in marketing channels has been of great interest to academics who study channel relationships (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Ennew et al., 1993; Quinn, 1999). In fact, the way channel members perceive control has enabled researchers to detect the various control mechanisms exerted by the channel captain. Control over the distribution channel is a natural response from the channel captain looking to protect their distribution system. However, participants’ perceptions of control may affect their level of satisfaction with the distribution system (Frazer et al., 2007). This is of particular relevance in franchising as the franchisor may engage in controlling behaviours to ensure that the franchise network complies with the marketing plan and that the franchise system is delivering consistent levels of quality and value through different franchisees (Boulay, 2010).  In fact, similar to expert sources of power, a form of expert control was noted by Anand (1987) when he analysed the process by which franchisees evaluate their own performance. In his study, Anand (1987) found that franchisees attribute their performance based on the performance of their franchisor and accredit their success to the franchisor’s leadership. Such findings suggest that a franchisor with a successful franchise model holds a range of controls to exert, which could also be perceived positively by channel members (Anand, 1987). This finding was confirmed later in other empirical research conducted by Mohr et al. (1996) whoobserved that control used by the franchisor had a positive effect on the relationship. In this case, the franchisor possessed a high expert source of power in the industry and exerted control, which was positively perceived by the franchise network. However, in some instances, higher levels of control decreased the authority and autonomy of channel members who desired more freedom to exercise their commercial activities, which resulted in a decrease in satisfaction (Mohr et al., 1996). The result of this research posits an important reflection- Is the aftermath of control exercised by the franchisor is determined only based on the levels of dependence and cooperation of the franchisee, which may ultimately affect differently the satisfaction of the latter?  In the Canadian automotive industry, Levy Mangin et al. (2008) found that a car dealer with high level of dependence on a car manufacturer cooperates more than a car dealer with lower level of dependence. To increase dependence and cooperation, communication is deemed a critical attribute. This finding was challenged in another research on franchising leading to further importance given to nurturing dependence in a channel system (Frazer et al., 2007).  In fact, the more dependant the franchisee is on the franchise system, the more control the franchisor has, and the more support the franchisee expects from the franchisor (Frazer et al., 2007). While dependence may be seen as beneficial to a controlling channel member, it can also bring its troubled dynamics to the system- Particularly when less support is offered to a franchisee who has become too dependent on the franchisor’s support (Quinn, 1999; Sheu & Hu, 2009a). In this sense, transitioning from an initially highly dependent to a more interdependent franchising relationship can create dissatisfaction in franchisees, who may in some instances exit the franchise system (Frazer et al., 2007). These findings show that communication and dependence can become a double-edged sword if mishandled. In fact, while they can be a good combination to increase the franchisor’s control, careful consideration should be taken to ensure franchisee’s satisfaction (therefore commitment and performance) is still achieved. In the Turkish automotive industry, the commercial nature of this relationship, based on franchising, and the contractual clauses between car manufacturers and their dealers suggest that close control is demonstrated by the car manufacturer (Ennew et al., 1993). The outcome of the control dynamics in this franchise relationship suggests that dealers perceive control as detrimental when the car manufacturer uses coercive sources of power but as beneficial when control is exerted through non-coercive sources of power (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Ennew et al., 1993).  Franchising remains an interesting marketing channel to explore the concept of control. In a recent research article, different levels of control were observed within different forms of governance in franchising (i.e. master development franchising and joint venture franchising) with comparison to a wholly-owned marketing channel (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017). The levels of control tend to fluctuate depending on the levels of environmental uncertainty, and will, therefore, influence what distribution channel the franchisor will use to expand activities (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017). These environmental uncertainties include economic, institutional and behavioural factors.  Behavioural uncertainty raises agency issues unique to channel relationships. When expanding in heterogeneous host countries, franchisors are faced with differing degrees of work ethic, labour laws, professional qualifications and capacity of local staff. Therefore, a wholly-owned marketing channel is the least efficient distribution mode with consideration to the costs it incurs. Rather, joint venture franchising and master development franchising, which offer lower control over the channel, are the preferred mode for the franchisor (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017; Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011). Moreover, if institutional uncertainty is high and the franchise activities are based on product and trade name franchising rather than business format franchising, master development franchising is a less appropriate arrangement (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2017; Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011). Undoubtedly, current governmental investigation into the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and dealers create an important level of institutional uncertainty. However, it remains unclear whether some overseas car manufacturers are acting on it with the exit of Holden, the move to the agency model by Honda and Mercedes-Benz, and most recently Renault choosing to outsource its retail activities to a local distributor.  Control can either contribute or prevent opportunistic behaviour in marketing channel relationships (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Mellewigt et al., 2011). To understand this statement, it is important to look at the numerous control mechanisms exercised in marketing channels.  The first framework of control mechanism in the organisational system was developed by management scholars in the 1970s (Ouchi, 1979). This framework comprised three control mechanisms observed in an organisational setting: market mechanismsbureaucratic mechanisms and clan mechanisms. Invariably, these control mechanisms were introduced as tools utilised by the organisation for the management and supervision of employees and complex tasks within and between organisations (Ouchi, 1979). In 1995, Weitz and Jap were the first to borrow this management framework and apply it to marketing channels. Market, bureaucratic and clan mechanisms were renamed as authoritativecontractual and normative control mechanisms (Weitz & Jap, 1995). This set of control mechanisms is used by channel members – generally the channel captain – to harmonise or dictate the norms of their relationship with their distribution network. The differentiation between each type of control mechanism relies on the importance of ensuring adequate control mechanisms are employed for the appropriate distribution channel (Weitz & Jap, 1995). In essence, any control mechanism also requires the participation of one (unilateral) member or both (bilateral) members to be exercised within the marketing channel (Heide, 1994). Therefore, control takes multiple effects depending on who exercised it and whether the subject took part of it.   authoritative control mechanism is observed when the status of channel members gives them the power to control another channel member (Weitz & Jap, 1995). Authoritative control is applied through non-coercive sources of power. A channel member with less expertise in the market or resources to operate efficiently will be more dependent on the channel captain, giving the latter a range of opportunities to control the activities of the less experienced party (expert power) (Gaski, 1984; Weitz & Jap, 1995). The authoritative control mechanism is unilateral as control shifts in favour of one party only, while the weakest party must abide by the rules imposed on them. The unilateral nature of this control mechanism was partially supported in the Canadian automotive industry, as non-coercive sources of power exercised by car manufacturers appear to increase dealers’ cooperation (Lévy Mangin et al., 2008)- However, no link between the perception of authoritative control and cooperation is to be found.  normative control mechanism is an implicit principle, a lesson learnt through past experience with the channel captain, the nature of organisational culture adopted by the channel captain, their reputation or any other shared beliefs within the channel system (Weitz & Jap, 1995). All of these factors consequently alter the relational norms between the parties involved (Deshpande, & Webster, 1992; Weitz & Jap, 1995). To exemplify the normative control mechanism, consider the following hypothetical situation: a car dealer requires training and support for a technical repair of a vehicle. However, the car dealer knows that they cannot be straightforward in their request to receive more training and support from the car manufacturer. Instead, the car dealer needs to approach the request by showing how beneficial this support was when and if they received it in the past without asking for it. In fact, the dealer’s experience with the car manufacturer has shown this is the best strategy to communicate and receive positive outcomes from the car manufacturer regarding requests for more support. Because of the implicit nature of the normative control mechanism, the relationship dynamic in the channel system can become critical (Weitz & Jap, 1995). For instance, because of the company’s organisational culture, channel member A does not welcome the input of channel member B when it comes to strategic organisational plans. Hence, channel member B is expected to know and accept that they will not be consulted on the decision to adopt a new sales strategy, even though they are directly impacted by such a strategy. Because it is expected of channel member B to understand and accept these implicit principles, this form of control mechanism is bilateral. The normative control mechanism is by far the least researched form of control mechanism in marketing channels. This is possibly due to its tacit and case-by-case display in marketing channels (Deshpande, & Webster, 1992; Heide & John, 1992; Weitz & Jap, 1995). In marketing channels, control can become a legal right prescribed through the contractual agreement between channel members. This is particularly observed in the contractual channel structure, such as franchising. In effect, a franchise is a legal contractual agreement between the franchisor and its franchisees. In some cases, the country’s legal framework may stipulate the control ownership in the franchising relationship (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). In Australia, the Code instructs that a franchise agreement is an agreement in which: …a person (the franchisor) grants to another person (the franchisee) the right to carry on the business of offering, supplying or distributing goods or services in Australia under a system or marketing plan substantially determined, controlled or suggested by the franchisor or an associate of the franchisor… (Franchising Code of Conduct, 2014, Clause 5[1b], emphasis added).  contractual controlmechanism consists of utilising the written agreement between the channel members to incorporate clauses which aim to control one party and dictate specific actions the latter must undertake to fulfil their responsibilities towards the channel captain (Weitz & Jap, 1995). Unlike the authoritative control mechanism, the contractual control mechanism is an explicit and formal form of control found in the contractual terms giving the controlled party an opportunity to negotiate the control term or reward in exchange for abiding by the contractual terms (Marie et al., 2014).   Undoubtedly, in the automotive industry, a dealer’s efficiency and effectiveness are key factors for car manufacturers to gain and maintain leverage and compete in the market (Almohri et al., 2019). Two studies conducted in Italy and Spain provide evidence of car manufacturers engaging in contractual control to ensure the dealer’s activities are aligned with what the company wants to achieve (Aboyoun, 2016; Almohri et al., 2019)In this sense, dealer agreements were deemed imbalanced as information regarding the responsibilities of the dealer are exhaustively detailed, whereas the obligations of car manufacturers toward the dealer network seem to be only vaguely detailed, leaving the opportunity for the car manufacturer to unilaterally change its responsibilities towards its dealer network (Arruñada et al., 2001; Zanarone, 2008).  In franchising, any precautionary attempt to control the marketing channel network is defined as a feed-forward control mechanism (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Langfield-Smith, 1997). A feed-forward control mechanism is any action undertaken by the franchisor to minimise opportunism and free-riding of the franchisees by identifying possible flaws in the system (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). This control mechanism can be administered at any stage of the channel system – from the selection criteria, the interview process of the potential franchisee to the contractual agreement and operational manuals used to dictate the day-to-day activities of channel members (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). The feed-forward control mechanismmay contribute to building an efficient distribution channel system, but how do franchisors track the compliance of each channel member in their franchise network?  Concurrent control mechanisms come into play when there is a need to ensure the conformity of channel members with the distribution system established by the franchisor (Simons, 1990). Concurrent control mechanisms are expressed in the form of checkpoints to monitor a channel member’s progress (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Simons, 1990). For instance, a car manufacturer may send a dealer representative on a monthly basis to check-in with the dealer principal if they have indeed committed to getting the latest showroom upgrade. Moreover, although the franchise contract between a car manufacturer and a dealer stipulates the latter is responsible for training new staff members at their expense, concurrent control mechanisms can still be exercised (Arruñada et al., 2001). For instance, the car manufacturer may send a dealer representative to audit the servicing department of the car dealership and ensure newly recruited staff are compliant with the franchisor’s servicing and warranty processes.  In rare cases, channel members may retain a form of control mechanism to exercise over their channel captain. This may be peculiar to franchising in which efficient knowledge transfer and information asymmetry represent important assets for the prosperity of the distribution system (Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011; Windsperger & Dant, 2006). In effect, if a franchisee retains crucial data from the franchisor, such as idiosyncrasies on the consumer and the local market within which he operates, the franchisee can exercise feedback control mechanisms (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Otley & Berry, 1980) This form of control mechanism can be used when the franchising contract is nearing completion, through withholding or sharing at varying levels of accuracy the information the franchisee retains (Atwell & Buchan, 2014). To reduce this exercise of control, franchisors, operating locally, must implement their highest contractual control mechanisms to increase the commitment and information sharing of channel members (Luo et al., 2011). However, franchisors operating internationally may be institutionally constrained in their ability to exercise contractual control mechanismsTherefore, a preventive action to reduce the feedback control mechanism of franchisees is to adopt careful recruiting processes of franchisees and invest in building franchising relationships based on trust and communication (Doherty & Alexander, 2006). Much like coercive sources of power and non-coercive sources of power in marketing channels, behavioural control mechanisms and outcome control mechanisms exercised by a franchisor may affect the levels of satisfaction and performance of the franchisee differently.  outcome controlmechanism is when the franchisor offers incentives to the franchisee in order to increase their willingness to achieve specific targets (Mellewigt et al., 2011). Because of the non-constraining nature of this form of control mechanism, the franchisee does not feel obligated to achieve a goal set by the franchisor. Instead, the franchisee is motivated to excel in their activities and gain the incentive. Therefore, outcome control mechanisms contribute to increasing franchisees’ satisfaction and performance levels (Bergen et al., 1992; Mellewigt et al., 2011). The positive effect of the outcome control mechanism is unique to franchising and cannot be generalised. In fact, Mellewigt et al. (2011) found conflicting results when investigating the effect of outcome control mechanisms on the employee–manager relationship. In this study, satisfaction levels decreased (Mellewigt et al., 2011).  The behaviour control mechanism is an elaborated form of contractual control mechanism. While the latter consists of‘you must do the task’, the behaviour control mechanism is ‘this is how you must do the task’. This form of control mechanism restrains the autonomy of the channel member subject to it considerably (Luo et al., 2011; Mellewigt et al., 2011). While the channel captain dictates the behaviours expected to achieve a similar quality standard of delivery and prevent the free-riding of opportunistic channel members, those with highly entrepreneurial needs will fail to see the benefit and may experience frustration from having to adopt the dictated routines. Therefore, their satisfaction may decrease, along with their motivation to perform (Mellewigt et al., 2011).  A number of tools have been implemented in recent years to allow channel captains more control over their marketing channel system. In fact, information system (IS) tools have been widely used in franchising to allow franchisors a degree of control over their franchise system. In a highly competitive market, IS tools have enabled franchisors to monitor the commercial activities of franchisees and ensure the desired level of compliance is achieved (Boulay, 2010). IS tools may also contribute to minimising any control exercised by the franchisees. For instance, if the franchisor has access to important data through the implementation of IS tools throughout the channel structure, it is expected that the levels of the feedback control mechanism will decrease (Boulay, 2010).  Researchers have strongly encouraged nurturing relational norms rather than administering procedures to control channel members. To address issues related to the exercise of control in marketing channels, promoting collaborative communication towards shared values and aligned interests contributes to a better acceptance of the received control by the franchisees. In fact, collaborative communication seems to decrease the need for control and achieve higher performance creating a healthy and profitable distribution system. In some cases, the channel captain who invests in collaborative communication rather than control mechanisms notices an increase in satisfaction and coordination among their channel members (Doherty & Alexander, 2006; Mohr et al., 1996). There is certainly no perfect recipe to create a flawless yet profitable marketing channels, however implementing strong values rather than dictating procedures can effectively balance healthy and beneficial interaction between both channel parties. DISCUSSIONResearchers in the field of marketing channels have investigated sources of power and control in the franchise system and have shown that this vertically integrated system is conflictual by nature. In fact, research reveals that the main causes of franchising disputes are a result of control and power imbalances prevalent in the relationship between channel members, and are generally stronger on the side of the franchisor. Further, conflict in franchising relationships is inevitable and may result in positive outcomes, enabling parties to align their respective goals. In recent years, while the departure of car manufacturing impacted both the AAI and the country’s economy, other issues governing the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and their dealers have arisen and these issues have continued to be a concern in the Australian franchise sector. Undoubtedly, commercial arrangements between car manufacturers and their authorised dealers are raising important issues concerning the franchising relationship between both parties. Since the 2015 review of the Code, a market study conducted by the ACCC in 2017 reports that the relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer network is conflictual, noting that many challenges faced by dealers are a consequence of the use of power by car manufacturers. As such, unfair treatment of franchisees undermines not only dealers’ businesses but also the Australian consumers’ best interest (ACCC, 2017). The Australian Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (DIIS) released a Regulation Impact Statement in December 2018 in which they discuss further the franchising relationship between car manufacturers and their dealer networks within the scope of the regulatory framework (DIIS, 2018). It is relevant to note that the Code has introduced, in its latest review, the good faith obligation to ensure that powerful franchise members behave reasonably when seeking a legitimate interest. In the DIIS report, the good faith of car manufacturers is seriously questioned. In fact, the DIIS believes that car manufacturers retain crucial information related to the operation of the franchise system and in choosing not to disclose this information, they may considerably affect the future of dealers’ operations.  This was further reinforced in the 2019 PJCCFS inquiry ‘Fairness in Franchising’. In fact, while the Code contains a number of provisions to request capital expenditure from a franchisee, none of these provisions considers the possibility of non-renewal (PJCCFS, 2008).  For instance, if the franchisee invests a considerable capital expenditure close to the end of the agreement, but the franchise contract is then not renewed by the car manufacturer. This is particularly alarming as dealers do not have any tenure attached to the capital expenditure, which they undertake at the request of the car manufacturer. Hence, dealers who are subject to non-renewal may be placed in an extremely vulnerable situation, especially considering that dispute resolution and litigation are expensive recourses for most dealers in this industry (PJCCFS, 2019). A long-standing contentious issue of the current franchising regulatory framework for the AAI is the allegation that dealers fear recrimination by franchisors when attempting to negotiate or resolve disputes legally (PJCCFS, 2019). Hence, in their attempt to search for fairer contractual terms and other franchising matters, dealers may be left powerless and at the mercy of overseas car manufacturers. Unquestionably, 2020 was quite eventful for the AAI. After 160 years in the Australian market, GM Holden withdrew, announcing the end of its car retail in Australia (Thomson, 2020). This sudden decision lit up a franchise dispute over the compensation package offered by Holden following the termination of its 200 Holden Australian dealers (Thomson, 2020). While the Detroit-based giant refused to negotiate fairer compensation terms requested by its franchised dealers and their advocate bodies, Honda and Mercedes-Benz both announced the transition from franchising to a new distribution model, the agency model (Jemeric, 2020) and Renault followed in January 2021 with its unilateral decision to outsource its retailing activities to an independent distributor (Gardini & Bryant, 2021).  The agency model consists of transitioning a dealer principal from a franchisee to an agent acting on behalf of the car manufacturer. The latter model enables the sale of products through any direct marketing channel (i.e. online sales) and via agents, who will receive a percentage of the profits. These profits are calculated based on the sales and customer satisfaction scores the agent has achieved. Honda estimates profits will be between 4 per cent and 7 per cent of the total sales (Dowling, 2020). The unique feature of this model is that new vehicles will now be sold at a fixed price, leaving no room for competitive advantages for the new agents. However, the operational costs will be reduced for dealers. This is largely due to the floorplan costs, including the stock of vehicles, initially bought and maintained at the franchisee’s costs, whichwill be owned by the franchisors. While this model may seem advantageous for dealers who are currently incurring millions of dollars in expenses, entrepreneurial freedom is at risk (Accenture, 2019). This strategic decision to move to an agency model has brought further franchise disputes as Honda terminated between 30 and 40 of its franchised dealerships – most of which were offered compensation lower than what they had lost (Tillett, 2020). Moreover, both Mercedes-Benz and Honda have been subject to serious allegations for intimidation during negotiation with their dealers along with other allegations regarding data ownership under the agency model and transparency of information to ensure the safe transition of dealers (Regulation of the Relationship between Car Manufacturers and Car Dealers in Australia (Formerly General Motors Holden Operations in Australia), 2020). The recent issues of franchising in the AAI highlighted a need to investigate the nature of the relational, legal and contractual franchising model within which car manufacturers and dealers operate. In fact, by the end of 2020, the Education and Employment References Committee extended the initial Senate inquiry into General Motors Holden Operations in Australia to one that covered the franchising relationship between all car manufacturers and car dealers operating in Australia. In this hearing, both sides of the franchise argument were heard. The Senate hearings included witnesses from four Australian car manufacturers and their industry association, three governmental organisations, four Australian new car dealers’ associations along with one dealer principal and the American-based National Automotive Dealers Association (NADA).  The inquiry has also attracted more than 20 confidential submissions from dealers, which the committee has considered as a strong indication of dealers fearing retaliation by their car manufacturer. The Senate hearing outlined further issues surrounding franchising and agency models in the automotive industry, with recurrent concerns as to whether stronger regulations will push other car manufacturers to leave the Australian market. An important concern followed by a recent exit of Renault as a player in the market  In brief, the literature reveals the complexities of franchising relationships in general and highlights some of the issues related to the franchising model in the AAI. To date, only limited research has investigated the role of the franchising regulatory environment in Australia and its impact on the franchising sector (Atwell & Buchan, 2014; Lim & Frazer, 2002; Terry, 1996). None of these studies dives into the complexities of a particular retail industry – especially one that has proven to be highly conflictual.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH Marketing channels remain a captivating inter-organisational form, inviting researchers from various scholarships, including marketing, management, law and economics, particularly for franchising-related queries. In what follows, suggestions for future research in marketing channels are offered. Most of these focus on franchising and the agency model, the latter still unknown to the academic literature and providing further opportunities to delve into the model disrupting the standard of distribution forms. Economic theorists provide an in-depth understanding of franchising. First, resource-scarcity theorists have offered a thorough analysis of the motives of selecting franchising as a distribution model, including the risks when tangible and intangible assets are transferred. Second, property rights theorists further stress the need to protect intangible assets in franchising. Third, agency theorists have delved into the nature of the relationship between franchisor and franchisee and how the franchisor is called to monitor the relationship in order to maximise profits and minimise shirking and free riding costs. Fourth, upper-echelon theorists opened a debate surrounding the entrepreneurial characteristics of franchisees, and, more recently, stewardship theorists have offered a fresher perspective to the old principal–agent franchising relationship. Finally, institutional theorists have evoked the importance of the franchise system offered by two types of governance structures: the firm and the country’s regulatory framework.   Since the rapid growth of franchising across the globe, there is certainly an advantage to this distribution model, allowing corporations rapid expansion, both nationally and internationally. However, with the expansion of hospitality industries, including hotels and restaurants, research has focused on business format franchising, leaving only limited empirical findings on product and trade name franchising.This franchise typeis used only in the petroleum, automotive and beverage industries Today, there is an important call for a better understanding ofthis franchise model, how it operates in the automotive industry and what has triggered a move to the new model.   Currently, the disruption of retail in the automotive industry is rapidly evolving with the introduction of the agency model in New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and, most recently, Australia. This is a strong call for marketing academics and practitioners, including policymakers, to delve into the how, why and what of this transition. To do that, it will be important to understand what has happened in the automotive industry to date. Researchers may endeavour to approach this matter by considering:  How well understood is the social, legal and contractual franchising relationship between car manufacturers and dealers? What are the strategic difficulties leading to the end of product and trade name franchising through a transition to the agency modelWhat are the strategic differences between a franchise model, an agency model, and the outsourcing model (Renault)? What is the agency model? What does it have to offer as a new marketing channel? How does it benefit (or disadvantage) the consumer, the agent, and the car manufacturer?   How power, control, commitment, performance, and communication is perceived in the agency model? And in comparison, to franchising model and/ or company-owned channel (i.e. corporate channel)?  What are the motivating factors causing a transition to the agency model rather than a move to business format franchising in the same form administered in the fast-food industry or a hybrid between a buy-back of strategic dealerships (i.e. corporate channel) and business format franchisingWhat has become the nature of the legal and contractual relationship in the automotive industry under the agency modelWhat are the legal challenges for AAI regulators in terms of data transfer and ownership?  What theoretical constructs does the agency model offer to the franchising literature under managerial, economic, marketing, and legal lenses? Research in franchising issues has already offered great knowledge, with an emphasis on its strategic, economic and managerial importance. Admittedly, there is still much to learn and further opportunities exist to deepen the future academic work in this field of research. The research opportunities above are by no means an exhaustive list of the future of research in marketing channels in general and franchising in particular.  Turning to Australia as the disruption of the franchising model in the automotive industry continues simultaneously with the legal battle for better regulation in the AAI, practical research into the effect of marketing channels on relational, contractual, and legal aspects can provide greater benefit to all channel members and end-users. As sources of power, and control mechanisms have already received a lot of attention in marketing channel literature, there is little known on the exercise power and control in the AAI and much less on how it will transform as the agency model is settling in.   Undoubtedly, it will be important for all stakeholders in the industry (particularly new car dealers moving from their role of franchisees to agents) to understand the changes in their relationship not only with car manufacturers but also with their customers. It is believed that this new model will offer a better customer experience (Accenture, 2019). However, strong reserves have been expressed by new car dealers, their representants and public servants regarding the allocation of ownership in regard to customer data. Who own the customer data and/or should the customer data be considered part of the compensation package for dealers transitioning to the agency model or those being terminated in the process?  Certainly, the agency model offers higher sources of power and control to car manufacturers over their business model, the operation of their agents and therefore the customer experience. While communication between car manufacturers and agents will be essential for this transition to succeed, it often constitutes a coded reflection of the levels of power and control in inter-organisational relationships. Diving into the past, present, and future of the marketing channels in the automotive industry will offer a fresh understanding of the constructs of cooperation, conflict, dependence and satisfaction with a portfolio for stakeholders to improve relations, service, and regulations in the industry.

We argue that exchange between the franchisor and franchisee influences relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. The higher the franchisor and franchisee’s exchange of relational resources, the higher is the franchisee satisfaction, due to their mediating effect via higher relationship quality. Since economic transactions between the franchisor and franchisee are embedded in social exchange characterized by a certain level of trust, trust influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and hence satisfaction. Our findings based on franchisee data from the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) highlight that exchange positively influences franchisee satisfaction via higher relationship quality but trust negatively moderates the impact of exchange on relationship quality. In a high-trust situation, the effect of exchange on relationship quality is weaker because high embeddedness may inhibit the recognition of the importance of exchange for a high-quality franchise relationship. This study contributes to the social exchange theory perspective of franchise relationships by showing in addition to the previous literature that trust is not only beneficial for relationship quality but may also increase relationship blindness as hidden costs of trust. Therefore, from a managerial perspective, it is important to nurture business relationships by exchange of valued resources between the franchisor and franchisee before resting on the laurels of trust.Key words: franchising, leader-member exchange, social exchange theory, relationship quality, trust, franchisee satisfaction INTRODUCTION Satisfaction of personnel (employees and network partners) becomes an increasingly important issue in management. Franchising is not different in this sense but represents a specific setting. The nature of the specificity lies in the fact that franchisees take on multiple roles – customers, employees, investors, or business partners (Raha & Hajdini, 2020). Moreover, the relationship between franchisor and franchisee is characterized by asymmetry regarding control and mutuality (Davies, Lassar, Manolis, Prince & Winsor, 2011). Nevertheless, franchising is a highly interdependent relationship with both parties striving for and contributing to the profitability of their businesses (Elango & Fried, 1997; Harmon & Griffiths, 2008). Thus, the quality of the relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee is critical for the success of a franchise (McDonnell, Beatson & Huang, 2011; Watson & Johnson, 2010).  Relational characteristics such as satisfaction play a critical role in the franchisee’s willingness to continue the contractual relationship with the franchisor (Beatson, Lings & Gudergan, 2008; Jang & Park, 2019). Franchisee satisfaction is crucial in this regard because it is a predictor for the franchisee’s intention to remain in the contractual relationship and therefore influences the ongoing continuity of the franchise, especially when considering temporary contracts (Gauzente, 2003; McDonnell, Beatson & Huang, 2011; Morrison, 1997). Satisfaction is not only important for the intention to renew an existing contract, but also in terms of advocacy of the franchise system (Lee, Hsu & Huang, 2008). The overall importance of satisfaction is highlighted by its influence on franchise performance. Results from the Franchise Business Review 2018 (Coley, 2018) compare performance of top and bottom quartiles of franchises in terms of franchisee satisfaction. Top quartile franchises recorded 10-times higher unit growth, 40% higher collected royalties, 54% lower turnover of franchisees and their franchisees had 90% higher income. In the spotlight of the above, we see that franchisee satisfaction represents an important factor for the continuity and success of franchise systems. Franchisee satisfaction is strongly related to the quality of the relationship, which is not merely based on economic considerations but also on relational aspects. Exchange is the base for establishing and maintaining a relationship, it is a give (commitment) and take (support) as reciprocation of valued resources of the exchange partners, as outlined in social exchange theory (e.g. Gouldner, 1960; Eisenberger, Armeli, Rexwinkel, Lynch & Rhoades, 2001; Wilson, Sin & Colon , 2010; Foa & Foa, 2012) and applied in leader-member exchange (LMX) theory (Graen, Cashman & Dansereau, 1978; Erdogan & Bauer, 2015; Law-Penrose, Wilson & Taylor, 2015). Based on that, exchange influences the quality of a business relationship, but apart from (relational and economic) satisfaction, trust plays a critical role in the franchisee’s willingness to continue the contractual relationship (Beatson, Lings & Gudergan, 2008; Jang & Park, 2019). Especially trust affects the impact of exchange on relationship quality because it provides a frame of reference by embedding economic transactions in social relations (Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1997,1999), which is especially important in franchise business networks to reduce exchange hazards and to facilitate knowledge sharing and joint problem solving (Minarikova, Mumdziev, Griessmair & Windsperger, 2019). Consequently, the impact of exchange on relationship quality has to consider trust, which embeds the economic transactions between franchisor and franchisee in a larger relationship context.  This paper seeks to contribute to better understand the relationship between the franchise partners and highlights the importance of relational exchange and trust as a basis for relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. We argue that exchange between franchisor and franchisee is embedded in a certain level of trust, which influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. Specifically, our results highlight that trust as element of embeddedness negatively moderates the relationship between exchange and relationship quality. High-trust relationships do not nurture exchange of valued resources between the franchisor and franchisee because of creating a certain level of blindness about the importance of exchange for relationship quality and satisfaction. Hence, this study contributes to the social exchange theory perspective of franchise relationships by showing that, contrary to the previous literature (e.g. Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Gulati & Sythch, 2008; Altinay, Brookes, Madanoglu & Aktas 2014b), trust is not only beneficial for relationship quality but may also increase relationship blindness as hidden costs of trust (Selnes & Sallis, 2003). CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK & HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT While there is a great variety of theories in franchising research that explain the franchise relationship from a franchisor perspective (e.g., Blair & Lafontaine, 2005; Combs, Ketchen, Shook & Short, 2011; Dant, Grünhagen & Windsperger, 2011), less attention has been paid to the franchisor-franchisee relationship from the franchisee perspective (e.g., Grace & Weaven, 2011). One of the theories that sheds some light on this topic is the social exchange theory and its subsequent extensions (Altinay, Brookes, Yeung & Aktas 2014a; Altinay et al., 2014b; Chiou & Droge, 2015; Mignognac, Vandenberghe, Perrigot, El Akremi & Herrbach, 2015). Due to their focus on reciprocal exchange (Gouldner, 1960; Blau, 1964; Copranzano & Mitchell, 2005; Mitchell, Cropanzano & Quisenberry, 2012), social exchange theories acknowledge imperfect social structures such as unequal distribution of power, as present in franchise relationships (Davies, Lassar, Manolis, Prince & Winsor, 2011).  Although there are some similarities between social and economic exchange, Blau (1964) also asserted some differences. While economic exchange is characterized by contractual and therefore specified obligations, such as the franchisee paying royalty and initial fees while the franchisor provides the trade name and system know-how, social exchange do not have the same level of formality and is characterized by embeddedness involving a certain level of trust Andersen, Buch, & Kuvaas, 2020; Kuvaas, Buch, Dysvik, & Haerem, 2012).  Based on research results from social exchange and leader-member exchange (LMX) theory, in the following, we examine the relationship between exchange (franchisee commitment and franchisor support), relationship quality and trust on franchisee satisfaction. Figure 1 provides an overview of our theoretical framework. Exchange between the franchisor and franchisee influences relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. The higher the franchisor and franchisee’s exchange of relational resources through commitment and support, the higher is franchisee satisfaction, due to their mediating effect via higher relationship quality. Since exchange between the franchisor and franchisee is embedded in a certain level of trust, trust influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and hence satisfaction. Figure 1. Theoretical framework Leader-Member Exchange Theory As indicated by the importance the social exchange theory attributes to social ties and relational reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960; Blau 1964; Homans 1974), franchisor-franchisee relationships extend beyond contractual obligations and are characterized by relational exchange between both partners (Macneil, 1983; Dywer, Schurr & Oh, 1987). Both, franchisor and franchisee are bound by a relatively high level of interdependence in terms of their success (Hadfield, 1990). Comparable to other forms of social relations described by Blau (1964), we assert that franchise partners also “exchange advice, help [and] (...) support” (pp. 314-315). The franchisor-franchisee relationship is therefore assumed to represent a hybrid between social and economic exchange as described by Blau (1964) and Macneil (1980). Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX), which originates from Vertical Dyad Linkage theory (Dansereau, Grean & Haga, 1975; Liden & Grean, 1980), represents a theoretical framework that better fits the need for understanding and explaining the formation and development of such dyadic relationships. Erdogan and Bauer (2015) state that LMX theory focuses on relationships between interdependent leaders and members and can be described as “a relationship-based, dyadic theory of leadership” (p. 641). Originally used as a theory of effective leadership, it is also applicable to identify components and their interrelations that affect the franchisor-franchisee relationship (e.g., Aung & Ousawat, 2019; Huong, 2011). When it comes to building high-quality relationships, certain factors can be seen as particularly critical according to the theories of leader-member exchange (Breukelen, Schyns & Le Blanc, 2006). Specifically, LMX theory states that job relationships in which the individual nearly adheres to the requirements of the contract are worse than those in which the individual goes beyond the demands made in the contract (Liden & Graen, 1980). According to LMX theory, both job behavior and job attitude can be positively influenced by the exchange of both parties valued resources (Erdogan and Bauer, 2015, 641) – providing information and support on the part of the leader and increased engagement in challenging tasks on the part of the member. The quintessence of LMX theory is that work attitude and behavior is decisively influenced by both the leader and the member. This influence is exerted by providing relational resources, on the one hand by the leader by providing information and support and on the other hand by the member by getting involved through increased engagement and commitment (Liden et al., 1997). Although LMX is based on the concept of reciprocity of resources (Foe & Foe, 2012; Wilson et al. 2010; Law-Penrose et al., 2015), most LMX measures do not directly capture this very aspect of exchange. In many cases, the quality of the relationship between Leader and Member is measured instead (Liden, Sparrowe & Wayne, 1997; Liden, Wu, Cao, & Wayne, 2015). According to LMX theory, dyadic exchange processes can vary from high-to low-quality relationships (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015; Graen & Schiemann, 1978). In high-quality relationships valued resources are exchanged, such as development opportunities, support activities and mentoring. In return, members will be more motivated and demonstrate more loyalty and voluntary behavior towards their leader (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015).  Different studies found that subordinates’ behavior (whether merely fulfilling or exceeding contractual obligations) is associated with the quality of the relationship with their superior, increasing the subordinates’ performance (Settoon, Bennett & Liden, 1996; Erdogan & Bauer, 2015). The quality of their relationship is in turn linked to productivity and satisfaction (Huong, 2011; Scandura & Graen, 1984). Based on these explanations, it can be assumed that the exchange of relational resources such as advice, support (Blau, 1964) as well as loyalty and voluntary behavior (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015) contribute to establishing and maintaining a high-quality relationship. Contributing factors to relationships are “effort, material resources, information, and/ or emotional support exchanged between the two parties“ (Liden et al. 1997, p. 48). Such types of exchange between franchisor and franchisee form the basis for the development and maintenance of the relationship. The Impact of Exchange on Relationship Quality and Satisfaction A high-quality relationship between the franchisor and franchisee is characterized by reciprocal exchange of valued resources. The first element of exchange is the commitment of the franchisee to the relationship with the franchisor. Among other factors, commitment is important in contributing to overall relationship quality (Altinay & Brookes, 2012; Altinay, Brookes, Yeung & Aktas, 2014; Huong, 2011; Morgan & Hunt, 1994). Contrary to toxic relationships, which are based on coercion due to power, “healthy” relationships are characterized by the feeling of being voluntarily committed to the exchange partner (Morgan & Hunt, 1994). According to Morgan and Hunt (1994), commitment can be understood as the belief that the importance of a relationship justifies “maximum efforts” (p. 23) in order to maintain it. Commitment is essential to ensure its lasting effect by influencing attitudes and behaviors of both the franchisor and the franchisee (Harmon & Griffiths, 2008). The second element of exchange is the support of the franchisor to the franchisee, so that the franchisee can be successful. The commitment provided by the franchisee corresponds with matching support from the franchisor, forming a reciprocal exchange. Support provided by the franchisor through ongoing support activities (such as trainings, manuals etc.) is an important factor for creating a cooperative relationship and contributing to franchisee satisfaction (Davies et al., 2011; Morrison, 1996). The possible reason for this is hypothesized to be that support activities facilitate knowledge transfer to the franchisee (Minguela-Rata, Lopez-Sanchez & Rodriguez-Benavides, 2010). It can hence be seen as a “bridging mechanism” between exchange partners that helps establishing a high-quality relationship (Huong, 2011). As mentioned above, the franchise relationship is characterized by the dyadic exchange of valued resources (Mitchell et al., 2012; Erdogan & Bauer, 2015) and can thus be understood as an interdependent relational process. While support activities can mainly be attributed to the franchisor, the franchisee responds with increased commitment in this exchange process. This means commitment is adjusted accordingly. Therefore, exchange from the franchisee’s perspective represents the relational give (franchisee’s commitment) and take (franchisor’s support) as reciprocal resource contributions of the franchise partners (Gouldner, 1960; Eisenberger et al., 2001). This in turn influences the relationship between both franchise partners and its quality, as it is built through exchange (Dansereau, Graen & Haga, 1975). Thus, we postulate the following hypothesis (see Figure 1).  The impact of exchange on franchisee satisfaction is mediated by relationship quality. Exchange, Relationship Quality and the Moderating Role of Trust Based on the principle of reciprocity, people conduct social exchanges in order to receive something of value in return. By exchanging favors or other acts and receiving rewards on both sides, the parties involved form a social bond between them which evolves to a social relation (Harmon & Griffiths, 2008; Liden, Sparrowe & Wayne, 1997). The stability of this relation is directly influenced by the exchange partner’s support and commitment as resource contributions. However, since there is no guarantee for receiving reciprocal contributions of relational resources, social exchange requires trust.Based on the perceived level of openness and support provided by the franchisor, embeddedness through trust (Granovetter, 1985) acts as reinforcing effect to align interests of both parties and helps improving relationship quality by creating a nourishing environment (Davies, et al. 2011; Liu, Luo & Liu, 2009). This applies to franchise relationships which are a form of dyadic exchange (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015) where both business partner’s give and take is especially crucial at the onset of the relationship. Developing through actions of both parties, franchisor-franchisee relationship is characterized by trust generated through social exchange as well as by the interdependence between the parties.  Thus, trust is an important building block in social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) which has been applied as one of the core components in empirical research using the theory (Lambe, Wittman and Spekman, 2001). Specifically, trust has been defined as a willingness to rely on an exchange partner in whom one has confidence (Moorman, Zaltman & Deshpande, 1992, p. 315). By this definition, trust as element of embeddedness (Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1999) – temporarily – substitutes exchange of valued resources (such as franchisor support through knowledge sharing and franchisee commitment), or better to say, compensates for momentary deficiencies in the exchange. Consequently, since exchange between the franchisor and franchisee is embedded in trust, it influences the impact of exchange on relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. In low-trust contexts, the effect of exchange of valued resources on relationship quality is pronounced. In this low-embeddedness setting, the relationship between the partners depends on the dyadic exchange (Erdogan & Bauer, 2015). From the beginning the relationship between franchisee and franchisor quickly evolves away from discrete, small-risk transactions to continuous, high-risk and high-stake transactions typical for franchise setting (which is further pronounced by the need to establish franchisee’s business at the start). For this reason, gradual build-up of the relationship, which is assumed in the social exchange theory (Lambe, Wittman and Spekman, 2001), is not possible. Furthermore, a low level of trust means by its definition (Moorman, Zaltman & Deshpande, 1992) a low level of willingness to rely on the partner – in this setting, high-quality relationship thus requires a constant reciprocal exchange to keep uncertainty at bay. In contrast, in high-trust contexts, the role of exchange becomes less important for a high-quality relationship as the franchisee is willing to rely on the franchisor (Moorman, Zaltman & Deshpande, 1992). In this high embeddedness situation, exchange moves to the background and its effect on relationship quality is weaker. Furthermore, in this high-trust setting, high embeddedness (Uzzi, 1997) may endanger the exchange of relational resources by creating a certain level of blindness inhibiting the recognition of the importance of exchange for relationship quality (McEvily et al., 2003). We, therefore, formulate the following hypothesis (see Figure 1):  Trust negatively moderates the effect of Exchange on Relationship Quality. METHODOLOGY Data Collection & Sample The data were collected in two rounds in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). First, between April 2018 and March 2019 and in a second between March 2019 and May 2019 through both online and printed versions of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was accompanied with a cover letter promising that information will be aggregated and treated anonymously. The target group for the questionnaire were respondents who own and manageat least one franchise outlet. For this reason, we excluded answers by outlet managers. The response rate for the questionnaire was 8%. The final sample consisted of 105 observations. The outlets are doing business in fitness (27%), education services (26%) and gastronomy (19%). Measurement The scales were adopted or adapted from existing literature and exhibited good internal consistency (see Table 1 for the descriptive statistics of the variables). The dependent variable, franchisee satisfaction, is measured by six items from Chiou et al. (2004). While exchange has been operationalized by various dimensions in previous LMX research (e.g., Gottfredson, Wright, Heaphy, 2020; Gooty, Servan, Thomas, Gavin & Yammarino, 2012), the most important aspect is exchange of relational resources through commitment and support (Wilson et al. 2010, Foa and Foe 2012 and Law-Penrose et al. 2015). Based on the conceptualizations by Kumar, Hibbard and Stern (1994), Bishop, Scott, Goldsby and Cropanzano (2005) and Erdogan and Bauer (2015), we measure Exchange with support and commitment by using items representing franchisor support and items for representing franchisee commitment. The moderator variable, Trust (three items), is adapted from Wu (2015) and the mediator variable, Relationship Quality, is adapted as well (Jap, Manolis and Weitz, 1999; Weaven, Baker and Dant, 2017). Finally, two control variables have been included: Financial performance is measured by five items from Chiou and Droge (2015) and Delgado-García, Rodríguez-Escudero & Martín-Cruz (2015). These five items were compared to two performance benchmarks (in line with Cyert & March, 1963) – own historical and performance of peers, in this case other shops in the area. Finally, we asked franchisees for the year when they started their business. The correlation matrix (Table A.1) as well as the item list (Table A.2) are presented in the Appendix. Table 1. Descriptive Statistics Variable Mean (Standard Deviation) Exchange (6 items, α = 0.76) 4.00 (0.66) Trust (3 items, α = 0.86) 3.82 (1.03) Relationship Quality (7 items, α = 0.96) 3.86 (1.03) Franchisee Satisfaction (6 items, α = 0.94) 4.02 (1.07) Financial Performance (10 items, α = 0.93) 3.39 (0.77) Business Age 10.11 (6.84) Results We specified and estimated a moderated mediation model in PROCESS (Hayes 2018) to test the hypotheses, see Table 2 for the individual regression results. During the analysis structural multicollinearity (VIF > 10) was detected, likely due to model specification (interaction term) in the regression on relationship quality. As a remedy, we used the mean-centered variables in the regression models and as a result variance inflation factors remained at low levels (VIF < 3), indicating no issues of multicollinearity. The testing of the moderated mediation was conducted in one step but is presented in two parts to follow the order of the hypotheses. We tested the hypotheses by examining 1) the effect of exchange on franchisee satisfaction mediated by relationship quality (H1), and 2) the moderation of the effect of exchange by trust on relationship quality (H2).

The results revealed that the mediation of exchange by relationship quality on franchisee satisfaction was significant at three selected levels of the moderator because the bootstrapped confidence interval does not include zero, see Table 3, providing support for H1.

Regarding the moderation of exchange by trust on relationship quality, we can see in Table 2 that the moderation (Trust*Exchange) is negative and significant at p < 0.01, providing support for H2. This means that the effect of exchange on relationship quality becomes attenuated as trust increases which is also indicated by the decrease of the indirect effect as the level of trust increases (see Table 3). In addition, the index of moderated mediation (Hayes 2015) provides further support for the two hypotheses, because the bootstrapped 95% CI of the index does not include zero; index = - 0.112 [- 0.229; - 0.030]. Thus, we find support for a moderated mediation (H1 and H2) of exchange by trust via relationship quality on satisfaction. The key effects of the model are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Overview of Effects. Note: *** p < 0.001; * p < 0.05; 95% Confidence intervals (CI) are displayed in squared brackets.  As follow-up, we probed the moderation with the Johnson-Neyman technique in PROCESS to check the moderation effect on a more fine-grained level. We did not find any significant transition points within the range of the moderator even upon inspection of more values between the selected percentiles; the moderator was significant over the whole value range (p < 0.05). In order to visualize the moderation effect, we used a pick-a-point approach, and plotted the results in Figure 3. Figure 3.

It should be noted that the benefit of trust is reduced, as exchange of relational resources increases. The probing of the interaction showed that even for high levels of exchange, trust is beneficial, but the impact of exchange on relationship quality is reduced. An increase in exchange is most beneficial when levels of trust are low, which is most likely the case when a business relationship has just started. Increasing contributions of relational resources provides a viable tool to improve relationship quality quickly, whereas trust might need more time to be built up. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Franchisee satisfaction is a key factor that marks successful franchises (Coley, 2018). Further, when we acknowledge that franchisee satisfaction influences the decision to remain in the franchise system (Beatson, Lings & Gudergan, 2008; Jang & Park, 2019), dissatisfied franchisees are harmful for both parties of the franchise relationship. The importance of this topic is pronounced by the fact that the turnover rate in franchise systems is around 10% (e.g., Franchising USA, 2017; Tuunanen & Torikka, 2008). Relationship quality is then in turn important for the franchisee satisfaction (e.g., Morrison, 1996). Our research sheds further light on the complex nature of linkages between these factors, supporting a moderated mediation of exchange by trust via relationship quality on franchisee satisfaction. We found that trust is not only beneficial for relationship quality (as in, e.g., Morgan & Hunt, 1994) but its role is even more pronounced in low exchange settings. Unfortunately, the benefits of trust cannot be reaped immediately as trust has to be built-up gradually in the franchise relationship (e.g., Davies et al., 2011). In order to understand what happens on a basic social exchange level and in terms of relational development in a franchise context, we applied social exchange and LMX theory to franchise systems and tried to capture the give-and-take of social ties beyond basic economic considerations (Blau, 1964) which would then affect relationship quality. Exchange from both sides of the relationship can have a strong impact on relationship quality without necessitating ingrained trust which needs to be built-up over time (this can be extended from our findings because we controlled for age of the business relationship in the model). As a result, exchange can substitute in the absence of trust. This can be conceptualized in the following way: Familiarity with another party can be built by frequent committed exchange of relational resources and can therefore substitute and establish mutual commitment. This result is complementary to previous research, where relational exchanges are likely to lead to higher trust in the long term because familiarity with the other party breeds trust (Macneil, 1983; Gulati & Sytch, 2008; Altinay et al. 2014b). We also add to previous literature that has discussed the importance of social aspects in franchise relationships (e.g., Huong, 2011) by illustrating the importance of exchange on relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction. Moreover, the results also reveal that when trust is established, there might be less incentive for relational exchange to improve relationship quality because the marginal value of investing in a higher-trust relationship diminishes (the slope becomes flatter as trust levels increase, see Figure 3). Thus, this might show that high-trust relationships are more easily maintained once a certain level of trust is reached but, in this high embeddedness setting, it may increase the risk and appeal of opportunistic behavior (Selnes & Sallis, 2003). Hence, from a utility maximizing viewpoint, the incentive to increase commitment or support decreases as trust is built-up. Research has explored the “dark side of trust” in various business relationships and discussed the destructive impact of high trust on relationship outcomes (Anderson & Jap, 2005; Skinner, Dietz & Weib, 2013). This highlights the relevance and implications of such behavior in dyadic business relationships on a more general level than only in franchise networks. 4.1 Managerial Implications In this empirical study of franchise systems, we illustrated that relationship quality driven by exchange is highly relevant in keeping franchisees satisfied. Thus, exchange can make or break a business and is crucial for the success and survival of the business relationship which is especially fragile in the beginning of its establishment. Especially at this stage our findings provide insights, namely that an increased level of exchange profit relationship quality over-proportionally when trust levels are low. Therefore, a focus on meaningful and supportive exchange of relational resources is especially advised in the beginning of the relationship to improve relationship quality instantly and potentially gain additional trust effects in the long-term.  As trust increases the marginal impact of exchange on satisfaction decreases. This means that an investment in exchange of relational resources useful for the franchisee in terms of know-how are most beneficial when trust is low, so likely when the business relationship between franchisee and franchisor has been recently established. Subsequently, when trust has been solidified, a reduction in exchange is likely to optimize the trade-off between associated costs and impact on satisfaction. This can be exploited as an opportunistic efficiency gain as further investments for a high-quality relationship can be reduced while maintaining the same relationship quality level, allowing resources to be focused elsewhere. We see that financial incentives or performance are not sufficient to sustain high franchisee satisfaction, especially when a less favorable economic environment pushes down financial performance. This indicates that engaging in exchange is a form of relationship investment that pays off with higher relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction, which is beneficial for both parties. Further, exchanges lead to the build-up of trust. While high trust could be exploited, it also presents a cushion against deficiencies in exchange. In a high trust setting, the impact of problems in the exchange are largely substituted by trust, as evident from our research, at least in the short term. This is very important under uncertain or unstable conditions. We suggest that franchise parties should consider exchange of relational resources as a continuous investment in the relationship although the incremental improvement of relationship quality diminishes with increased levels of trust. When such a positive approach toward the relationship has been established it will profit both parties, increasing franchisee satisfaction, performance and reducing their turnover (Coley, 2018). 4.2 Limitations and Future ResearchOur findings are limited by the fact that we studied the topic only from the perspective of the franchisee. While we bring forward a number of reasons why franchisee satisfaction is important for the franchise success, franchisor’s perspective would be informative especially in the terms of boundaries of the relationship. Complementarily, future studies could explore the perspective of the franchisor or combine both perspectives of franchisor and franchisee on relational exchange to obtain a comprehensive view and perceptual differences of this subject. Further, we only used perceptual measures of exchange as indicated by the franchisee, assuming that this represents the interdependent exchange between franchisor and franchisee. We would argue that this a rather safe assumption because reciprocity in such business relationships, meaning exchange, trust, and relationship quality will be reflected similarly in the perception of both parties. In addition, we are considering franchisee satisfaction, so it is meaningful to approach exchange from this perspective. Naturally, undetected opportunistic behavior on either side (no real reciprocity) is a possibility but over time would be identified and sanctioned, meaning such an imbalance would only be a temporary state. Therefore, we consider this to be negligible for our sample and findings. Further, as this study applied a cross-sectional design, long-term effects can only be extrapolated with due caution. Future research could look through longitudinal studies at how exchange, trust, relationship quality and franchisee satisfaction evolve over time. This would shed more light on the dynamic nature of these factors in franchise relationships. 5. CONCLUSIONS In our research, we explored the relational side of the franchise satisfaction by applying social exchange and LMX theory. Our empirical results provide support for moderated mediation of exchange by trust via relationship quality on franchisee satisfaction. This has various implications for both research and practice, as it shows how exchange enhances relationship quality that induces franchisee satisfaction. We also show that trust presents an important component in the relationship that creates not only benefits for both parties in the franchise relationship. However, in high embeddedness context, high trust may result in strategic blindness of the franchise partners not recognizing the importance of exchange for relationship quality. Therefore, from a managerial perspective, it is important to nurture business relationships by exchange of valued resources between the franchisor and franchisee before resting on the laurels of trust.Knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising network: Antecedents and performance outcomesMiona Pajić  PhD student Faculty of Business, Economics and Statistics University of Vienna Vienna, Austria, 1090 Telephone: +4367761633187 Email: coccinella.pajic@gmail.com Univ.-Prof. Dr. Josef Windsperger Professor of Organization and Management Department of Business Decisions and Analytics Faculty of Business, Economics and Statistics University of Vienna Vienna, Austria, 1090 Presented at the 34thAnnual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School May 24-26, 2021 Knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising network: Antecedents and performance outcomesAbstract This study investigates the antecedents and performance outcomes of knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising networks. The knowledge management field remains important in the era of constant learning. By applying the knowledge-based theory and the relational governance view, this paper provides new insights into the factors that influence the choice of different information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms. The results suggest that the franchisor has to choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness, to support the transfer of the tacit knowledge and improve performance in the franchising networks. In addition, the transfer of explicit knowledge will be facilitated by mechanisms with low information richness, which will enable better performance.  Keywords: Information richness, Knowledge transfer, Knowledge transfer mechanisms, Franchising, Performance Introduction Knowledge is one of the key factors for gaining a competitive advantage (Argote and Ingram 2000). As previous research indicates, knowledge transfer plays important role in achieving success in intra- and interorganizational networks (Maskell and Malmberg 1999; Paswan and Wittmann 2009; Minguela-Rata et al. 2010). The efficiency of knowledge transfer depends on many factors, including willingness and capability to transfer it (Kogut and Zander, 1993). Knowledge is characterized by different factors, such as tacitness, trust and communication openness, which influence the choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms. The knowledge is \"created and organized by the very flow of information\" (Nonaka 1994, p.15). The transfer of knowledge is present when some organization is affected by the experience of another organization (Argote and Ingram 2000). In this research, the study focuses on the determinants and performance outcome of knowledge transfer mechanisms in the franchising networks. Specifically, we examine, based on the franchisor's perspective, the effect of knowledge transfer mechanisms on franchisor performance. In the theoretical framework, the transfer of knowledge is explained by applying the knowledge-based view (e.g. Kogut and Zander, 1993; Nonaka 1994; Srećković and Windsperger, 2011). In addition to the knowledge-based view, this research uses the relational governance view (Dyer and Singh 1998) to develop the theoretical framework. According to the knowledge-based view, the organization is a system that enables the creation and transfer of more tacit knowledge (Nonaka 1994; Grant 1996). This paper, based on the knowledge-based view, argues that different levels of knowledge tacitness influence the choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms.  It also provides understanding of the impact of trust and communication on knowledge transfer mechanisms by using the relational governance relational view. In this way, the paper provides an extended view of antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms.  LITERATURE REVIEW  In recent years, researchers have investigated a variety of approaches to knowledge transfer. This is expected because the role of knowledge itself has a major impact on the firm’s competitive advantage. As knowledge implies know-how, brand name, and everything that belongs to specific-assets of a franchisor, thus making the transfer of those knowledge assets highly important for business (Iddy and Alon 2019). Levine and Prietula (2012) argue that knowledge transfer does not improve performance outcomes in every case. Tacit knowledge management requires an understanding of the more complex background, including learning within organizations and through societal institutions (Lam 2000). Also, an important aspect is the sharing of tacit knowledge (Lam 2000). Many studies researched the absorptive capacity, addressing particularly the extent to which the recipient is prepared to receive knowledge from a sender (e.g. Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Easterby-Smith et al. 2008). Transfer of tacit knowledge is influenced by trust and forehand involvement (Foos et al. 2006). In the franchise system, a franchisor needs to delegate knowledge to franchisees in the appropriate manner. Understanding and applying the system know-how at the local market is crucial. The intangible (tacit) system knowledge is difficult to transfer (Teece 1985). It requires more effort in a way of \"teaching, demonstration and participation\" (Teece 1985, p.229). More precise insight into the process and content of knowledge transfer is needed (Foos et al. 2006).  Besides, an appropriate transfer mechanism should be applied (Jasimuddin 2007). As Ramadhan et al. (2017) argue, the difference regarding the formality of mechanisms should be also taken into account. This research aims to investigate performance outcomes from the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms with different information richness. Table 1 presents the examples of the research papers with different approaches in this field.

The research is focused on \"the generative mechanisms\" for the transfer of scientific knowledge (2021, p.1). Arnett et al. 2021 It addresses a sample of 215 salespeople. Focus is on the tacit knowledge transferred between sales and marketing professionals.   The authors state that the quality of communication and mutual understanding are important factors in the transfer. Current research shows a focus on knowledge transfer efficiency, as well as, knowledge transfer performance. A large number of papers put attention to the transfer of tacit knowledge and absorptive capability. Also, some research addresses motivation for knowledge transfer in the firm setting and human behavior regarding knowledge sharing. The research gap, that this study tried to address, is reflected in the relationship between different information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms and franchise performance, by taking into account the tacitness level of the knowledge. In addition, this paper combines the knowledge-based theory and the relational governance view. In this sense, it examines the role of trust and communication for the choice of knowledge transfer mechanisms with different degrees of information richness.Theoretical background Since this research is based on the knowledge-based theory, this section provides an explanation of the knowledge characteristics and the concept of information richness of knowledge transfer mechanisms. Further, based on the relational governance view, antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms (trust and communication openness) are presented.The research aim is based on the following theoretical framework (see Figure 1). Figure 1: Theoretical framework Knowledge-Basedtheory- Knowledge attributes(Codifiability,Complexity)Relational Governance View- Trust- CommunicationKnowledge transfer mechanismsPerformanceKnowledge attributes The vast majority of scientific papers use categories of tacit and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is defined as the asset derived from a system of a company (Calantone, Cavusgil and Zhao 2002). Therefore, it is hard to transfer (Kogut and Zander1993). On the contrary, explicit knowledge can be codified and transferred through written materials (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995).  To explain the impact of knowledge attributes on the choice of knowledge transfer mechanism in this study, the degree of knowledge tacitness is used. This variable is operationalized through codifiability and complexity.This approach is derived from Winter (1987), Kogut and Zander (1993), Zander and Kogut (1995). Codifiability provides information on the extent to which is possible to encode knowledge and define it through written materials. It is much easier to share knowledge by using manuals, rules or other written media. Complexity is defined “as the number of critical and interacting elements embraced by an entity or activity” (Kogut and Zander 1993, p.633). It is highly connected with tacitness because tacit knowledge is viewed as more complex. Codifiability and complexity are used according to Teece (1985) and Winter (1987). To get closer to the meaning of knowledge transfer mechanism as a communication medium, it is important to present the information richness theory. This concept is discussed in more detail in the next section. Information richness concept Information richness theory plays an important role in many studies that focus on characteristics of knowledge. Daft and Lengel (1984) created the concept of information richness. This theory analyzes which is the most suitable mechanism or medium of communication. Different degrees of ambiguity requires different mechanisms (Daft et al. 1987). Sheer and Chen (2004) stress that the balance between requirements of information processing and adequate medium is inevitable for the appropriate transfer. The medium has a high degree of information richness under personal communication. For instance, face-to-face interaction is the richest mechanism for communication. It enables direct and immediate feedback. On contrary, different written documents (like data, reports) do not allow instant feedback. Thus, their information richness is low. According to Simon (1957), organizations are social systems, dedicated to the efficient processing of information. In this case, the information primarily relates to explicit knowledge, which is mainly transferred by low information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms. In contrast, the knowledge-based view explains organization as the system that enables the creation and transfer of more tacit knowledge (Nonaka 1994; Grant 1996), whereby its transfer requires a more high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanism.  Knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising In the last decade, knowledge transfer problems attracted significant attention. The authors addressed knowledge transfer mechanisms by using various constructs. For instance, Chen et al. (2014) use replication and adaptation, to explain mechanisms of transfer. Replication means to replicate the partner's business model. The adaptation refers to the extent of how much one partner combines and modifies practices of the other partner.  Liyanage et al. (2009) refer to modes of knowledge transfer that are used in the relation between source and receiver. Windsperger and Gorovaia (2011) investigate the relationship between knowledge attributes and transfer mechanisms.They adapt measurement according to Daft and Lengel (1984) and Vickery et al. (2004).  In this research, we use a broader range of transfer mechanisms. A lot of studies focus on training, as the mechanism with high information richness. The new technologies provide more communication possibilities, which makes transfer easier. This implies communication through different electronic media, like emails, messages (SMS), and different chat applications. Changes in technology creation, regarding new applications, occur rapidly. To capture the construct of knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness, this study uses face-to-face, telephone calls, and instant messages. In this way, we addressed mechanisms that enable fast response (Vickery et al. 2004). The construct of knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness includes email and different written and numeric material. This group differs from the previous one because those mechanisms disable visual effects and fast response (Vickery et al. 2004). This study investigates the relationship between the knowledge attributes and mechanisms of knowledge transfer in franchising networks. The franchising context implies that the franchisor transfers a business concept to the franchisee(s). While the franchisor guides the main business model, a franchisee can operate an independent business. The training plays a key role in efficient knowledge transfer (Welch, Benito, and Petersen 2018). Thus, franchisees need to easily approach and learn new knowledge, to apply it successfully.  Franchisors, according to the contract, transfer tacit and explicit knowledge to franchisees (Windsperger and Dant 2006; Ghantous and Das 2018). Explicit knowledge, transferred to franchisees, should be understandable enough to be codified in handbooks (Perrigot et al. 2017). Based on previous research results, we expect that tacit knowledge will require a transfer mechanism with a higher degree of information richness. On the other hand, the explicit knowledge will be transferred by using mechanisms with a lower degree of information richness. Hence, we derive the following hypotheses: H1a: The more explicit franchisor's knowledge is positively related to the knowledge transfer mechanisms with a lower degree of information richness. H1b: The more tacit franchisor's knowledge is positively related to the knowledge transfer mechanisms with a higher degree of information richness. Trust and knowledge transfer mechanisms Many studies confirm that trust plays an important role. Knowledge, especially the one specific to the company, requires the reliability of all actors. Trust exists when partners believe and are confident in the positive actions of other partners (Anderson and Narus 1990; Morgan and Hunt 1994). To share knowledge, even within companies, trustful cooperation is required. Currall and Judge (1995) emphasize that accuracy of shared information and knowledge could decrease in the process of collaboration without trust. The process of inter-organizational knowledge sharing increases when supported by trust (Sahay 2003). As Gulati (1995) and Yu et al. (2006) state, trust reduces relational risk. Further, it decreases the hazards of knowledge transfer (1995, 2006). In this situation, there is a higher probability that under the higher level of trust, a franchisor will use transfer mechanisms with a lower level of information richness (Lo and Lie 2008). Conversely, the lack of trust would eventually lead to the use of mechanisms with a higher level of information richness. According to the theoretical background, the hypotheses are as follows: H2a: When trust increases, the use of high information richness knowledge transfer mechanisms decreases. H2b: When trust increases, the use of low information richness knowledge transfer mechanisms increases. Communication openness and knowledge transfer mechanisms Communication plays a key role in various business contexts. To reach recipients, knowledge has to be appropriately communicated. This makes transfer easier and more successful. Some earlier works suggest that communication openness, supported with control and organization support, improves entrepreneurial behavior (e.g. Guth and Ginsberg 1990). As KaleSingh, and Perlmutter (2000) argue, open communication in a franchising context improves information exchange between parties to achieve the common goals. As a result, this leads to satisfaction into the business relationship (Grace et al. 2013). Forming a team with an opportunity to communicate will improve knowledge sharing (Ming-Chang et al. 2013). Hence, the extent of communication influences the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms and the success of knowledge transfer (Daft and Lengel 1986; Williams 2007; Maalouf et al. 2020).  H3a: Communication openness is positively related to knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness. H3b: Communication openness is positively related to knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness. Knowledge transfer mechanisms and franchise performance Many studies show the positive performance effect of the knowledge transfer. For instance, Dhanaraj et al. (2004) state that there is a positive impact of explicit knowledge on performance in international joint ventures. Wu (2016) uses knowledge transfer as a mediator between formal contracts and performance and shows that effect is supported. De Luca and Cano Rubio (2019) argue that efficient transfer leads to competitive advantage. To measure the extent of transfer efficiency, they use the knowledge amount and velocity of the process. Minguela-Rata et al. (2010, p.396) use three transfer mechanisms: \"training, manuals, and services of support\" and investigate their impact on performance. In Table 2, we present some examples from previous research examples.  Table 2: Research studies examples Author  Year Results Slaughter and Kirsch  2006  They state that adjusted type and frequency of the mechanisms improve the performance of the recipient (field study in an IS department). Minguela-Rata et al.  2009  The impact of knowledge complexity on performance in a franchise system; results support positive relation.  Guzman and Trivelato  2008  The socio-technical approach is better support for codified knowledge transfer than the top-down approach (empirical evidence from a Steelworks plant)  Minguela-Rata et al.  2010  Knowledge mechanisms and performance relationship. As a result, support services have the greatest impact on performance. Moon et al.  2021  They examine franchisors’ capabilities and willingness for knowledge transfer and show that franchisees’ willingness acquire knowledge improves franchisees’ performance. We derive the following hypotheses: H4a: Knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness are positively related to performance. H4b: Knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness are positively related to performance. The conceptual model depicts the relationship between knowledge transfer mechanisms with high and low information richness and performance outcomes, as well as, the antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms.  Figure 2: Conceptual model Empirical analysis To undertake this research, a survey is employed. The collected data include 1245 franchise systems. Those systems cover next countries: Germany (577 franchise systems), Austria (374), Czech Republic (165), and Slovakia (129). Finally, 168 observations are used in the analysis.  This study uses partial least square (PLS) analysis in statistical program WARP PLS version 7.0. CB-SEM (covariance-based SEM) does not allow testing of formative constructs due to identification problems (Sarstedt et al. 2016). This is the main reason for applying PLS-SEM (PLS structural equations modelling). PLS-SEM gives the possibility to capture both formative and reflective constructs, which is enabled by the use of the least-squares estimation procedure (Podsakoff et al. 2006).  The conceptual model includes three dependent variables, six independent variables, and two control variables, as noted in the following sections. The two dependent variables are knowledge transfer mechanisms and performance.  For knowledge transfer mechanisms, two variables are used separately, namely, these are knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness (Model 1) and knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness (Model 2). Those measures are built according to Daft and Lengel (1984), Vickery et al. (2004), and Gorovaia and Windsperger (2010). Knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness (KTMH) is a formative construct that includes the following mechanisms: face-to-face (training, meetings, visits), telephone calls, and instant message (mobile, chat applications, etc.). Knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness (KTML) are measured as a formative construct, with the following mechanisms: emails, written formal (documents, manuals), and numeric formal (accounting data). Formative measures are used according to the theoretical reasons (Diamantopoulos 2006). The constructs are created, respecting the rules for indicator retention, like indicator weights and VIF (each indicator's tolerance) values (Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer 2001;Diamantopoulos and Siguaw 2006). The question regarding measure is: \"To what extent do you use the following knowledge transfer mechanisms to communicate with your franchisees?“  Performance measure, used as a reflective construct, has a theoretical background in scientific works of Gorovaia and Windsperger (2013) and Kale and Singh (2007). The construct of performance (PERF) includes the following items:system growth; the increase of revenues and more profitability. The question is: “To what extent did you achieve the following performance criteria in the last year?” Independent variables (reflective constructs), used in the research, are as follows: TRUST: Trust measure with the theoretical background from Blomqvist, Sundqvist, & Seppänen (2007). COD: knowledge attributes - codifiability (Gorovaia and Windsperger (2010)) COMPLEX: knowledge attributes- complexity (Gorovaia and Windsperger (2010)) COMM: communication openness (KaleSingh, and Perlmutter (2000); Grace et al.(2013)) All items and constructs are presented in Appendix. The control variables include the age of the franchise system and the size of the franchise. Age (AGE) presents the number of years since opening the first franchise outlet. Size (SIZE) presents the sum of company-owned and franchise outlets.

Model 1 depicts the positive effect of complexity, trust, and communication openness on knowledge transfer mechanisms, thus supporting hypotheses H1b and H3a. Model 2 in Table 4 present the antecedents of knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness. The results present the positive and significant impact of codifiability, trust, and communication openness. Thus, hypotheses H1a, H2b, and H3b. Next we analyse the performance impact of knowledge transfer mechanisms by applying PLS models.  Model 1 tests the relationship between knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness (KTMH) and performance. Model 2 tests the relationship between knowledge transfer mechanisms with low information richness (KTML) and performance.

The results from Table 5 show that knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness positively influence performance. Thus, hypothesis H4a is supported.  Concerning antecedents of high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms, the results show positive and significant effects of trust and communication openness. Hypothesis H3a is supported. Indicators of model fit show an acceptable level (AVIF and AFVIF are acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3).   According to the theory, we expect that the more tacit franchisor´s knowledge will require the use of high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms.  In addition, open communication builds trust and improves knowledge transfer. The result referring to the significant effect of trust in Model 1 could provide a new future research question. It can be explained by the overall positive information-exchange effect of trust that improves knowledge transfer regardless of the mechanisms that are used. In both groups of knowledge transfer mechanisms, trust plays an important role. Finally, there is a significant coefficient of the size and age of the franchise system. The results in Table 6 (Model 2) provide a significant coefficient of knowledge transfer mechanisms on performance. This result could imply that when the franchisor facilitates the transfer of the explicit knowledge by using low information-rich mechanisms it makes a significant effect on the franchise performance. The results of Model 2 show a significant impact of codifiability, trust, communication openness, size, and age. The hypotheses H1a, H2b, and H3b are supported. Model fit indicators show acceptable levels (AVIF and AFVIF are acceptable if <= 5, ideally <= 3.3). Theoretically, the franchisor will choose low information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms to transfer more explicit knowledge.  Contribution and Implications  In this paper, we developed a model that tests the antecedents and impact of knowledge transfer mechanisms on performance in franchising networks by applying the knowledge-based view (Kogut and Zander 1993; Nonaka 1994; Grant 1996) and relational governance view (Dyer and Singh 1998).  This research extends the franchise literature on the influence of knowledge attributes (knowledge-based view), trust, and communication openness (relational governance view) on knowledge transfer mechanisms with different degrees of information richness. Specifically, it extends the knowledge management research by focusing on the performance implications of knowledge transfer mechanisms in franchising networks.This paper also has practical implications in franchising. Franchisors have to choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with adequate levels of information richness, to improve performance. Thereby the main drive of choosing the knowledge transfer mechanism is the degree of knowledge tacitness. As the findings of the regression analysis show, the franchisor will choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness to enable the transfer of more tacit knowledge. On contrary, in the case of more explicit knowledge the franchisors choose knowledge transfer mechanisms with lower information richness. Furthermore, the PLS results indicate that knowledge transfer mechanisms with high information richness have a significant impact on performance in the franchising networks, which is also confirmed in the case of low information-rich mechanisms. This can be explained by the fact that both tacit and explicit knowledge have a strong impact on performance. This finding is a reminder of the role that knowledge transfer mechanisms have. Therefore, it suggests that the decision regarding the use of knowledge transfer mechanisms with different information richness should be made carefully, to improve the franchise performance outcome.  Limitations and future researchThis study has several limitations. The first limitation is in the range of knowledge that is conceptualized in this empirical research. Since no franchisee knowledge data were available, we could only focus on the impact of the franchisor knowledge attributes on the choice of knowledge transfer mechanism. Future studies could include also the knowledge of franchisees. A further limitation is associated with the construct of trust. Knowledge-based trust is one important dimension, but the other one is general trust (Lazzarini et al. 2008). If the franchisor has a high level of general trust, this might reduce the use of high information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms and increase the use of low information-rich knowledge transfer mechanisms.

Nasri Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship and International Business Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University Half Moon Bay, Al-Khobar 31952, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia bnasri@pmu.edu.sa Pablo Collazzo Yelpo Professor of Socioeconomics Grenoble Ecole de Management 12, rue Pierre Sémard, F - 38000 Grenoble, France pablo.collazzo@grenoble-em.com Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School UNSW Business School May 24-26, 2021 Internationalization Challenges for Saudi Arabian Fast-Food Franchises:  The Case of Kudu Abstract The purpose of this research is to answer the question “How do local Saudi Arabian fast-food franchises grow into international chains, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization”. Franchising in Saudi Arabia is barely addressed in literature, despite the presence and the prominence of local franchise brands, many of which successfully expanded inside and across borders. The country is the biggest market of the Middle East. While changes and reforms brought by the 2016’s national transformation and Vision 2030 are moving Saudi Arabia quickly towards a diversified, oil-alternative economy, the country is still largely under-researched, especially with regards to franchising. If at all done, literature mostly portrays it as an importer of foreign franchises, and overlooks the development and the international growth of local franchise chains, and the factors which might encourage or hinder this growth. A qualitative, single-case, case study methodology is hereby applied to explore Kudu, a major Saudi-Arabian-born fast food service franchise chain, which was acquired in 2015 by an American investment group. The research finds that an appropriate regional legal infrastructure, and the international competitiveness of authentic, local franchise concepts, stand in favor of internationalization of Saudi franchises, while a local environment dominated by global franchise brands, and early exit decisions, might delay or hinder the process. The research has implications for local franchisors and policy makers, and recommendations for future research in this area considerably overlooked in literature.   Key Words: Franchising, Fast Food, Saudi Arabia, Internationalization Introduction Choosing the right entry mode for international expansion is a critical managerial decision and can have significant and far-reaching consequences for a firm‘s performance and survival (Shahkat Ali and Ahamat, 2018; Lu and Beamish, 2001; Bradley and Gannon, 2000). The internationalization of business in the fast-food industry is mostly done through franchising (Alnassar, 2017). While home-grown franchises have existed for more than 30 years in the Middle East (Alharbi 2014) Middle Eastern franchises across global markets have barely received attention in the literature (Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh, 2020). Saudi Arabia, the geographic context of this research, is one of the world’s top economies, and has been able to surpass many of its developing counterparts in the past half-century with respect to economic development (United Nations Development Programme, 2002). It has recently captured the interest of the world for political as well as economic reasons (Nasri and Collazzo, 2016; Welsh and Raven, 2006), and has recently acquired special further importance and attention with the recent changes which accompanied the Vision 2030, and the national transformation plan of 2016 into an economy less dependent on oil,  which incorporated major changes to the economic structure of the country (Blazquez et al, 2018; Balzquez et al, 2017; Gardner, 2017; Vision 2030, 2016). Despite these facts, the country has been so far quite under-researched at multiple levels, especially in terms of the development and the international expansion of local fast-food franchises. The purpose of this research is to mind these gaps in literature by addressing the question of how local Saudi Arabian fast-food franchises grow into international chains, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization.Review of Literature Franchising is one of the oldest forms of cooperative activities (Financial Times, 2005; Michael, 2000) and the traditional model which continues to provide products and services at a mass scale to millions of consumers worldwide (Anwar, 2011). While franchising is well-entrenched in the retail trade, Franchising has been traditionally linked to food service (Lewandowska 2014), which account for a significant share of franchise businesses, so that 40 of the top 100 global franchises in 2019 are food service related (Top100 Global Franchises Report 2019).  Researchers report that franchising has become a popular way for domestic and international expansion of firms (Rosado-Serrano & Paul, 2018), a competitive business strategy for successful expansion (Banderas et al, 2013), today’s ultimate primary means of foreign market exploitation (Petersen & Welsh, 2000), and a route for SME business expansion around the world (Keating, 1989; Sanghavi, 1998; Sadi and Henderson, 2011). Among three alternative popular methods by which businesses expand their market and distribution channels (IFA Website, Beshel, 2010), “Franchising” is the ultimate primary means of foreign market exploitation (Petersen & Welsh, 2000), the other two being “Licensing” and “Distributorship” (IFA Website, Beshel, 2010). International franchising literatures have focused on investigating why domestic firms engage in international franchising, with major reasons suggested being resource constraints, lack of foreign knowledge, and limited growth prospects (Rosado-Serrano et al, 2018). Domestic franchise market saturation was emphasized as one of the major “push” factors for international retail franchising in United States, Canada, and parts of Western Europe (Swartz, 1994; Martin, 1999; Preble & Hoffman, 2006; Alon, 2007; Olotu, 2011), where the saturation meant here is that made by a crowded market of home-grown franchisors, as opposed to saturation of the market by local franchisees of international franchise brands, as is the case with the Middle Eastern market, especially the Saudi Arabian, subject of this research.  A primary “pull” reason for internationalization of local franchises is the approach by potential franchise partners at international markets is (Welch, 1989; Doherty, 2007; Swartz, 1994, Alon, 2004; Preble & Hoffman, 2006; Olotu, 2011, Nasri and Collazzo, 2018). Other pull reasons were suggested by Hoffmann et al (2016), who examined how a country's institutional environment affects the international expansion activities of U.S. franchise companies, and suggest that favourable political governance and country's business climate of entry regulations, taxes, and communications infrastructure, are all important predictors of foreign franchise firms' expansion into that country. Their research addresses the factors prevalent in host countries, where it would be interesting to explore if and how local market, business conditions, and legal infrastructures could play a role in internationalizing local franchises.  Franchising in the Middle East is generally described in terms of foreign franchises with minimal information of local, home-grown franchises, where foreign franchises are given credit for the emergence and success of local retail food franchises in the region (Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh, 2020). The Middle East is generally recognized by Westerners as an oil-rich region, but few have a deeper understanding of the market opportunities in this region (Abbasi and Hollman, 1993; Raven & Welsh, 2004). Saudi Arabia, context of this research, is one of the top twenty economies in the world, and the largest economy in the Arab world and the Middle East, which saw fastest growth of non-oil economy, especially in 2019 (Wikipedia / Economy of Saudi Arabia, 2020). International interest keeps growing further ever since the announcement of Vision 2030’s strategic plan in 2016, which incorporated major changes to the economic structure of the country (Vision 2030, 2016; Blazquez et al, 2017), and aimed to modernize the Saudi society, and bring it more into line with the most recent world developments (Ibnmhana, 2018; Gardner, 2017; Vision 2030, 2016). With this major transformation and economic diversification, franchising emerges as a major contributor to local development in the country, where the international expansion of Middle Eastern franchises are starting to partially reverse the direction of capital flows, and lead to more revenue generation coming back into the country. Nevertheless, rarely do researchers address the internationalization of Saudi Arabian franchises (Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh, 2020), the circumstances, the successes, and the challenges associated with them, and mostly portray the country as an importer of global franchise brands, where the successes of these brands is mostly the concern of the majority of existing literature.  Research Propositions While attempting to answer the basic research question ““How do local Saudi Arabian fast-food franchises grow into international chains, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization”, literature was almost missing relevant literature.  Despite the presence known of local franchises - though very limited in number – barely did literature acknowledge the presence of franchises which were established, developed, and expanded out of Saudi Arabia. Research did refer to the fact that a few Middle Eastern franchises were competitive at international markets, especially those which reflect authentic cultures, in the case of which, however, Saudi Arabia was not addressed, except as a receptor of incoming franchise brands. Alharbi (2014) diagnosed a range of factors which face development of franchising in Saudi Arabia, where her concern was the general franchising atmosphere, including the perspective of franchisees for foreign brands, and not the birth or the internationalization of local franchise businesses. (Sadi and Hendersen, 2011) and Sadi et al (2011) referred to a few local Saudi Arabian food franchise names, not elaborating about how these local names were established or developed, and whether and how local conditions or business infrastructures supported their growth. The research by Nasri, Collazzo and Welsh (2020) was found to be the only one which studied the emergence and the competitiveness of Middle Eastern franchises at international markets, and suggested that the reflection of local cultures by Middle Eastern franchises was a competitive advantage in international markets. While cases from UAE and Lebanon were subject of their study, it would be interesting to know what process they followed, and what local and regional market conditions and/or legal systems prevailed, which enabled them to cross their home countries. Local chains of home-grown franchises did exist in Saudi Arabia, and a few attracted the attention of international investors, but they were hardly mentioned in academic research. We propose: P1-Local and regional business and legal environments contribute to internationalization of Saudi Arabian franchises.  P2- A local franchise market dominated by franchisees of global franchise chains suppresses readiness for international growth by Saudi Arabian franchisors. P3- Opportunities represented by the differentiation of indigenous, local Saudi Arabian franchises contribute to their early exit to international investors at local or regional expansion level.  Methodology 4.1.An Exploratory, Qualitative, Single Case Study Research Considering the research question “How do local Saudi Arabian franchises grow outside their home country, and whether and how local and regional franchising environments stand in favor of their internationalization” leads the researcher to follow an Exploratory Qualitative Research Methodology, as “how” questions are likely to lead to the use of case studies, histories and experiments as the preferred research method. The case study research method is “empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” (Yin 2009, p.3).  It should be mentioned that the ‘how’ question in exploratory research issues does not mean that an experiment is required to establish a direct cause and effect link between A and B (Perry et al, 1998; Perry, 2001). However, as the exploratory type of case study is used to explore those situations in which the intervention being evaluated has no clear, single set of outcomes (Baxter & Jack, 2008), the use of this methodology is justified and appropriate for the subject topic in hand.  Given the exploratory nature of the research, and provided that the researcher is addressing the study’s question in the geographic context of Saudi Arabia, which has been found to be subject of a major gap in the literature body, the research has been decided to be run on one of its most prominent fast food chains. The choice to select this case was made based on availability of local chains which crossed the Saudi Arabian border, and the incident of acquisition by the American investment group, which attracted much of the business and the franchise community interest then. One rationale for selecting a single-case rather than a multiple-case design is that the single case represents the critical test of a significant theory (Yin, 2004). A second rationale is in clinical psychology, in which a specific injury or disorder may be so rare that any single case is worth documenting and analyzing. The injury occurs so rarely that scientists have been unable to establish any common patterns (Yin, 1970, 1978). In such circumstances, the single-case study is an appropriate research. A third rationale for a single case is the representative or typical case. Here, the objective is to capture the circumstances and conditions of an everyday or commonplace situation. In these instances, researcher’s observations insights into the problem would form a significant case study because few social scientists had previously had the opportunity to investigate these problems, even though the problems were common across the country, as distinguished from the rare or unique case (Yin, 2004; Liebow, 1967).  In order to meet the quality standards required in qualitative research, trustworthiness had to be established by meeting its criteria defined by Lincoln and Guba (1985) being each of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability. Credibility, the equivalent of construct validity in quantitative research (Krostjens and Moser, 2018), has been ensured by meeting multiple strategies used for the purpose, as recommended by Lincoln and Gaba (1985). One of these strategies is the process of the triangulation of data sources. Triangulation provides multiple measures of the same phenomenon (Yin 2009, p. 116-117), and it has been well achieved, whereby interviews, used as a primary data source, were supported by documentation, archival records, physical artifacts, and direct observations (Baxter & Jack, 2008, p.554) all being secondary data sources. Interviews with the chain’s founders and top executives were conducted, using an interview guide of questions in order to further investigate their responses (McNamara,1999; Valenzuela & Shrivasta, 2002). The research followed certain set of questions derived from a case study protocol” (Merton, Fiske & Kendall, 1990; Yin, 2009, p.107). Following Yin (2003, p.45), the case study protocol will comprise an overview of the case study objectives included in a message to request the interview from prospective interviewees; field procedures; case study questions (interview guide); and a guide for the case study report. Interviews will be guided conversations rather than structured queries, meaning that the actual stream of questions in a case study interview is likely to be fluid rather than rigid, despite the  consistent line of inquiry which the researcher follows (H.J Rubin & Rubin, 1995; Yin, 2009, p.106).  Interviewed for the sake of the case study were the company’s founding executives, the company’s ex-chairman and CEO , and the company’s ex-COO. In due course, the interview guide’s set of questions was outlined in a way to address the basic research question, and to try to gather valid relevant information around the research’s propositions. 4.2.Case Description: KUDU Kudu was established in April 16, 1988 in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, which is also home of the company’s corporate head office.  It is one of 4 other restaurant concepts which is owned by a 3000-employee group holding. Kudu is a Saudi-based open kitchen concept fast food restaurant chain that serves burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches and breakfast meals.”  (www.tenyellowpages.com). With over 300 branches spread throughout the Middle East, Kudu grew to become the leading brand name in fast food, exceeding both local and international franchisees. The company also owns Aal-Khafeef, another local Arabian pizza (Manoushehconcept, with a few dozen outlets open, and is franchisee of two Lebanese restaurant chains, with several outlets and an ambitious expansion plan. The company has been featured in Forbes magazine, as one of the most recognized Middle Eastern brands, the ‘Best Sandwich’ by a leading local daily English Newspaper, and ‘The Best Food Corporation’ by the Municipality of Dubai.  The CEO has been awarded the ‘Best CEO in Saudi Arabia’ for retail and restaurants multiple times. In February 2015, private equity firms Abraaj and TPG Capital have signed a deal to purchase a majority stake in Kudu, sources aware of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. The deal was then first in the region for TPG, which manages about $65 billion of capital according to its website (www.tpg.com, 2015; www.reuters.com, 2015).  Data Analysis and Discussion 5.1.Findings around Proposition (1) P1-Building a local and regional business and legal environment contributes to internationalization of Saudi Arabian franchises.  Franchising Law & IP protection For the Saudi Arabian franchisor, venturing beyond the region came with challenges. Notably, the lack of a reliable regulatory framework leaves franchises vulnerable when it comes to the legal and intellectual protection of intangibles. Conversely, foreign jurisdictions provide ample coverage on franchising, so global players have the upper hand on shielding their resources, including intangibles. Kudu took good note of the weakness of the franchise legal infrastructure and international franchise affiliations in the region, and realized that this has put Saudi Franchise businesses at legal risk when expanding abroad by franchising. The CEO disclosed that some local entrepreneurs choose to register their brands in the USA, UK or France, and come back home as a foreign brand, so as to enjoy better regulatory protection. It was only in November 2019 that a Royal decree supported the issuance of the Franchising Law which regulates, acknowledges, and protects local Saudi Arabian franchises from their inception up to growth to expansion, and governs the enforcement of all types of franchise agreements. The law covers the protection, licencing, and registration of trademarks offered as part of the franchise agreements, all of which were governed by the laws of trade agencies.  EMCs  and Regional Franchise Treaties  Despite the fact that Kudu existed in a time when the needed local legal environment did not exist up to the hoped level, Kudu was able to expand to more than 250 branches, in Saudi Arabia and in 5 other neighbouring countries. Company executives admitted during the time of the research having had difficulties supporting their neighbouring regional franchisees in Bahrain and Kuwait from their central kitchen in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. An example of the challenges was allowing fresh food ingredients and packaging material to cross the regional borders, when the number of franchised outlets at the host market would be too small to justify investing in a new central kitchen. They suggest that regional and international free trade treaties and agreements cover inter-country common regulations which would facilitate cross-border franchise operations. A proper legal infrastructure, backed by the support of officials and policy makers, would strengthen the regional expansion of franchise brands, and grant them further exposure to international markets. “The Saudi Export Development Authority is doing a great job in promoting and supporting the export of local products, and I see this service covering the showcasing of local Saudi franchise brands and matching them with potential franchise partners across international markets.”, says an executive of the firm.  5.2.Findings around Proposition (2) P2- A local franchise market dominated by franchisees of global franchise chains suppresses readiness for international growth by Saudi Arabian franchisors Scarcity of Precedents  Company executives admit having had to create by themselves the knowledge of regional and international growth, and to pay for any mistakes from their own pockets, when the general practice and the less risky formula was to be a franchisee for a reputed global franchise which already comes from a success history. While Kudu and many Saudi born franchises succeeded in expanding to tens and hundreds of branches inside and outside of the country, the challenge imposed by the scarcity of precedents of Saudi franchisors, and the dominance and the long history of successful global franchise chains was high enough to be sometimes “frustrating and discouraging”. Kudu and their peers of local franchisors were themselves their own benchmark.Bargaining Power of Local Franchisees Prominent brands are very selective in their choice of partners. Accordingly, Kudu executives admit that “they have the upper hand in this game”. Their partners were master franchise groups who had the wealth, power, and resources to control best market locations, expand faster, market their products, partner with best suppliers, and attract a higher number of sub-franchisees, and they are well-liked by the local consumer. “Foreign Franchises are much respected here: they enjoy a presence in the local customer’s mind, and Kudu learnt a lot from them. The Middle Eastern consumer has always been impressed by foreign brands, choosing them over local ones”, says the ex-CEO. 5.3.Findings around Proposition (3) P3- Opportunities represented by the differentiation of authentic, indigenous, local Saudi Arabian franchises contribute to their early exit to international investors at local or regional expansion level.  Local billionaires – international owners The way to win the competition with global franchisees was to look for their gaps and mind them, and “we were among those who were able to differentiate by many aspects, including freshness, local touch, variety of options, and the reflection of the Saudi culture in tastes, if and where possible”. This differentiation enabled Kudu to expand, gain regional and international prominence, and attract the attention of both, master franchisee groups and international investors. Choice for them was either to keep on fighting and growing, to expand either by inviting partners or by going public, or to exit. Kudu scaled its franchising network at a remarkable pace, yet it soon became apparent that a better balance between home growth and international expansion was needed. At that point, going public emerged as a tentative way forward. However, the founding team was hesitant to give in to the increased disclosure that comes with an IPO. “We certainly wanted to avoid the challenges of fragmented ownership, dilution, and related side-effects that would jeopardize its controlling stake. And if we were to give up control, we wanted to secure a premium price an IPO can simply not guarantee”. The choice was made with a buyout proposal hard to turn down, and the deal was eventually reached, leaving the founding team with a minority “cash-cow” stake in the company, and an international new ownership of a Saudi-made franchise. Implications, Limitations and Future Research This exploratory qualitative case study calls for more attention to the local franchises grown in the Middle East in general and opens the door to explore and analyze options available for local franchises in the geographic context of the Middle East’s leading and fast-growing market, Saudi Arabia. The study stands out in a literature about the region, which, if and where available, mostly neglects the presence, the development, and the conditions around the internationalization of prominent Saudi franchise chains. The research addressed a name that represented an interesting, attractive investment opportunity for global players, and is seen by the international brands available in the Saudi market as serious competitors, like many other local franchises in the country subject of this studied. The Kudu exit transaction leaves some questions unanswered, particularly whether exiting when at the verge of global success is a wise choice for promising businesses from emerging markets. Recent evidence suggests the answer is likely ‘yes’, as Kudu’s choice was replicated in the high-profile buyouts of local online retailer Souk.com by Amazon, and ride-hailing Careem by Uber. While the decision to exit the business to a generous, tempting international buyer who could render founders quickly early billionaires, a bit of a patience, backed by local public and private support to preserve the local Saudi identity of home-grown brands, would have ended up in a global, Saudi-made and Saudi-owned brand, should the owners decide otherwise to turn the exit down, keep expanding across international markets, and enjoy the proceeds of international franchise partners. A support by local authorities and policy makers could have also, in the worst case, restrict or promote the exit of local franchises to local investors, rather than international ones, who would see a current generous offer still less costly than it would have been in the future, as the promising Saudi chain is still at its early, emerging, growth stage. While being a single case adds a challenge, yet the case was alone justified, rigorous and worth exploring, in addition to the fact that it has no similar case to compare across. It is hoped that this research will inspire future researchers to take the study to further empirical levels - especially when more cases will have come more abundant and available for study - and to check for applicability of the suggested propositions to other geographic Middle Eastern and international contexts.

The authors contributed equally. Is Further Better? What the gravity model tells us about franchising in BrazilAbstract While the gravity model was designed by researchers in retailing, few studies have used it in the wide empirical literature on franchising. Yet, it is a very relevant analytical framework (its theoretical version) and an efficient econometric tool (with the econometric version of the gravity equation) to study the determinants of flows within the space: trade flows, knowledge flows. For these reasons, it is very appropriate to study franchising, business-format franchising being based on the transmission of a business concept and methods i.e business knowledge. In this article, we study the franchise flows in Brazil, providing interesting results based on a unique new dataset.  Key words: Franchise Flows, Franchise unit spatial allocation, Brazil. This version: March 2021 Is Further Better? What the gravity model tells us about franchising in Brazil Introduction Over the years, several authors have used gravity and spatial models to explain different kind of flows between the regions, such as population, trade or patents (representing regional knowledge). In retailing literature gravity and spatial-interaction models has been often used, to explain location strategic choices. Thus, using a spatial-interaction model Gripsruda and Benito (2005) try to explain foreign market choice concerning human choice behavior. The authors provide evidence that the choice of destination is based on experience of the form and its own internationalization strategies rather than distance and market attractiveness.  Gravity model, on the other hand, from the first conceptualization of Tinbergen (1962), uses newton expression for mass explain that trade between two regions (attraction) is proportional to their size (economic power) and inversely proportional to their distance. This model, designed by academic research on retailing (see Cliquet and Sabroonchi, 2009), has also been used to empirically analyze trade between countries. According to LeSage and Thomas-Agnan (2015) a gravity model describes how the magnitude of the flows between two regions is determined by the size of the regions and the distances between them. Usually, the researchers use many characteristics of origin and destiny regions in the models. Regarding to franchising location choices, Bitti et al. (2020) based on location choices and spatial competition literature in retailing, provide evidence that the choice for agglomeration, and the location in areas with a high population and a high human development index, lead to higher chain performance in Brazil. However, the authors do not use a gravity model to study the attraction of some city of Brazil, like Sao Paulo. In this context, for the best of our knowledge no literature has explained the franchised-units allocation choice between the cities using gravity models, particularly from those in Brazil. Therefore, our purpose is to use gravity model to explain strategic geographical choices taken by the franchisor. Several recent articles highlight the relevance of studying Brazilian franchising, e.g. Grünhagen et al. (2020), Bitti et al. (2020), Lanchimba et al. (2021), Fadairo et al. (2020), Nunes et al. (2019). This article proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the hypotheses, in the framework of the theories of gravity models. Section 3 describes the data and the study variables; we use data collected from the franchise sector in Brazil. Empirical specifications using gravity model are provided in section 4. Concluding comments are offered in section 5. Theory and hypotheses Gravity models are derived from the laws of Newtonian physics. The laws of Newtonian physics are the study of massive objects. This law establish that all objects attract each other with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of distance that separates its centers.   In economics literature gravity models has been mostly used for predicting trade flows. These models try to explain attractiveness phenomena and spatial interactions.More specifically, in retailing literature Reilly (1931), Huff (1964) and Huff & Batsell (1977) are pioneers in this field. In fact, Reilly established the law of retail gravitation states, in which consumers made a trade-off between the cost of travel to a retail outlet and the attractiveness of alternative shopping opportunities.In this context, gravity models underline the importance of geographical distance. However, the authors demonstrate that the attractiveness of a retailing location, and therefore the choice to turn up in a specific location place, is not exclusively related to it. Thus, these models include other factors in the attraction concept. Then, in addition to distance related to the potential of a reginal area of local, gravity models consider other attributes as demographic weight, gross domestic product, or socioeconomic characteristics.  According to Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) the gravity model equation for N countries can be written as:    (1) Where,  is the monetary value of exports from i to j, is the word GPD, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑌 are the GDP of the countries i and j respectively,   is the cost in j of importing a good from 𝜎> 1 is the elasticity of substitution, represent exporter and importer ease of market access or country i’s outward and country j’s inward multilateral resistance terms. Based on gravity models is suggested that there are differences in location quality (Ehrmann & Meiseberg 2011; Ghosh & McLa erty 1982; Lee & McCracken 1982; Craig et al., 1984; Ghosh & McLaferty, 1987; Jones & Simmons, 1990; Simons 1992; Kelly et al., 1993; Peterson 2003; Christensen & Drejer, 2005; Park & Khan, 2006; Khan 1999; Park & Khan 2006). This literature recognizes that some location places are more profitable, or even that those places have a greater potential to be lucrative, than others. In franchising literature, Ehrmann & Meiseberg (2011) find that, location decisions of expanding franchising networks, are affected by exogenous location factors that is market perspective criteria as population density or local income, in addition with endogenous network characteristics. Hypothesis 1 (The greater the economic potential of a city, the more attractive it is for franchise flows. Hypothesis 2 ( The more distant a city, the less attractive it is for franchise flows. Data and measurement We use three distinct sources of data in our empirical analysis. The first one is the ABF's official Franchise Guide, which is an annual publication dedicated to people interested in franchise sector. This publication makes available data concerning chains' characteristics as franchise fees, total number of outlets, investment required from potential franchisees, number of employees, and so on.  Our data is for 2011, 2014 and 2016.  The second source of information was the websites of the franchise chains in our sample. We collected Zip code information from the cities occupied by the chains, as well as whether the outlets operate in some kind of shopping mall. Data collection occurred in two distinct periods: from April to July 2011 and from August to December 2014. Because of the different moment of collection between ABF yearbook and the manual capturing of website data, it is natural to notice some discrepancies. We pooled the sources of information and matched the data in order to stabilize the final dataset, and get all information necessary for our empirical analysis. Finally, we obtained a sample of 335 franchise networks. These networks occupy 1,397 Brazilian municipalities and are present in 26 states. Our third source of information is the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). We collected information about georeferencing of the occupied municipalities (longitude and latitude), GDP, population, area and the Human Development Index (HDI). We collected information from censuses undertaken by IBGE in 2000 and 2010. Municipalities HDI data are also available in the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) website for the years 2000 and 2010.  Our unique sample consists of a six-year panel, in a wide range of activities, and contains geographical information. The aforementioned bias regarding some specific segments calls for the use of sector dummies in the econometrical estimations in order to control it. 3.1.Measurement We here present the study variables used in the empirical estimations 3.1.1. Dependent variable Franchise flow: is the number of franchised units from city i to city j 3.1.2.

Empirical Strategy and Results 4.1.Methodology The econometric model (gravity equation) is expressed as follows:  𝑙𝑛𝑌 𝑙𝑛𝑌 𝑙𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑛𝑀 𝑙𝑛𝑁Where,  is the number of franchised units from i to j, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑌 are the GDP of the countries i and j respectively,   is the distance between the cities (common border), represent exporter and importer socio characteristics: unemployment and population. LeSage and Thomas-Agnan (2015) use OLS to illustrate an example of gravity model with data of census in France. For this reason, we perform OLS estimations taking into account different combinations of variables to ensure the robustness of our results. In those equations, we test for heteroscedasticity using the White's method, for multicolinearity with the variance inflation factors. However, this kind of model can raise endogeneity problems between franchised flow and GDP.We check for potential problems of endogeneity, using the instrumental variables method.  may indeed raise endogeneity problems, because they are franchised flow deriving from the attractiveness of the city (). We compare aa regular OLS model, with an instrumental model in two stages, including instruments. We consider as instrument the lack of the variable. The results show that this is good instrument, since it satisfices two conditions: it has an explanatory power with respect to the suspected endogenous variable, and it does not influence directly the outcome variable. The overidentifying test (Hansen's J: 0.115, p-value: 0.735) show that the model is overidentifying. However, we find evidence that there is a problem of endogeneity test for 2014 (χ2: 150.84, p-value: 0.00) as well as 2016  (χ2: 28.86, p-value: 0.00). 4.2.Results Our estimation results are presented in Table 3.

Second, the higher the GDP growth of the city, the more it is attractive in terms of franchise flows, which provides evidence for the first gravity hypothesis (H). Consistent with this result, we find evidence that the highest the growth rate of a town, the lowest the outgoing franchise flows.  Yet, the second gravity equation (H) does not find evidence here. Indeed, franchise flows are not larger when the transmitting and receiving cities share a border. On the contrary, our results highlight that franchise flows in Brazil are distant from the chain headquarters. Finally, our estimations on the Sao Paulo subsample underline a very specific feature of franchise flows in this State.

A third possibility in terms of this contractual mix is addressed in the present study: the multi-unit franchisees (MUF), franchisees that operate two or more units in the same chain. The literature on this issue has, almost unanimously, indicated benefits arising from the presence of MUF but, at the same time, informs too little concerning this phenomenon in emerging markets. Our study triangulates different aspects to develop and test a theoretical model related to franchisors' option for the more intense use of multi-unit franchises than traditional franchises (single-unit franchisees) or company-owned units. We applied econometric procedures to a sample with 202 networks (year-base 2018). Three theoretical aspects support a set of hypotheses regarding the characteristics that motivate a more intense MUF adoption by the networks. Specifically, the model examines the effect of agency costs, contractility of intangible assets (property rights), and local transaction costs on the proportion of MUF stores. In the applied procedure, the effects of the operationalized variables on the proportions of SUF stores and own stores are also verified, which allows comparability between the results found. These results indicate that the concentration of stores in contiguous markets, the uniformity, and the importance of maintaining the network's value proposition is associated with a greater proportion of MUF stores. It is expected to contribute to the literature on governance and control of franchise networks by addressing a phenomenon that is not so new but is still little known in structuring these networks. Key words: multi-unit franchises, agency theory, property rights, asset specificity, governance of franchised networks. INTRODUCTION Recently, a particular topic has attracted attention in the franchising literature: multi-unit franchises (MUFs). In this type of arrangement, a single franchisee can operate more than one unit, sometimes reaching hundreds of units. According to Boulay, Caemmerer, Evanschitzky and Duniach (2016), about 40% of franchisees in the USA's 50 largest chains are MUFs. In short, multi-unit franchise arrangements represent a widespread and dominant pattern of structuring franchise networks in many sectors (Dant, Weaven, Baker, & Jeon, 2013). For decades, MUFs have been avoided in the literature despite being an old practice, as indicated in studies like Zeller, Achabal and Brown (1980). One explanation the difficulty in accessing data related to this kind of franchising arrangement (Bradach, 1995). However, Garg and Rasheed (2003), in a provocative statement, proposed that the status of multi-unit franchisees as an \"anomaly,\" a term used by Kaufmann and Dant (1996) to describe MUFs, seemed to be more attributable to the lack of a focused and comprehensive theoretical attempt to explain the phenomenon than due to any inadequacy of agency theory - one of the most traditional approaches to the examination of franchising. The success of this arrangement calls into question some traditional theoretical predictions. For example, agency theory proposes that franchisees tend to have a higher level of effort and dedication to their outlets than salaried employees, since ownership enhances incentives to effort. However, as more units in the chain are assigned to the same franchisee, there is a need for her/him to hire employees to manage the units, so that problems related to incentives tend to occur. But the MUF phenomenon in franchise chains worldwide suggests there are benefits derived from their use (Bodey, Weaven & Grace, 2011). Such benefits should outweigh any agency costs related to problems with incentives. The literature indicates that MUFs represent more abundant sources of funds than traditional single-unit franchisees (SUFs). These resources can be material ones, such as the capital invested in various units and the local infrastructure needed to manage them (Hussain & Windsperger, 2010, 2013), but they can also be of an intangible tacit nature, such as the level of knowledge, no longer restricted to a single location, but to the region. Besides this, to the extent that these franchisees manage a business with several units, they are motivated to follow the operational standards of the brand, focusing on more strategic aspects of the business, which strongly contributes to aspects of consistency and preservation of the brand value (Hussain, Sreckovic, & Windsperger, 2018). There are also indications that by spreading investments in more units, franchisees’ risks are diluted and better allocated, reducing the expected return that could not be realized, and achieving fairer margins from a single unit (Dant et al., 2013). Among the gaps still present in knowledge regarding MUFs, one particularly motivates the present study: little is known about this type of franchising in emerging markets (one exception is Lima, 2019). Given the greater contractual complexity, we expect that possible institutional weaknesses and political-economic instability will make this type of environment different from the markets generally explored by the literature. This means gaps in knowledge both in theoretical and practical terms. In the Brazilian case, the scenario is even more intriguing, given that the country is struggling to recover from a strong economic recession that started in 2014. Thus, this paper aims to shed light on how the proportion of MUF relates to characteristics of franchised chains, such as spatial dispersion, royalties, and specific and intangible assets We triangulate three theoretical lenses to compose a model predicting the proportion of stores belonging to MUF. From agency theory, we examine attributes related to outlets’ spatial positioning and the assumed effect on monitoring costs and incentives according to agency theory. The relative importance of systemic (franchisor) and local (franchisee) intangible assets is derived from property-rights theory. Finally, the role of asset specificity is extracted from transaction cost economics. Thus, the three strands shape the conceptual basis for developing the set of hypotheses that constitute the model of analysis, which are tested using a sample containing 202 franchise chains associated with the Brazilian Franchising Association (ABF). The sample consists of data from 2018. Although the analysis emphasizes the proportion of MUF outlets, our econometric models also treat as dependent variables the proportion of company-owned outlets and the proportion of outlets pertaining to SUF (single-unit franchisees). In doing so, the analysis is enriched by the comparability between modes. The results indicate that aspects such as contiguity of markets (proximity and similarity), uniformity, protection and preservation of the brand's value proposal seem to be related to the greater presence of MUFs in our sample. Conversely, when franchisee's intangible assets are more important in the franchisor's assessment, the MUF outlet proportion is lower, confirming the property-rights view's predictions. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES 2.1.Agency Theory Agency theory explains franchising as a response to vertical problems like shirking (Mathewson & Winter, 1985). The allocation of ownership of the unit to the local agent aims to enhance incentives to her/his effort to obtain income/wealth from the unit's performance. In return, the agent (the franchisee) pays fees and acquires inputs from the franchisor. Thus, the classic hypothesis is that a higher level of geographic dispersion of a chain’s units increases monitoring costs and induces the chain manager to operate with more franchised units. In MUF arrangements, the store managers’ status as employees appears again, and following the rationale of this aspect, the strength of the current incentives would be reduced (Bradach, 1995). However, it is assumed that a MUF has closer physical proximity to its units than the franchisor (Garg, Rasheed, & Priem, 2005). Thus, concerning the agent's effort, the level of information asymmetry tends to be mitigated both by the physical proximity and by the greater local knowledge of the multi-unit franchisee. However, if the chain deals with a level of total dispersion that exceeds the monitoring capacity of even the closest multi-unit franchisees, the comparative advantage of MUFs would be reduced to the point where it is more advantageous to operate with more SUFs. Therefore, geographic dispersion is expected to be associated with a greater franchised proportion, but if the dispersion level rises too much, more SUFs are expected. Formally, we have:  Higher levels of geographic dispersion will be positively associated with the proportion of franchised outlets, but this relationship will be less strong with MUFs. The franchised arrangement does not eliminate opportunities for undesired action by agents. When operating under a shared brand, franchisees may be tempted to save inputs and efforts while charging prices and margins typical of the chain. Hence, this saving permits benefits in the short term, while sharing with other players the loss of reputation (and future revenues) resulting from the worse quality in the long run. The free riding effect (Combs, Michael, & Castrogiovanni, 2004) damages the network's reputation and the brand value. One way of dealing with this problem is for the franchisor to increase monitoring, but that would run counter to the franchise's raison d'être. Lower royalties could serve as horizontal incentives because this condition allocates a larger fraction of the unit’s residual income. This is particularly interesting if the franchised chain’s brand is still a developing asset (Lafontaine, 1992). However, MUFs can help franchisors to charge higher royalties. First, MUFs have more opportunities to increase earnings through potential economies of scale. This happens because MUFs can dilute fixed costs in more units (Garg, Priem, & Rasheed, 2013). Also, the risk of free riding is reduced since MUFs will absorb part of negative externalities resulting from reduced quality, for instance. Moreover, because MUFs have more than one outlet (and proportionally more to lose), they can involve themselves in horizontal monitoring activities in order mitigate losses due to free riding of other chains’ franchisees. In short, we propose that:  The relationship between the royalties and the proportion of MUF outlets is positive. The second aspect of horizontal problems is the relationship between MUFs, and the contiguity of markets (location) of the units. Contiguous markets are defined here as close locations, both in distance and socioeconomic aspects. According to Garg et al. (2005), the positioning of various outlets of a single franchisee in nearby markets encourages the emergence of a “motivated monitor”, given that this agent has a residual claim on such units. Multi-unit franchise arrangements make the franchisor more likely to shift residual incentives to the agent at a higher level in the network’s governance, i.e., from the local to the regional level. From the franchisor's point of view, any lost resulting from inefficiencies related to local incentives would be more than offset by gains in the units' performance due to the action of the “monitor” (MUF). Previous studies have indicated that MUFs operate clusters of contiguous stores, which generates more monitoring efficiency and scale returns, for example, in logistics costs, staff management and administrative structure, among others (Grünhagen & Mittelstaedt, 2002; Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004; Perryman & Combs, 2012). Even so, it is beneficial for clusters of outlets to belong to the same player, whether a MUF or the franchisor itself (Kalnins & Lafontaine, 2004). The prevalence of MUF outlets is a result of the combined effect of incentives to the agent (now a regional one) and the fact that she/he has more strategic resources and capabilities. Therefore:  The concentration of stores in contiguous markets will be positively associated with the proportion of MUF stores. The division of a country into smaller autonomous territorial entities, such as states or provinces, can affect the similarity or distinction between locations where a chain operates (Klick, Kobayashi, & Ribstein, 2012). In some countries, like the USA, Mexico and Germany, states have a high degree of autonomy, even having their own legislation. In contrast, in Brazil, the 26 states and the Federal District (Brasilia) are under the same corporate, intellectual property, labor and antitrust legislation, which does not prevent the existence of substantial differences in terms of sociodemographic, tax and logistical characteristics. The operation of a chain in different states exposes the franchisor to a dispersion scenario that includes physical distance and different contexts (Lafontaine & Shaw, 2005). Therefore, monitoring is more difficult while franchisees’ local knowledge grows in importance. As we said before, the term “local” gains another connotation: it is not a specific location, but a region or even an entire state. This raises the required level of knowledge about the environment. Once again, the “motivated monitor” character appears, as mentioned above. Thus, the following hypothesis is stated:  The chain's presence in many states will be positively associated with the proportion of MUF stores. 2.2.Property Rights The level of contractibility of intangible assets important for the generation of residual gains has a strong influence on a company's ownership structure (Hart & Moore, 1990; Hart, 2003). The degree of contractility has to do with contractual parties' ability to specify attributes, encode and transfer property rights to such assets between each other (Windsperger & Dant, 2006; Hussain & Windsperger, 2010). Systemic network assets (such as the brand) and specific local assets (such as the franchisee's local knowledge) are examples of intangible assets with low contractibility. The relative importance among them - which most contributes to the generation of residual gains for the chain - will be decisive for allocating residual and property rights over units (Windsperger & Dant, 2006). If contractable systemic assets are more important, the franchisor retains more decision and income rights, and a smaller proportion of franchised units is expected, and vice versa (Perryman & Combs, 2012). According to Hussain, Perrigot, Mignonac, Akremi, and Herrbach (2013), in the presence of important intangible assets of the franchisor, the risk of free riding increases, a priori encouraging the chains to use more own stores. However, since MUFs are required to make more specific investments depending on the various units, a bonding effect would be established, discouraging inappropriate behavior, and making the MUF option more attractive. On the other hand, if strictly local intangible assets are more important, the SUF alternative will prevail, since decision rights tend to be allocated to local owners to encourage them to continue investing in such assets. It is expected that if franchisors' perception of the relative importance of local intangible assets is high, SUFs will be prevalent in relation to MUF stores. Formally: The greater the relative importance of the franchisee's local assets, the lower the MUF store proportion will be. Franchising and standardization/control are almost synonymous in terms of achieving system-wide efficiencies and consistency of the brand image (Garg et al., 2005; Meiseberg, 2013). Standardized products benefit the franchising system through image uniformity, quality control, and cost minimization (Kaufmann & Eroglu, 1999). Standardization implies the development of routines that are consistently applied and obeyed to minimize variability in operations (Dada, Watson, & Kirby, 2012). However, franchisees may have private incentives to deviate from such standards (Sorenson & Sørensen, 2001). As a matter of perception, the individual may not be able to achieve sustainable benefits from operating under a strong brand and may make decisions that are out of step with the routines indicated by chain management, aiming at short-term benefits in detriment of the established standards (Dickey, Harrison McKnight, & George, 2007). The risk of inappropriate behavior (free riding) could motivate franchisors to establish standards and routines to improve control. However, the emphasis on standardization can inhibit adaptive responses from local managers to changes in the immediate environment (Cox & Mason, 2007; Pizanti & Lerner, 2003; Dada et al., 2012). Local demographic, economic, or competitive changes may require answers that would not be given if the level of standardization excessively stresses local agents' performance. In other words, the rigidity of controls to mitigate risks of inappropriate behavior would inhibit the ability to respond locally (Hussain & Windsperger, 2013). The MUF literature proposes the coexistence of company-owned and franchised outlet as a strategy to reach both standardization and local adaptive skills (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Meiseberg, 2013). Something similar is proposed by the resource-based view, for which the contractual mix permits franchisors to acquire new knowledge (exploration) and disseminate the use of this knowledge (exploitation) within the chain (Sorenson & Sørensen, 2001). The concept of the contractual mix can be expanded to consider the MUF alternative. MUFs combine resources from owned and franchised stores (SUFs). For example, MUFs are more likely to replicate franchisor practices and routines (Kaufmann & Dant, 1996; Bradach, 1997) because by doing so they can focus on managerial and strategic issues related to their “mini-chains” (Garg et al., 2005; Hussain et al., 2018). In particular, the uniformity of key characteristics (service level, for instance) can affect consumers' perception of the organization, brand image, and reputation. If these aspects vary between units, the brand can be weakened, as well as its market positioning. Our study proposes that if uniformity is a strategic driver prioritized by the franchisor, a positive relationship between such priority and the proportion of MUF stores will be found. Formally: A greater emphasis on operational standardization will be associated with a greater proportion of MUF stores.Monitoring practices aiming to maintain desired standards can take different forms, varying according to the area of operation of the network, the level of experience with the process/product, and the format of its contractual mix (Bradach, 1997; Pizanti & Lerner, 2003). Examples of these practices are inventory turnover control (in the case of retail chains), financial auditing, and field consulting / monitoring. Operational aspects such as health and safety standards, quality of the final product, store layout, and standardization are identified as focal points for face-to-face monitoring of many networks operating in the USA (Cox & Mason, 2007). Cliquet and Groisjean (2002) indicated that some franchisors could reduce the number of company-owned outlets by increasing the number of field auditors, whereas previously such franchisors strategically positioned their units in some locations to evaluate both the market and the franchisee performance. Considering that the maintenance of certain levels of standardization and uniformity is related to the maintenance of the brand value proposal, it is reasonable to expect such interactions, manifested by the presence of the intense use of field auditing, to reflect the network's priority given to such aspects. As a result, a positive – albeit indirect – relationship between the use of field monitors and a greater proportion of MUF stores is expected. Thus: The intensity of field monitoring will be positively associated with the proportion of MUF stores. 2.3.Transaction Costs Franchisees typically make specific investments, which give room for quasi-rents to appear (Vázquez, 2008). According to Perryman and Combs (2012), the risk of expropriation of franchises’ quasi-rents by franchisors would increase the proportion of company-owned outlets because of a lower demand for the brand. To circumvent this problem, franchisors could offer longer contracts to franchisees to protect specific assets developed by the latter during the operation of their units (Vázquez, 2008). However, many franchisors avoid this alternative due to the risk of free riding. This is a paradox, since the increase in the required investment would affect both demand for and supply of new franchises. MUF arrangements can be useful to solve this dilemma. MUFs make larger investments in absolute terms, but they can spread this investment to more than one unit, and they can also benefit from scale, as already mentioned. Such diversification mitigates part of the investment risk. Franchisees with more units also tend to have greater bargaining power, reducing space for the franchisor's opportunistic behavior (Boulay et al., 2016). On the other hand, from the franchisor's point of view, higher exit barriers are expected with greater numbers of units a franchisee has, which can contribute to reducing litigation (BERCOVITZ, 2004). Thus, one can expect a reduction in transaction costs. In short, we expect that the greater the specific investments demanded from franchisees, the greater the proportion of MUFs in the network will tend to be. Formally:  The higher the investment in specific local assets, the greater will be the proportion of MUF stores.METHODOLOGY Figure 1 presents schematically the model and summarizes the set of hypotheses. Solid lines represent expected positive relationships, and dashed lines represent expected negative ones (in this case, only H2a). The model includes control variables for the industry nature (retail or service), size, and maturity. The proper explanation for its use will be presented later in the text. The first source of information was the ABF Official Franchise Guide in base-year 2018. However, information pertinent to the proportion of outlets belonging to multi-unit franchisees is not included in this publication. Therefore, it was necessary to develop an instrument to collect data related to the proportion of MUF outlets and other variables present in the model. We opted for the development of a self-administered questionnaire following research strategies previously adopted in the literature in multi-unit franchises, such as Hussain et al. (2018), Boulay et al. (2016) and Grissmair et al. (2014), among others. All 963 associated networks received the questionnaires, and 215 responses were obtained, of which only 202 responses could be considered valid. The third source of data for the study was the web pages of the networks that answered the questionnaire satisfactorily. The main data collected here were the addresses of the units of our sample. This collection took place between April and May 2018. Finally, it was necessary to access data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) to obtain information such as latitude and longitude of Brazilian municipalities. We also emphase that in some cases conflicting information was observed in some franchisors' responses. For example, in the Official Franchise Guide, chains report the number of company-owned and franchised outlets. Then, the number of outlets is available. Sometimes these numbers were discrepant in relation to the number of outlets informed by chains at their websites. When this fact was noticed, we either asked the ABF itself to resolve the doubt or contacted the franchisor for clarification. Figure 1 - Theoretical Model3.1.Variables and analysis method We tested the proportion of MUFs’ outlets (PMUF), SUFs’ outlets (PSUF) and company-owned outlets (PCO) as dependent variables in three models: an ordinary least squares (OLS) model, logistic regression with fractional response, and a Tobit model (0 and 1 censored). This allowed certifying the consistency of the estimators in different econometric models. OLS regression has the advantage of simplicity of its estimation, but it has the disadvantage of predicting values less than zero and greater than one. The logistic estimation method (logit) was applied to correct this disadvantage. It considers a binary response model for the dependent variable, adjusting its estimation between zero and one (Wooldridge, 2002). However, although it is useful to evaluate the consistency of the results (and the applied OLS), a not insignificant part of the sample is concentrated in values equal to 0. Thus, a Tobit model was applied because it deals better with problems of corner selection; that is, several observations in the sample having y = 0 (there are no MUF stores in the chain), and the rest are continuously distributed along with positive values (Wooldridge, 2002, p. 538). The logit and Tobit models' estimation were performed using the ‘fracreg’ function proposed by Papke and Wooldridge (1996), recommended for dependent variables limited and fractioned between zero and one (Papke &Wooldridge, 1996, 2008). 3.2.Independent variables GEODISP seeks to capture the effect of the units' geographical dispersion among themselves and the franchisor. We used data from the municipalities where our sample’s chains have outlets. These data are available at the networks' internet pages. Euclidean distances were applied to the latitude and longitude of these cities. We assumed that networks with concentrated units are more easily monitored than networks with units more spread over the Brazilian territory. Thus, cluster analysis was applied to define groups of units that each network presents to consider the distance between the groups and not just the distance between units. Finally, the variable was created by adding, for each chain, the Euclidean distance between the stores of each group and the Euclidean distance of the groups. Larger values are associated with more dispersed networks. ROYALTIES are represented by the percentage of gross revenue that chains charge franchisees. This operationalization follows previous studies that have investigated the behavior of franchise rates, such as Wimmer and Garen (1997), Maruyama and Yamashita (2012), and Vásquez (2005). The contiguity effect of markets is operated with two variables. The first one considers the average number of outlets per city () of the chains. Our perception is that different units of the same chain operating in the same city tend to deal with a high contiguity level. The OPC variable involves dividing the total units by the total number of cities where chains are present. The second variable related to contiguity - STATES - considers the number of Brazilian states in which the network has operations. The next three variables are used based on the assumptions derived from the property rights view. The first one - LOCAL-ASSET - seeks to capture the franchisor's perception of local assets’ relative importance. The operationalization of this variable considers franchisors' responses to the questionnaire. In this case, a five-point Likert question was sent to franchisors: “the franchisee's local assets (such as knowledge of the local market, the business, etc.) are more important than the network's value proposition than system assets (brand, business format update, etc.).” The variable UNIFORMITY also seeks to capture the construct through responses to the questionnaire. However, to operationalize the franchisor's assignment of importance of uniformity to the network’s success, principal component analysis was employed to reduce three questions into one. In this case, using a five-point Likert scale, the importance of uniformity in terms of (i) the opening period of the store/unit, (ii) the level of service practiced, and (iii) price/margin practiced by the franchisee. However, this operationalization imposes some limitations on our results, considering that the extracted factor explained only 46.79% of the total variance and the low Cronbach’s alpha obtained in the reliability test (0.479). FIELD AUDIT seeks to capture consultancy and field auditing to maintain the desired level of uniformity. The variable allows testing the hypothesis . Here, too, a direct question with a five-point Likert scale was presented to the franchisors: \"our network makes intense use of a field consultants as a way of maintaining the standards required of our franchisees.\" Furthermore, the model is inspired by the transaction cost savings and considers the effect of specific assets on the networks’ contractual mix. We use a single variable: INITIAL-INVESTMENT. This is the outlay reported by the network to open an outlet. These data are available in the ABF Official Franchise Guide, being informed, in most cases, between a maximum and minimum investment amount. To reduce the bias of assuming that the data’s average would approximate reality, we decided to take the minimum values. Therefore, there is a lower limit for store size related to the business's particular characteristics. Our model contains three control variables. The first one – RETAIL – is a dichotomous variable to indicate whether the chain's business model is aimed at retailing (0) or services (1). This variable allows controlling the differences in terms of capacity for remote monitoring. The attributes of the products sold by retail stores are typically more objective when compared to the service sector. Besides, profit margins on input prices tend to be tighter in retailing, causing the need to allocate more stores to the same franchisee to allow them greater opportunities for gain. Also, we included two variables to capture differences in terms of network maturity and size. The first considers the period (in years) that the chain has adopted the franchise model. The second is the product between the total number of units and the average gross revenue per unit reported in the ABF Official Franchise Guide. RESULTS Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the variables used in the study. The differences in the magnitude of the different scales indicated the need to standardize continuous variables. Another important aspect of Table 1 is the absence of the UNIFORMITY variable. As explained, this variable was obtained by extracting a common factor from three responses given by the franchisors regarding the perceived importance of maintaining standards regarding (i) store opening times, (ii) prices and margins practiced by franchisees, and (iii) level of service offered. The extracted factor is a standardized variable, so it would have little to report in the Table 1. Therefore, we chose to report the original variables on which the models' variable was constituted.

Table 2 shows the significant Pearson correlations at 5%. Some higher correlations (above 40%) stand out and demand explanation. For example, the proportion of owned stores (PERC-LP) has a stronger negative correlation with the proportion of franchised stores: SUFs (-51.67%) and MUFs (-62.77%), which is natural (the more own stores, the fewer franchised stores, and vice versa). However, the variables SIZE and MATURITY have some high correlations, both between each other and with the variables related to the networks' dispersion, which confirms the need to use them as control variables. Naturally, larger and longer-lived networks will tend to be spread over a larger area. All other correlations are moderate to insignificant. Even so, to verify multicollinearity problems between variables in the OLS method, we applied variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis and found no multicollinearity problems.

Before the estimations of the model of this first stage, we applied basic tests to validate the econometric assumptions, among them: Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test, to investigate issues of residual homoscedasticity and the variance inflation factor test (VIF), to analyze the assumption of regarding multicollinearity Table 3 – Results of econometric models Dependent Variable PCO PSUF PMUF OLS LOGIT (fracreg) TOBIT (fracreg) OLS LOGIT (fracreg) TOBIT (fracreg) OLS LOGIT (fracreg) TOBIT (fracreg) GEODISP 0.05*** 0.39* 0.08*** -0.05 -0.19 -0.03 -0.00 0.00 0.01 ROYALTIES -0.02 0.22 0.05 -0.05 -0.02 -0.01 0.05 0.14 -0.01 OPC -0.03*** -0.25** -0.03*** -0.02 -0.01 -0.02 0.05*** 0.24*** 0.06*** STATES -0.08*** -0.68*** -0.09*** -0.01 -0.05 -0.01 0.09*** 0.45*** 0.12*** LOCAL ASSETS 0.01 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.09 0.02 -0.02* -0.13** -0.03** UNIFORMITY 0.01 0.09 0.03 -0.02 -0.09 -0.02 0.03* 0.15* 0.03* FIELD AUDIT 0.00 0.03 0.01 -0.04** -0.14** -0.03* 0.03** 0.18** 0.04** INITIAL INVEST 0.05*** 0.40*** 0.07*** -0.08*** -0.54*** -0.13*** 0.03 0.13 0.03 RETAIL 0.06* 0.47** 0.07* -0.14*** -0.55*** -0.13*** 0.09*** 0.48*** 0.10** SIZE 0.02 0.05 -0.01 0.01 -0.06 -0.02 -0.03 -0.19 -0.05 MATURITY -0.03** -0.37* -0.05** 0.00 0.04 0.01 0.02 0.14* 0.04** 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 202 0.26 0,23 0,29 F-statistic 107.56 159.61 5,17 59,42 9,05 9,51 731.73 69,46 85,13 Ramsey test (1969): Test statistic 1.71 1.53 1.16 Probability > F 0.17 0.21 0.33 * Significant at 10%; ** Significant at 5%; *** Significant at 1%.

The test did not indicate potential problems of omitting a relevant variable. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS The most surprising result is the rejection of . Our results indicate an unexpected positive and significant sign between the level of geographical dispersion and which contradicts decades of research in franchising. There is no significant relationship between geographic dispersion and SUF- or MUF-proportion in our sample. One possible explanation is the severe recession that Brazil experienced between 2014 and 2017 and whose effects have not yet completely dissipated as of this writing. Brazilian GDP is still far from recovering from the historic high of 2008 (source: World Bank). Considering that, as mentioned above, recent studies in Brazil have indicated discrepant results, the positive relationship between geographic dispersion and more company-owned outlets may indicate the closing of franchised units and/or repurchasing of the former franchised units by franchisors.  predicts a negative relationship between ROYALTIES and the proportion of MUF stores. This hypothesis was not supported. There is no evidence that networks with more MUFs charge higher royalties. ROYALTIES is not significant in any alternative of the analyzed contract mix, which indicates that this is not an attribute related to governance and instead is more associated with pricing and compensation (Polo-Redondo, Bordonaba-Juste, & Palacios, 2011). However, the results contradict the tradition of agency theory that proposes the adjustment of royalty rates as incentive mechanisms for franchisees (Pénard, Raynaud, & Saussier, 2003; Chen, Wang, & Yang, 2015). Incentives and monitoring are at the heart of the “agency” discussion related to franchising. Similarly, the data indicate a disconnect between geographic dispersion and the franchised proportion, an aspect related to monitoring costs. This imbalance also indicates the absence of influence of incentives on the arrangement.  received partial support. Although we found a positive relationship between the contiguity of markets and the proportion of MUF outlets, we also expected to see the same in the case of company-owned outlets, as in Kalnins and Lafontaine (2004), which did not happen. This result, in a sense, relates to what we found in  If greater geographic dispersion appears to be positively associated with more company-owned outlets, the opposite seems to be true since the  variable captures concentration of units. Although the negative sign for the SUF percentage is not significant, it corroborates our interpretation.  proposes that the presence in more states in Brazil will be associated with more MUFs, and to a lesser extent, also with more company-owned outlets. We found similar results as those for  in terms of signs and significance (although both are negatively correlated, as shown in Table 2). The presence in many states leads to increased monitoring costs, but also involves consideration of the contiguity of markets and leads to a greater franchisor dependence on franchisees’ local knowledge. By allocating several outlets to the same agent, the franchisor allows it to benefit from gains in scale that result in part from local market knowledge. The (partial) support for  appears to be evidence of this - MUFs become an alternative precisely because they demand fewer resources to monitor.  receives considerable support. It proposes that the greater importance given by franchisors to local intangible assets (beyond local knowledge) is associated with a lower proportion of MUFs in the contractual mix. Moreover, the sign is positive for SUF-proportion, although not significant. The results also support previous works such as Hussain and Windsperger (2010, 2011, 2013), which indicate that the presence of local intangible assets important for the generation of residual rents impacts the allocation of decision/property rights in franchised networks. If these assets grow in importance, becoming essential for the unit's success, the franchisor tends to adopt less intense arrangements in terms of control (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014), so that SUF arrangements prevail. Also, we interpret that MUF arrangements imply a large amount of these types of assets accumulated in some agents' hands, which would leave the franchisor exposed to greater franchisee bargaining power.  suggests a greater proportion of MUFs if the franchisor prioritizes uniformity in local processes. The data supported this hypothesis. The estimator is negative, although not significant, for the PSUF, while it is positive and significant for the MUF-proportion. Moreover, the support obtained by  (the third hypothesis related to property rights) reinforces the result for the relationship between uniformity and the MUF alternative. This hypothesis proposes that field auditing/consulting to monitor and direct the level of uniformity in the different units is associated with a higher proportion of MUFs. In fact, the relationship between the intensity of use of this device has a negative and significant association with the proportion of SUF outlets. In contrast, it is positive and significantly associated with the proportion of MUF stores.  proposes that greater local specific investments will be associated with a greater proportion of MUFs. The data do not support this hypothesis. The estimator is positive and significant for the proportion of company-owned outlets, while it is negative and significant for SUF-proportion. Despite the positive sign, the estimator is not significant for the proportion of MUF stores. These results regarding the specificity of assets also go against previous research (Hussain & Windsperger, 2010, 2011; Hussain et al., 2013; Hussain et al., 2018). Considering that these studies cover markets with a lower level of environmental uncertainty (France, Austria, Switzerland and Germany), a possible explanation for the present results is a higher level of vertical integration due to the instability of the Brazilian institutional environment, especially considering the political and economic disturbances seen in recent years. Additionally, we realize that the operationalization of the INITIAL_INVEST variable, although inspired by previous studies, may not be able to capture the effect of asset specificity in isolation. In the same way that geographic dispersion (GEODISP) appears positively related to more company-owned outlets, the Brazilian economic situation may have reduced the number of potential franchisees with the necessary resources to open stores. Regarding the control variables, RETAIL presents a positive and significant sign concerning both MUF- and company-owned outlets. In contrast, the sign is opposite (maintaining significance) for the SUF-proportion. When comparing company-owned and MUF outlets, the magnitude of the estimators found for the MUF-proportion is consistently higher across the three models. We realize that the results involve with both property rights and agency theories. In the first case, retail chains tend to deal with lower monitoring costs than in the service sector since units' performance evaluation relies on more objective measures, such as inventory turnover. As a result, the demand for local managers' incentive mechanisms can be less, allowing the network (or MUFs) to retain more residual rents from their units. This reasoning can be extended to issues related to local assets' contractibility; an aspect discussed within the scope of property rights theory. Given the characteristic tangibility of operations with goods, a lower allocation of decision rights to the local agent by the network management would be expected, given the greater ability to measure more objectively the local manager's contribution to the success of the operation. Although SIZE is not significant, MATURITY showed a negative and significant relationship with the proportion of company-owned outlets, which has been verified in previous studies in Brazil (Davidovitsch, Caldas, & Silva, 2009) and abroad (Castrogiovanni, Combs, & Justis, 2006; Shane, Shankar, & Aravindakshan, 2006). Although the positive relationship between the system's maturity and the proportion of franchised outlets is not unanimous (for example, in Alon, (2001), the results are in line with most traditional theories applied to franchising studies. Although pioneering studies based on the resource scarcity view expected the franchised proportion to drop as the network became more mature - indicating a negative quadratic pattern (U-shape) - Castrogiovanni et al. (2006) identified a cubic pattern in this relationship, explained by the observation that scarce resources would impact the network much more in the initial years of its operation, while coordination (or agency) costs would start to affect the network as its brand and value proposition consolidated over time. FINAL COMMENTS This study sheds light on the presence of multi-unit franchisees in Brazilian chains. While the geographical dispersion of units does not seem to be a relevant factor in the current scenario, the presence in a greater diversity of scenarios (approximated by the number of Brazilian states) appears to be related to a greater proportion of MUF outlets. In fact, the issue of geographic dispersion is not related to the franchised proportion in general, suggesting that franchisors have been closing or repurchasing franchised units, perhaps a consequence of the Brazilian recession. Two factors strongly associated with MUFs were the location of units in contiguous markets and a greater emphasis on standardization and uniformity. On the other hand, a smaller proportion of MUF outlets was found when the franchisor realize that local intangible resources are decisive for units’ success. In such cases, franchisors appear to be allocating ownership of the assets and the residual operation to the local (and not regional) owner. We believe there are three main theoretical contributions of this study. First, it provides evidence that vertical agency issues (the decision to make the agent a residual claimant) may become secondary in economic instability scenarios. In adjusting governance in such scenarios, the franchisor may choose to take over its stores' operation and not lose markets. The monitoring of this trend over time, including after recovery from the Brazilian recession, may shed more light on this dynamic. The second theoretical contribution is in the conceptual scope of the developed model. The model triangulates three theoretical strands - agency theory, property rights theory, and transaction cost savings - and still maintains a “dialog” with the resource-based view. By detecting the loss of connection between geographic dispersion and franchise proportion, the model brings to the debate a vision of scarce resources. Similarly, when considering the emphasis on uniformity and intensity of field monitoring, aspects of knowledge transmission discussed within the resource-based view are considered. Furthermore, by triangulating different data sources, aspects of validity are strengthened, increasing the results' robustness. Finally, the third theoretical contribution is to bring to emerging markets such as Brazil a discussion so far restricted to more mature and consolidated markets such as the USA, European Union and Australia. In addition to the well-known institutional weaknesses, as mentioned several times, Brazil is still experiencing the consequences of a strong economic recession that affected the franchising sector. ABF data indicate that, for the first time in history, the number of franchise chains dropped (by almost 7%) between 2016 and 2017 (in terms of revenue, the decline was approximately 10%). A further theoretical step would be to measure the relationship between MUFs and network performance. However, some limitations suggest caution regarding the interpretation of the results. One is the cross-sectional nature of the study. These studies fail to capture causality, so this attribute is solely dependent on theory. As a result, the level of internal validity achieved is not high, requiring further research efforts to develop longitudinal studies or field studies to obtain historical data. Another is the operationalization of some variables that demand more sophistication. For example, the construct validity of the variable used to capture specific local assets (investment to open a new store) may capture other effects such as scarcity of resources. Future studies related to this topic could contribute to the improvement of these measures.

Combining individual-level and dyad-level data from 120 franchisor-franchisee relationships within a franchise network, we test how two contextual conditions (i.e. the franchisor’s trust in a franchisee and the franchisor’s network control) moderate the impact of franchisee economic outcomes (i.e. economic satisfaction) and social outcomes (i.e. trust in the franchisor and trust in peers) on their network exit intentions and subsequent exit behaviors. As predicted by Social Exchange Theory (SET), the franchisor’s trust in franchisee is beneficial for maintaining exchange relationships; economic satisfaction only reduces franchisee exit intentions when franchisor’s trust in franchisee is high. Contrary to SET, high franchisor’s trust in franchisee has only marginal value for the franchisee when the franchisee already trusts the franchisor. Next, a high franchisor’s network control weakens the negative (network-stabilizing) effect of economic satisfaction on franchisees’ exit intentions, and strengthens the positive, (network-destabilizing) effect of franchisees’ trust in peers on their network exit intentions. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the promoting and undermining roles of franchisor’s trust and network control for the management of franchisee network exit intentions.Keywords: control;network exits; social exchange; trust; direct and generalized exchanges.INTRODUCTION Effective cooperation in franchise networks requires coordination of resources and actions of partners with mixed motives. Many studies have therefore focused on franchise relationship issues, such as trust, conflicts, compliance (Grünhagen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). Yet, relatively few studies have addressed the reasons why franchisees intend to leave their franchise networks (exceptions are Morrison, 1997; Frazer & Winzar, 2005; Mignonac et al., 2015: López-Fernández & López-Bayon, 2018). This relative lack of theoretical understanding is surprising, given the serious consequences of franchisee network exits. Our study increases the understanding of why and under what contextual conditions franchisees leave their networks.  We adopt Social Exchange Theory (SET) by arguing that franchise networks uniquely combine contractual direct exchanges between the franchisor (as the network leader) and individual franchisees with generalized exchanges among the franchisees, resulting in a unique trust-control interplay that affects franchisee behaviors. Most SET studies focus on direct reciprocity in dyadic exchanges, such as leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships (e.g., Bagger & Li, 2014), or alliance relationships (e.g., Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). However, in franchise networks, franchisees are also in a generalized exchange with their peers (i.e. franchisees in the same network) and thus face generalized reciprocity; that is quid pro quo exchanges within the group but not necessarily with any specific franchisee (cf. Das & Teng, 2002a; Heidl et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet examined how outcomes derived from direct and generalized exchanges influence franchisees’ tendency to leave their franchise networks.  Franchisee network exits can have severe consequences for a network’s viability (e.g., Mignonac et al., 2015). Moreover, exiting franchisees may spawn into new ventures or join competing networks, or they may even exit collectively and jointly start new competing networks (Croonen & Brand, 2010). The few studies that explain franchisee network exit intentions typically focus on the effects of franchisees’ unilateral perceptions direct exchange outcomes with the franchisor (e.g., López-Fernández & López-Bayon, 2018; Meek et al., 2011). We extend these studies by arguing that the combination of direct  generalized exchanges leads to specific economic and social exchange outcomes and trust and control challenges. We include the franchisor’s trust in each franchisee and its network control as important contextual conditions that shape franchisee valuation of exchange outcomes (cf., Das & Teng, 2001; Long & Sitkin, 2018). To test our hypotheses, we analyze primary data collected in one franchise network, including - among others - dyadic data of 120 franchisor-franchisee dyads, franchisee exit intentions, and subsequent exit behaviors (for a post-study check). We make three contributions to franchising research. First, by incorporating the franchisor’s trust in each individual franchisee as important contextual condition, we assess dyadic franchisor-franchisee relationships as opposed to relying solely on franchisee unilateral perceptions. Trust asymmetry may exist in leader-member dyads (e.g., Graebner et al., 2018; Korsgaard et al., 2015), and the inclusion of both franchise partners’ trusting perspectives shows the impact of symmetric and asymmetric trust constellations on franchisee network exit intentions. Our inclusion of perceptions from both franchiseparties is essential as they form the foundation of mutual reciprocity (Brower et al., 2000; 2009). We demonstrate that the effects of franchisee exchange outcomes on their network exit intentions vary according to the trust of the franchisor in them.  Second, franchisors perform an important network control function by monitoring the behaviors and outputs of franchisees to safeguard franchisee quality output and cooperation, and hence exchange outcomes (Combs & Ketchen, 2003; Kasyhap et al., 2012). We introduce franchisee assessments of the franchisor’s network control as a relevant contextual condition to explain their network exit intentions. Our results show that the franchisor’s network control can seriously damage the continuation of franchise relationships. High levels of network control may make franchisees indifferent to positive economic outcomes and may incline franchisees with high trust in their peers to forge activities outside the network.  Third, we adopt a multi-referent perspective on trust – as a social outcome of exchange relationships (Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012; Zaheer et al., 1998) – to develop a more fine-grained understanding of how trust impacts franchisee exit intentions. We show that while trust between the franchisor and franchisees strengthens the network and reduces franchisee network exits, trust among franchisee peers may damage the network by encouraging franchisees to (jointly) exit the network in high network-control situations. The mechanism behind this exit-promoting effect is that franchisees’ trust in each other facilitates peer cooperation, learning, and coalition formation (cf., Greve et al., 2010; Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012). Operating as a collective, franchisees can gain leverage against the powerful franchisor and restore the power balance in their favor, or establish the capability to pursue outside options collectively.  In sum, we demonstrate the pivotal roles of the franchisor’s trust and control in shaping franchisee network exit intentions as they differentially impact their valuations of economic and social exchange outcomes and thereby moderate the effects of franchisee perceived exchange outcomes on their network exit intentions. THEORETICAL BACKGROUNDS AND HYPOTHESES SET in a Franchise Context SET is a broad and influential paradigm for understanding intentions and behaviors in exchange relationships (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). SET’s basic tenet is that individuals enter, maintain, and exit relationships based on the past and anticipated outcomes that accompany them (Blau, 1964). Depending on the type of exchange, partners may seek different types of exchange outcomes (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005). Social exchange as an ongoing reciprocal process in which exchanges of benefits between parties result in social norms of obligation and reciprocity. Moreover, some exchange partners may be more powerful than others, resulting in power asymmetry and relational tensions (Blau, 1964; Cook & Emerson, 1978; Das & Teng 2002b). In recent decades, SET has become a popular perspective in examining business relationships (Coyle-Shapiro & Diehl, 2018; Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). Business exchange partners typically base their decisions to stay in or leave their relationships on the perceived economic and social outcomes derived from these relationships (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Rowley et al., 2005). In our study, the economic outcomes comprise franchisee satisfaction with the economic results from their franchise network membership. Moreover, since exchange is risky, contracts are incomplete, and perfect network control is impossible (Blau, 1964; Das & Teng, 1998, 2001, 2002b), franchisee trust in their franchisor and trust in their peers are two important social outcomes that directly affect their network exit intentions. Moreover, through their trust and network control behaviors, franchisors govern the direct and generalized exchange context of franchisees and thereby play a critical role in franchisee outcome valuations (cf., Das & Teng, 2001; Long & Sitkin, 2018). Figure 1 depicts our theoretical framework and hypotheses, which we explain in more detail below.  -------------------------- Insert Figure 1 about here -------------------------- Direct Effects of Economic and Social Exchange Outcomes Economic exchange outcomes. Economic satisfaction comprises the (dis)confirmation of economic or instrumental expectations over the history of the exchange relationship (Rowley et al., 2005). When economic outcomes are below expectations, partners become dissatisfied and may pursue alternative options (Blau, 1964; Lambe et al., 2001). Economic outcomes are important in franchise networks because franchisees cooperate to ultimately gain economically from the relationship (Davies et al., 2011), and franchisee satisfaction with economic outcomes lowers their network exit intentions (Meek et al., 2011; Mignonac et al., 2015). Hence: Hypothesis 1a: Franchisee economic satisfaction is negatively related with network exit intentions.  Social exchange outcomesTrust is a necessary ingredient for stable relationships and a relevant social outcome in business relationships (Cropanzano & Mitchell, 2005; Lioukas & Reuer, 2015). Trust reduces partners’ perceived exchange risks resulting from having exchange partners that are not willing or able to reciprocate (Das & Teng, 2001; 2002b), and it helps partners to bond emotionally (Lambe et al., 2001; Rowley et al., 2005). Trust reflects a partner’s positive expectations that the other partner will reciprocate by fulfilling its obligations in the exchange relationship (Blau, 1964; Lambe et al., 2001). Extant SET studies typically focus on trust in a single referent, whereas it is important to consider multiple trust referents (Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012; Long & Sitkin, 2018). We identify franchisee trust in the franchisor  trust in peers as essential social outcomes. Franchisee trust in franchisor. Economic motives between franchisors and franchisees are not fully aligned (Combs et al., 2004; López-Fernández & López-Bayon, 2018). From the franchisee perspective, risks resulting from this are aggravated by the asymmetrical control of the franchisor which provides the leader with power over the members (Croonen, 2010). Franchisees are thus vulnerable to their franchisor’s actions, which makes trust in the franchisor important to franchisees. This trust is crucial to maintaining the relationship by reducing franchisee perceived direct exchangerisks via stronger goal alignment and greater likelihood of goal attainment (cf. Das & Teng, 2001; Davies et al., 2011). If franchisees expect their franchisor to be willing and able to fulfill its exchange obligations, they are more likely to anticipate positive future economic outcomes and to reciprocate. Hence: Hypothesis 1b: Franchisee trust in franchisor is negatively related with network exit intentions.  Franchisee trust in peers.Based on one stream within SET (Das & Teng, 2002a), one could argue that since franchisees operate under a shared business format within a network, they are all affected by their peers’ contributions to shared goals and resources. Franchisees must thus trust that their peers are willing and able to comply with the franchisor’s guidelines and norms (Combs et al., 2004). Franchisees typically rely on the franchisor to coordinate the generalized exchange among franchisees. Moreover, franchisee trust in peers decreases their perceptions of the generalized exchange risks and increase the perceived likelihood of positive future economic outcomes, which may lower franchisee intentions to leave the network (cf., Das & Teng, 2002a).  However, within SET there is also a research stream accounting for power differences among exchange partners, which would propose an opposite effect. The way in which trust impacts behaviors varies according to the power of the individual actor relative to its counterparts (Blau, 1964). A franchisor usually has more power than its individual franchisees due to the contractual relationship in which the franchisor imposes obligations on franchisees (cf., Davies et al., 2011; Human & Provan, 2000). Several SET scholars have argued that unbalanced power relations are inherently instable and produce frictions and tensions among parties, such that less powerful parties engage in one or several ‘balancing operations’, such as withdrawal and coalition formation (e.g., Cook & Emerson, 1978; Emerson, 1962, 1964; Greve et al., 2010). Thus, in dealing with their franchisor, franchisees are continuously incentivized to engage in balancing operations to move the balance in their favor. Peer trust may facilitate such operations via different forms of peer cooperation (Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012) and cohesion (Greve et al., 2010). Actors who trust their peers share more information and knowledge and are more likely to help each other (El Akremi et al., 2011; Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012) by jointly taking on functional tasks (Human & Provan, 1997), and forming coalitions (Croonen & Brand, 2010; Greve et al., 2010). The collective learning and countervailing power enable the pursuit of difficult yet potentially rewarding opportunities outside the focal network that cannot be attained individually (Greve et al., 2010). As franchisees’ trust in peers boosts their confidence and opportunities to seek such outside options, it is hypothesized to increase franchisees’ propensity to (jointly) leave the network. Hence: Hypothesis 1c: Franchisee trust in peers is positively related with network exit intentions.  Moderating Effects of the Franchisor’s Trust and Control Trust and control determine the effective governance of cooperative relationships through affecting partners’ perceived exchange risks (e.g., Das & Teng, 2001; Long & Sitkin, 2018). In franchise networks, the franchisor shapes the franchisees’ valuations of exchange outcomes through its trust in specific franchisees (cf., direct leader-member exchanges) and through its network control behaviors aimed at controlling the generalized exchange among the franchisees. Franchisor’s trust in franchisees. In line with LMX research, we argue that franchisees are sensitive to the franchisor’s trust in them as it creates a safe and fulfilling relational context for them (cf. Brower et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2013). If the franchisor trusts a franchisee, it tends to display positive signals and trusting behaviors towards this franchisee, signaling to the trusted franchisee that it appreciates the relationship, intends to continue it and anticipates future gains from cooperation. Trusted franchisees feel more valued because they attain more status, encouragement, coaching and support (Bagger & Li, 2014; Brower et al., 2009).  Regarding the economic outcomes, franchisees who are trusted by the franchisor may attribute their economic outcomes to result from a joint effort with the franchisor rather than from an individual effort (cf., Gong et al., 2013; Lambe et al., 2001). The status, encouragement, coaching and support that trusted franchisees receive from their franchisors make them feel like they are part of a preferred ‘ingroup’ (Lau & Liden, 2008), making these franchisees more aware of the added value of the franchise network for achieving their economic outcomes. We hypothesize that trusted franchisees will more strongly reduce their exit intentions based on their economic satisfaction compared with franchisees who are not trusted by the franchisor. Building on these arguments, we hypothesize the following interaction effect:Hypothesis 2:The franchisor’s trust in franchisees strengthens the negative relationship between franchisee economic satisfaction and network exit intentions, such that the negative relationship is stronger for higher levels of franchisor’s trust in franchisees.Regarding the social outcomes, we propose an interaction effect between franchisee trust in the franchisor and franchisor’s trust in franchisees as mutual trust is likely to produce more favorable outcomes (Bagger & Li, 2014; Ferrin et al., 2008). Several LMX studies have argued that when high levels of trust are shared between leaders and members, there is a supportive environment to develop high-quality relationships that reduces mutually perceived exchange risks, which in turn allows for mutually beneficial relationship outcomes (e.g., Brower et al., 2009; Gooty & Yammarino, 2016). Thus, an increase of the franchisee’s trust in the franchisor is particularly effective in situations in which the franchisor trusts the focal franchisee, as this reciprocity triggers positive trust spirals that strongly reduce franchisee exit intentions (Ferrin et al., 2008; Gooty & Yammarino, 2016). In settings of low franchisor’s trust in the franchisee, the franchisee will receive fewer of such reinforcing signals to further build and continue the relationship. Hence: Hypothesis 3: The franchisor’s trust in franchisees strengthens the negative relationship between franchisee trust in franchisor and network exit intentions, such that the negative relationship is stronger for higher levels of franchisor’s trust in franchisees. Franchisor’s network control.Generalized exchanges typically entail a high risk of free-riding due to their ambiguous and disjointed nature (Das & Teng, 2002a; Heidl et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012). Franchisees expect the franchisor to manage these generalized exchange risks by fulfilling a control function. Such control consists of monitoring franchisees’ behaviors and taking corrective actions to maintain high levels of cooperation and guarantee high outcome quality at the network level (Combs et al., 2004; Kasyhap et al., 2012). At the same time, franchisees are independent business owners that are typically critical towards power and control exercised on them since it limits their autonomy (Dada, 2018; Dant & Gundlach, 1999). Network control is a mechanism to protect the franchised business format, but in situations where franchisees perceive such control as excessive, it can lead to their psychological reactance (cf. Heide et al., 2007), and thereby change franchisee valuation of exchange outcomes. We hypothesize that the negative effect of franchisee economic satisfaction on network exit intentions is weaker when franchisees experience high levels of franchisor’s network control. In situations of low franchisor’s control, an increase of economic satisfaction may strongly reduce exit intentions as the low network control allows franchisees to keep some autonomy and to perceive value congruence with the leader (Das & Teng, 2001; Kashyap et al., 2012). However, in high franchisor’s network control situations, similar economic improvements are less effective, because franchisees interpret the franchisor’s network control no longer as network vigilance but as an unnecessary reduction in their autonomy and as a (self-interested) means of the franchisor to coerce franchisor into complying with franchisor-desired behavior (cf., Sitkin et al., 2020). Hence:  Hypothesis 4: The franchisor’s network control attenuates the negative relationship between franchisee economic satisfaction and network exit intentions, such that the relationship is weaker for higher levels of franchisor’s network control. Finally, regarding the social outcomes, we hypothesize that the positive relationship between franchisee trust in peers and network exit intentions becomes even stronger in high network control situations. Trust and control are both mechanisms that will lower franchisee perceived generalized exchange risks within the network, as they facilitate cooperation and reduce opportunistic behaviors. Research has shown that these mechanisms can be complements or substitutes (Long & Sitkin, 2018), suggesting that social control (trust) and formal control (control) can go hand-in-hand or become incompatible, depending on the context and timing (Bijlsma-Frankema & Costa, 2005). We posit that franchisee (horizontal) trust in each other and the franchisor’s network (vertical) control are to a certain extent incompatible and will generate competitive effects. Peer trust reflects a sharing of norms and social cohesion among like-minded members (Das & Teng, 2002a; Greve et al., 2010), while control consists of franchisees being externally monitored by the franchisor who takes corrective action if needed (Combs et al., 2004; Kasyhap et al., 2012). An increase in peer trust is therefore particularly effective in reducing perceived exchange risks when the franchisor’s leader control is low, as social control mechanisms are then installed and taken care of by the franchisees themselves. In high network control situations, an increase of peer trust would make the strong control of the franchisor to become redundant, costly and even excessive (cf., Heidl et al., 2014). In such situations, franchisees will more easily feel coerced and confined by the franchisor, such that an increase in peer trust will lead to even stronger peer cooperation, coalition formation and withdrawal intentions (cf., Emerson, 1964; Cook & Emerson, 1978) – as compared with low control situations. Hence, network control amplifies the positive effect of a franchisee’s trust in peers on its exit intentions, resulting in: Hypothesis 5: The franchisor’s network control strengthens the positive relationship between franchisee peer trust and network exit intentions, such that the relationship is stronger for higher levels of franchisor network control. RESEARCH METHOD Research Context, Sample, and Data Collection We collected data on franchisor-franchisee relationships within a single franchise network (pseudonym: @Home) providing home services to Dutch customers. The network provides the franchisees with a strong brand name and collective marketing, training, and access to services such as insurance and guarantee schemes. In addition, @Home strictly mandates consistent presentations toward customers (e.g., company uniforms, vehicles), and the use of a shared digital information and communication system.  At the time of data collection, the network had 209 franchisees who usually knew each other personally through, for example, joint meetings and/or joint assignments. The franchisees are all single-unit franchisees. The survey was sent to all franchisees. Of the 135 franchisees who responded to the survey, 120 survey forms were complete. In the same period, the franchisor’s management team provided us with data on their assessment of each franchisee, resulting in data on 120 franchisor-franchisee dyads. The net response rate (57%) is high, and helped to ensure the representativeness of our sample compared to the network’s population. Measures and Measurement Properties The Appendix shows all measurement items. Unless otherwise indicated, all items were measured on five-point Likert scales.Dependent variable. We measurednetwork exit intention using seven items derived from the behavioral loyalty intentions scale developed by Kelloway et al. (1999). Independent variables Economic satisfaction (ES) was measured using four items. These items cover the franchisee’s perceived general business success, satisfaction with its economic performance, realization of its specific economic goals, and relative economic performance compared to the industry (Cochet et al., 2008; Dant & Gundlach, 1999). Franchisee’s trust in franchisor (FTO) was measured with six items derived from Mayer and Gavin (2005) and Searle et al. (2011). Franchisee’s trust in peers (FTP) was measured using four items based on Cook and Wall (1980) and Kiffin-Petersen and Cordery (2003). These studies have used these items to measure organizational members’ trust in their coworkers. These items do not reflect trust in specific peers, but – in line with generalized exchanges and reciprocity – refer to the trust in the population of peers belonging to the franchise network.Moderating variables. To measure the franchisor’s trust in franchisee (FTE), we asked the management of the franchisor’ organization to assess each individual franchisee on three items reflecting the franchisee’s trustworthy behaviors regarding contribution, goodwill, and compliance (cf., Brower et al., 2000). To measure the franchisee’s perception franchisor’s network control (FNC), we developed a three-item scale based on studies on monitoring and enforcement in inter-firm channel relationships (Antia & Frazier, 2001; Kashyap et al., 2012).Control variables. We include franchise relationship and franchisee characteristics as control variables. Franchise relationship characteristics include the duration of the relationship, the member’s assessment of alternatives, and switching costs (Cochet et al., 2008; Meek et al., 2011; Mignonac et al., 2015). For relationship duration (REL), we use the number of years that a franchisee has been part of the @Home network. Four items measure the attractiveness of outside alternatives (ALT), while switching costs (SWI) are measured with three items. Franchisee characteristics include the franchisee’s industry experience. We take the number of years that the franchisee has been active in the specific industry as a measure of industry experience (EXP).Construct Validity and Reliability Prior to conducting the OLS regression with interaction terms, we used SmartPLS 4.0 to assess the validity and reliability of our constructs. We explored the distributions of all items and variables, and since there were no outliers we did not exclude any observations.The Appendix presents the measurement properties of our scales. All scales demonstrate convergent validity since the standardized loadings are both high and highly significant. Furthermore, the AVE of each construct is above the recommended threshold of .5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). There is evidence of discriminant validity in that the square root of the AVE is higher than each of the underlying correlations with the other constructs (see Table 1). Finally, with Cronbach’s alphas above .7 and composite reliabilities above .6, the scales can be considered reliable. To reduce the danger of common method variance in the survey data, we followed Podsakoff et al’s (2003) recommendations; we guaranteed respondents anonymity, varied measurement items and used reversed-coded items, and prevented funneling in the questionnaire design. Moreover, we investigated the degree to which item variance was explained by a single latent common method variance factor and by the corresponding latent variable. The common factor explains on average only 2% of the variance, whereas the corresponding constructs explain 67% of the variance. Only 3 of the 33 paths between the common-method variance factor and the items are significant, indicating that common method bias is not a major concern. RESULTS Descriptive Statistics Table 1 presents the descriptives of our variables and the correlation matrix. A comparison of early and late respondents reveals no significant differences in demographics or in exit intentions, indicating that non-response bias is unlikely to be a problem. Moreover, multicollinearity tests reveal no serious concerns; the largest variance inflation factor was 2.18, which is well below the commonly suggested cut-off value of 10 (Hair et al., 1998).-------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------- Hypotheses Testing We ran multiple OLS regression models to validate our hypotheses. Table 2 presents an overview of the results, and demonstrates the high predictive power of our model. Prior to testing for interaction effects, we ran a baseline regression model including all independent and control variables to predict franchisee network exit intentions (Model 1). We then included the interaction terms (Models 2 and 3) and ran the full model (Model 4). H1a states that franchisee economic satisfaction is negatively related with network exit intentions; however, we do not find statistically significant support (B= -.08; = .176). In support of H1b, we find that franchisee trust in leader strongly reduces network exit intentions (B= -.37, = .000). H1c, proposing a positive effect of franchisee trust in peers on network exit intentions, is supported, but only at the less restrictive 10 percent significance level (B= .12; = .068). The limited direct effects of the three drivers of franchisee network exit intentions (i.e., only trust in franchisor is a strongly significant predictor) already hints at the presence of interaction effects. Regarding the interaction effects of the franchisor’s trust in franchisee, we find a mildly significant interaction effect between economic satisfaction and franchisor’s trust in franchisee (BESxFTE= -.09, = .075). Simple slope analyses reveal a negative relationship between economic satisfaction and network exit intentions for high levels of franchisor’s trust in franchisee (B= -.17, = .073), whereas for low levels of franchisor’s trust there is no significant relationship (B= .01, .910). Figure 2 depicts this interaction effect. This finding provides modest support for H2, which states that the franchisor’s trust in franchisee strengthens the negative relationship between franchisees’ economic satisfaction and their network exit intentions. We find a significant interaction effect between the franchisor’s trust in franchisee and franchisee trust in franchisor; however, it contradicts H3. Instead of strengthening the negative effect of franchisee trust in franchisor on network exit intentions, franchisor’s trust in franchisee attenuates the effect (BFTOxFTE= .15, = .007). Simple slope analyses show that the negative relationship between franchisee trust in franchisor and network exit intentions is stronger (i.e., more negative) for franchisees in which the franchisor has a low level of trust (B= -.52, = .000) than for trusted franchisees (B= -.23, = .034). Figure 3 depicts this interaction effect. As predicted by H4, we find a positive interaction between franchisee economic satisfaction and franchisor’s network control (BESxFNC= .13; = .006). H4 hypothesizes that the franchisor’s network control attenuates the negative relationship between franchisee economic satisfaction and network exit intentions. We find support for H4, as in situations of high network control the negative relationship between economic satisfaction and exit intentions disappears. Simple slope analyses reveal that economic satisfaction reduces network exit intentions for franchisees who perceive low franchisor’s network control (B= -.21, =.007), whereas for franchisees who perceive high franchisor’s network control this relationship is insignificant (B= .05, = .537). Figure 4 depicts this interaction effect. Finally, we find an interaction between the franchisee trust in peers and franchisor’s network control (BFTPxFNC= .13, = .009). As hypothesized in H5, in situations of high franchisor’s network control, we see a positive relationship between franchisee trust in peers and network exit intentions. Simple slope analyses demonstrate a positive relationship between franchisee trust in peers and network exit intentions in situations of high franchisor’s network control (B= .25, = .009), whereas in situations of low franchisor’s network control the relationship is not significant (B= -.02, = .821). Figure 5 shows this interaction plot. Finally, we find – in line with Brower et al. (2009) – that franchisor’s trust in franchisee directly reduces franchisee network exit intentions (B= -.16, =. 019). Next, two control variables significantly impact franchisee network exit intentions; as expected, alternatives have a positive effect on exit intentions (B= .40, p= .000), whereas switching costs (B= -.21, = .002) have a negative effect. -------------------------- Insert Table 2 and Figures 2-5 about here -------------------------- Post-study check: linking exit intention to exit behavior To check our assumption and to assess the predictive validity of exit intentions as a construct, we complemented our data with actual franchisee exit data four years after the initial data collection. This timeframe ensured that each franchisee had the option to leave the network voluntarily and was not restricted by any contractual regulations. Of our 120 respondents, 45 (37.5%) had left the @Home network. Based on data retrieved from the franchisor, we first removed 12 franchisees who left the network involuntarily (i.e., bankruptcy, illness, and the franchisor’s decision to terminate the contract), leaving 33 ‘voluntary exits’ in our cleaned sample. After removing the 12 ‘involuntary exits’, we subjected the remaining 108 respondents to a logistic regression analysis regressing the control variables, independent variables and network exit intentions on actual exit behavior as the binary dependent variable. Network exit intention is the only significant predictor of actual exit behavior (B=2.47 = .000; Nagelkerke’s R = 0.281). We also used Mackinnon and Dwyer’s (1993) approach to assess the mediation effects using a dichotomous dependent variable (exit behavior). The results reveal that the effects of economic satisfaction, franchisee trust in franchisor, switching costs and alternatives on exit behavior are fully or partially mediated by the franchisee network exit intention, and that network exit intentions strongly predict actual network exit behavior. DISCUSSION Our study advances franchising research by developing and testing a SET-based framework to explain why and under what contextual conditions franchisees intend to leave their franchise networks. Below, we discuss our results and highlight the specific implications for theory and practice, and we provide directions for future research. Theoretical Implications The pivotal role of the franchisor’s trust in franchisee. Our findings stress the importance of taking a dyadic perspective to explain franchisee network exit intentions. The franchisor’s trust in each franchisee does not uniformly enhance franchisee valuation of exchange outcomes. While high franchisor’s trust in franchisee strengthens franchisee valuation of economic outcomes and thus strengthens the negative relationship between economic satisfaction and network exit intentions, it – unexpectedly – does not further enhance franchisee valuations of the social outcome of their trust in franchisor. Our result that economic satisfaction only significantly reduces franchisee network exit intentions when franchisor’s trust in franchisee is high indicates that the valuation of franchisee economic benefits crucially depends on the franchisor’s trust. In situations of high franchisor’s trust in franchisee, franchisees receive positive signals and perceive a high-quality relationship with the franchisor, and expect positive outcomes in the future. Such situations create a cooperative setting between franchisees and franchisors and facilitate the recognition and valuation of economic benefits that result from the network exchange. In situations where the franchisor lacks trust in the franchisee, such signals about a positive future and the franchisor’s desire to continue the relationship are absent. This may lead the franchisee to interpret that economic outcomes result from an individual rather than from a collective effort. Our finding empirically confirms the implicit assumption made in other SET and LMX studies that a leader’s trust in member enhances the member’s valuation of exchange outcomes (cf., Brower et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2013). However, opposite to this assumption, we find that franchisees who trust the franchisor derive less value from the franchisor’s trust in them than franchisees who have low trust in the franchisor. Our finding can be explained by the findings of Anand et al. (2010) who show that employees in a high-quality relationship with their leader derive less value from their leader’s signs of appreciation because this appreciation is ‘more of the same’. In a similar vein, franchisees who highly trust their franchisor may perceive a reciprocal trust signal from the franchisor as yet another positive signal in an already valued relationship. At the same time, we find that decreasing levels of a franchisee trust in the franchisor are much more detrimental to the continuance of the relationship when the franchisor lacks trust in the franchisee as compared to when the franchisor has high trust in the franchisee. In such low-trust situations, the relationship may deteriorate quickly via negative trust spirals (Ferrin et al., 2008).The pivotal role of the franchisor’s network control The franchisor’s network control moderates the effects of franchisee exchange outcomes on their network exit intentions, such that it devalues economic outcomes and strengthens the effects of peer trust as a social outcome. A high franchisor’s network control weakens the exit-reducing effect of economic satisfaction, and it enhances the exit-promoting effect of franchisee trust in peers. First, we find that franchisees attach less value to their economic satisfaction under high franchisor’s network control conditions. An explanation is that under high levels of network control, franchisees are more likely to perceive the franchisor’s controlling behaviors as an excessive and obtrusive use of the franchisor’s power (cf., Heide et al., 2007; Sitkin et al., 2020). Higher economic outcomes boost franchisee self-confidence and trigger economically satisfied franchisees to leave their network under high network control situations because such control undermines their autonomy and creates value incongruence with the franchisor (cf. Das & Teng, 2002b; Long & Sitkin, 2018). Second, we find that the marginally positive effect of franchisee trust in peers on their network exit intentions becomes a strongly positive effect when franchisees experience high franchisor’s network control. Two underlying mechanisms can explain why horizontal peer trust and vertical leader control in franchise networks are incompatible. First, as also suggested by research on trust among co-workers (e.g., Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012), peer trust creates a high-quality exchange and forges a stronger bond between parties with similar roles and interests. Such cohesion effects lead to a bundling of power and peer information exchange and learning that reduce the power of the leader. Second, when peers strengthen their relationships and form closely-knit (sub)groups, this automatically affects the relationship each member has with the network leader (cf. Greve et al., 2010). In case of a high franchisor’s network control, an increase in peer trust can lead to ‘social distancing’ between the franchisor and its franchisees because franchisees interpret the franchisor’s control as redundant and undesirable given the low risks that derive from generalized exchanges with highly trusted peers. Franchisees respond to such coercive control by engaging in balancing operations to restore the power balance, which ultimately increases the likelihood of withdrawal or coalition formation. In low network control settings, an increase in franchisee peer trust facilitates the continuation of network membership, as franchisees perceive greater autonomy and feel less compelled to engage in such balancing operations, while at the same time they can benefit from increased peer cooperation and reduced generalized exchange risks that result from withholding of information and deviation from standards by peers (cf. Das & Teng, 2002a; El Akremi et al., 2011). Our findings imply that franchising research should include the role of the franchisor’s network control in explaining franchisee behavioral intentions. Network control reflects an important strategic trade-off for franchisors: on the one hand, network control is needed to secure cooperation and limit franchisee opportunistic behaviors, such that franchisees can achieve economic and/or social outcomes in the long run, but on the other hand, franchisees may perceive network control as redundant and obtrusive as soon as these outcomes are achieved.  The multi-referent nature of franchisee social outcomes.Our analysis shows that trust in franchise networks is a double-edged sword that could foster and limit franchisee network exits. While a franchisee’s trust in the franchisor has a very strong and consistent negative direct effect on exit intentions, we find a marginally positive overall effect of a franchisee’s trust in peers, which increases sharply when the franchisor’s network control is high. Peer trust allows franchisees to learn from each other and help each other (cf., Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2012), such that they can increase their confidence to successfully pursue outside options. This suggests that higher peer trust may spur a phenomenon which we refer to as ‘network spawning’: franchisees leave their networks to continue their business without being part of a franchise network because they accumulate enough knowledge and resources to run their business and create value outside the network without sharing the rents with the franchisor. In a post-study check, we find clear evidence of such network spawning: of the 33 @Home franchisees that ultimately left the network voluntarily, 30 (91%) continued their business on their own in the same industry. Several @Home franchisees continued to cooperate (e.g., on joint assignments) with former network peers after exiting. This possibility of social exchange outcomes persisting after leaving a franchise network provides an interesting avenue for future research. Managerial implications  Assuming that franchisors generally want to avoid franchisee network exits, we derive the following managerial implications. First, franchisee trust in franchisor is a major determinant of their network exit intentions, so franchisors should create trust by demonstrating an overall ability and willingness to manage the franchise network. We also show that for franchisors it is a good strategy to keep on demonstrating a positive trusting attitude towards franchisees, because such a trusting stance dampens the adversarial effects of franchisees’ low levels of trust in franchisor. In responding to franchisee failures or opportunistic manifestations, franchisors are advised to take corrective action but stress their continuation of trust in them. Second, franchisors should realize that franchisee trust in peers can develop a countervailing power towards the franchisor as they can learn to collectively imitate the franchisor’s resources and build a new competitive position for themselves outside the network. This probability is especially high when these franchisees feel coerced (rather than enabled) by the franchisor. A final implication relates to the franchisor’s network control since high network control may make franchisees indifferent to positive economic exchange outcomes and it may have network-destabilizing effects for franchisees with high trust in their peers. To avoid such effects, franchisors could reduce franchisee perceived power asymmetry, for example, by granting franchisees more decision rights or autonomy in specific domains (e.g., Dada, 2018), and/or by setting up a franchisee consultation structure (e.g., Grace et al. 2020). Limitations and Further Research While studying a single franchise network allowed us to control for industry and network differences and thus to improve internal validity (Davies et al., 2011), this choice affects the generalizability of our findings. Although we would not expect radically different findings in other franchise network contexts, franchise networks may have specific characteristics (e.g. centralization levels) that influence franchisee exit intentions. Second, future research could go beyond the franchisor’s role and investigate how franchisee characteristics, such as their propensity to trust or their importance attached to reciprocity, shape their valuation of network outcomes and exit intentions. Third, given that franchisee trust in peers strongly promotes their network exit intentions in high franchisor network control situations, research should try to open the ‘black box’ of peer trust and peer cooperation. Future research could build on literature on networking behaviors to better understand trust and social interactions among specific franchisees. Finally, although we could link exit intentions to exit behaviors, our results provide limited insight into the dynamic processes and events ultimately leading to these behaviors. More fine-grained longitudinal data would help to understand how franchisee network exit intentions ultimately translate into exit behaviors and network instability.

       "A Dynamic Capabilities PerspectiveAbstract\n",
       "A stream of research indicates that dynamic capabilities (DCs) increase the competitive-ness and innovation of companies. Companies need to develop DCs to gain a competitive advantage. According to Wang and Ahmed (2007), DCs encompass the capacities of adaptation, absorption and innovation. This research seeks to understand how franchise networks innovate in terms of innovation capacity and DCs. \n",
       "Franchise networks represent an interesting ground for this analysis because they are sub-ject to dialectics on the role of innovation in maintaining a competitive advantage. This research uses a qualitative methodology involving 24 interviews within 16 French franchise networks. Our results point to two categories of franchise networks. The first one corresponds to networks that are performing well but do not own DCs and the second one corresponds to networks that are performing well and own DCs. Finally, we propose to consider the innovation capacity as a component of DCs according to the model of Wang and Ahmed (2007).\n",

       "INTRODUCTION \n",
       "One line of research stresses that dynamic capabilities (DCs) make it possible to increase the competitiveness and innovation of firms (Teece et al., 1997; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Indeed, firms must develop DCs in order to gain a competitive advantage (Teece et al., 1997; Augier and Teece, 2009). These capabilities are defined here as \"the potential of a firm to systematically solve problems, constituted by its propensity to identify oppor-tunities and threats, to make timely market-oriented decisions, and to change its resource base.\"(Barreto, 2010, p. 271). They involve recurrent, persistent systems and intentionali-ty on the part of companies to identify opportunities in the environment and change their routines (Zollo and Winter, 2002). However, despite the growing number of works on DCs (Vögel and Güttel, 2013), there is a persistent lack of consensus surrounding this concept (Meurier and Gieu, 2014). In particular, the role of innovation capacity in the de-velopment of DCs and the maintenance of a competitive advantage are well debated, es-pecially for firms operating in moderately dynamic environments (Wang and Ahmed, 2007; Peteraf et al., 2013; Breznik and Hisrich, 2014). This debate has substantial opera-tional consequences for organisations operating in relatively predictable environments.\n",
       "The innovation capacity is sometimes considered as a particular type of DC, which may prove to be indispensable in certain sectors of activity. However, according to this conception, companies can create and maintain an advantage by deploying other DCs than the sole capacity for innovation (capacity for rapid decision-making, strategic rene-wal or acquisition). On the contrary, for Wang and Ahmed (2007), the innovation capacity is, along with the capacity for absorption and the capacity for adaptation, an indispen-sable element for the emergence of DCs, which will ultimately allow an advantage in terms of performance for the company. While previous research has highlighted the rela-tionship between DCs and innovation (e.g. Ambrosini, Bowman and Collier, 2009; Helfat et al., 2007; Teece, 2007; Teece et al., 1997), it seems to us essential to understand how franchise networks innovate and maintain a competitive advantage in environments that are characterised by a moderate level of dynamism.\n",
       "Franchising is an important source of entrepreneurial growth involving two different types of entrepreneurs: the franchisor who has identified an opportunity and manages its distribution system and its image in geographically dispersed locations, and franchisees who exploit the opportunity locally (Gillis et al., 2020). This mode of network organisa-tion allows rapid growth thanks to the replication of know-how and the standardisation of the offer and of the processes deployed (Gorovaia, 2017; Windsperger and Gorovaia, 2011). Indeed, high-performance networks are those that are capable of replicating the concept to generate a competitive advantage (Perrigot et al., 2017). While it is generally accepted that know-how is the basis for the creation of a competitive advantage for fran-chises, the mechanisms for maintaining this advantage remain to be defined. In a compe-titive environment, networks need to keep abreast of market developments so that they can react accordingly and reconfigure their resource base (Boulay and Chanut, 2010). DCs thus provide a highly relevant analytical framework for franchising (El Akremi et al., 2015). According to Teece, (2007) DCs operate in high velocity sectors while Eisen-hardt and Martin (2000) suggest that DCs can also be mobilized in more stable environ-ments. Similarly, the links between DCs and innovation capacity remain to be established in franchising arrangements. However, this context of franchising is subject to dialectics on the role of innovation in maintaining competitive advantage (Szulanski and Jensen, 2006; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001) and is particularly relevant for understanding how franchise networks innovate and the role of innovation capacity in DCs. \n",
       "To answer this question, we conducted 24 interviews (19 franchisors and 5 franchisees) within 16 French franchise networks. Our results highlight two categories of networks: a first category of networks that offer quality performance but do not own DCs and a se-cond category of networks that offer quality performance and own DCs. Similarly, we provide an in-depth overview of DCs with regard to their innovation capacity.\n",
       "This work is structured in four parts. The first part sheds light on the literature review, the second part presents the research methodology, the third part presents the results and the fourth part consists of discussing the results obtained.\n",
       "1. THE DCs APPROACH1.1 THE NATURE OF DCThe concept of DCs has attracted widespread attention from management science researchers in recent years (Barreto, 2010). The starting point of this theory is as follows: if a company wishes to maintain a competitive advantage, it should not only be able to exploit resources that it possesses in-house, or can mobilize externally, but should also develop new skills that will enable it to adapt to and benefit from changes in the environment (Depeyre and Mirc, 2007). The studies then identified DCs as capabilities that enable companies to match their in-house resources and skills with the external environment. Thus, the pioneering work of Teece et al, (1997) and Teece (2007, 2009), emphasizes that DCs aim to identify opportunities by scanning, researching and exploring technologies and markets to respond to the rapid evolutions of the environment. They are also associated with the organisation's ability to intentionally create, expand or modify its resource base (Helfat et al., 2007; Teece et al., 1997). As the definition of DCs does not reach consensus, it is necessary to explicitly specify the chosen design in order to remove any ambiguity and to distinguish them from related concepts (Schilke et al., 2018). Thus, we follow the perspective of Barreto (2010) and consider DCs as embedded elements in structured and recurrent processes that are therefore different from ad hoc problem solving (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007). We also note that these elements must be stable (Zollo and Winter, 2002) and must enable the organisation to make decisions before their competitors (Barreto, 2010). These must lead to value creation for customers by reconfiguring the organisation's resource and skill base (Teece and Pisano, 1994; Tripsas 1997; Augier and Teeece, 2008; Adner and Helfat, 2003). DCs need to be differentiated from ordinary capacities that aim to ensure the operational efficiency of the organisation since they aim to facilitate strategic change and occur at the organisational level (Laaksonen and Peltoniemi, 2018). There is a growing body of research highlighting the characteristics of DCs in specific industries; however, there is too little research available to understand the commonalities of DCs in different industries (Wang and Ahmed, 2007). Moreover, research also focusing on DCs in non-technology sectors is sparse (Easterby-Smith et al., 2009). The following sections therefore aim to highlight the debates on DCs in moderately dynamic environments and present the model of Wang and Ahmed (2007) selected for this research.\n",
       "1.2 THE WANG AND AHMED MODEL (2007)\n",
       "DCs have been particularly studied in dynamic environments (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011). However, their nature and impact differ according to the level of dynamism of the environment (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Thus, moderately dynamic environments are characterised by more predictable changes than highly dynamic environments and by more linear strategic trajectories with more stable industrial structures. Some studies have suggested that DCs have a lower impact on maintaining competitive advantage for firms in more stable contexts. Thus, in this type of environment, managers rarely perceive the need to reconfigure their resource base and to acquire new skills; they therefore mobilise DCs less often (Ambrosini, Bowman and Collier, 2009). However, the findings are more mixed. Thus, Wilden and Gudergan (2015) show that while reconfiguring the resource base can bring benefits to companies in stable environments, the costs associated with constant environmental analysis outweigh the benefits associated with the information thus collected in such contexts. Hence, while DCs can enable companies to seize oppor-tunities in new and potentially effective ways, they do not guarantee the success or survi-val of the organisation (Zahra et al., 2006). Indeed, these capacities are necessary but not sufficient to maintain a competitive advantage. They thus create value but in an indirect way (Zahra et al., 2006; Helfat and Peteraf, 2003), i.e. DCs \"do not involve the produc-tion of a good or the provision of a marketable service\" (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003, p.999). Therefore, it is necessary to achieve capacity development that provides an advantage to the organisation in the context in which it operates (Zahra et al., 2006).\n",
       "In particular, Wang and Ahmed (2007) identify three components that would be common to DCs in an untested theoretical model: \n",
       "-the capacity to adapt, which enables the company to identify and capitalise on new op-portunities by making a flexible use of resources; \n",
       "-the absorption capacity which consists in defining the value of external information and assimilating it;\n",
       "-the innovation capacity that enables the development of new products, services or pro-cesses. \n",
       "According to the authors, these three dimensions are connected and underpinned by pro-cesses of integration, reconfiguration, renewal and re-creation. This model, strongly ins-pired by Teece's definition, is meant to be integrative and the 3 capacities mentioned above would be valid whatever the context in which the organisation operates. However, we may question the role of the innovation capacity in relatively stable environments such as franchising. Indeed, in this type of environment, the benefits of replicating, on a large scale a know-how, resulting from the company's experience and therefore perfectly mastered, may be greater than those generated by the launch of new products or services (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Similarly, according to the study carried out by Wilden and Gudergan (2015), the effects of absorption capacity may be limited in stable envi-ronments. Another perspective, though presenting similarities, is included in the synthesis model of Schilke et al (2018). Thus, the capacity to develop new products and services is presented as being a particular dimension (among others) of DCs. This dimension is the most studied one by researchers. This implies, as in the perspective of Eisenhardt and Martin (2000), that companies could develop other types of DCs in order to perform well. These different approaches to DCs lead us to wonder about the role of innovation capaci-ty as defined by Wang and Ahmed (2007) in the DCs of franchise networks. The follo-wing sections shed light on the specificities of the franchise model and of DCs in franchi-sing.\n",
       "2. THE FRANCHISE \n",
       "2.1. THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE FRANCHISE MODEL Franchising is an organisational form that binds the franchisor (owner of a brand) and the franchisees (independent entrepreneurs) by contract. This organizational form allows the franchisee to sell the franchisor's products or services, while nonetheless respecting the franchisor's standards (Cox & Mason, 2009). Franchise networks thus develop through the replication of a concept and through outlets offering standardized products and/or services (Gorovaia, 2017). Two elements are pivotal in the creation of competitive advan-tages in franchising: the know-how that must bring value to the franchisees and be clearly identified and kept secret, and the quality of the relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee - based on a close and continuous collaboration, characterised by trust (Perrigot et al., 2017).\n",
       "Thus, according to Paswan and Wittmann (2009), the attractiveness of the network is ba-sed on the quality of the know-how developed by the franchisor. The franchisor, through his previous experience, develops a set of methods, uses and practical information that may concern the sale of products, their presentation or transformation, the reception of customers or the management of the point of sale. This knowledge, which is explicitly set out in the franchise contract, constitutes know-how and is a substantial factor in the suc-cess of the franchise. The franchisor must maintain and transfer this body of knowledge to its sub-units (Argote, 1999; Szulanski et al., 2003). According to Easterby-Smith and Lyles (2003), knowledge transfer in business networks is essential, especially for sharing know-how among network members. The success of networks depends almost entirely on the transfer of know-how from the franchisor to the franchisees (Windsperger and Goro-vaia, 2011). Indeed, successful networks are those that can ensure the replication of the concept to generate a competitive advantage (Perrigot et al., 2017).\n",
       "2.2. CDS IN FRANCHISE NETWORKS \n",
       "To our knowledge, the studies involving DCs and franchising have focused on performance (El Akremi et al., 2015) or on the role of the franchisor in network development (Weigel, 2020), but have not yet explored how franchise networks innovate.According to El Akremi et al, (2015) it is relevant to study DCs in the case of franchising because franchisors regularly create new skills or knowledge within the network in order to renew know-how. In a competitive environment, the network must effectively keep abreast of market developments in order to be able to react accordingly (Boulay and Cha-nut, 2010). This capacity refers to the propensity of the chain to use and redeploy re-sources to formulate and implement the best strategy to respond to market needs and out-perform competitors (Gillis and Combs, 2009; Griffith, Noble and Chen, 2006). Despite the scarcity of work on DCs in franchise networks, the literature on change and innova-tion in franchise networks indicates that the development of DCs in franchise networks would respond to a number of specificities:\n",
       "-First of all, the sectors represented in the franchise mainly concern personal or business services, restaurants, hotels, household equipment or the automobile sector. These dif-ferent fields are characterised by relatively predictable changes, a low presence of break-through innovations and well-identified market players. They can therefore be characteri-sed as being moderately dynamic;\n",
       "-Next, the know-how developed must be disseminated to all the entities in the network (Perrigot et al., 2017). Thus, the elements embedded in the processes and which make up the DCs must allow this uniform dissemination within the network;\n",
       "-The renewal, recreation, integration and reconfiguration of the resources and skills that underpin DCs can occur at both the franchisee and franchisor levels (Cox and Mason, 2007). For example, recent research shows that franchisees generate new knowledge that can lead to the launch of new offerings or processes (Dada and Watson, 2013). Franchise networks can thus develop DC-related processes both at the franchisee level, at the fran-chise head level and in the franchisee-franchisor relationship ;\n",
       "-Finally, reconfiguration and renewal of the knowledge and resource bases requires more investment in franchise networks than in traditional businesses and may be the subject of fierce resistance on the part of franchisees (Cliquet and Nguyen, 2004). Thus, since fran-chisees own their business, they must be convinced of the need for these renewals so that they will adopt them in their outlets (Ibid). The compromise between retaining the status quo in the face of the transformations of the environment and not mobilizing DCs, trans-forming the resources and skills in the network and assuming the cost of this transforma-tion is thus commonly done in franchising.\n",
       "In the literature review, we have shown the relevance of applying an analytical frame-work to DCs for franchise networks. We have also been able to demonstrate that while DCs in this context share a number of characteristics with DCs in moderately dynamic environments, there are, nevertheless, specificities. We therefore wish to conduct an ex-ploratory empirical study to specify these differences and to deepen the reflection on the particular role of innovation capacity in DCs for franchise networks. Indeed, if the ab-sorption capacity (the acquisition of knowledge from different sources) seems to be at the heart of the competitive advantage in franchising (Paswan et al., 2014), research provides more mixed results regarding the capacity for innovation and adaptation (Khelil et al., 2020; Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001). Thus, too frequent innovations and uncontrolled local adaptations can harm the performance of the network. We therefore conducted a qualitative study among 16 French franchise networks. \n",
       "3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n",
       "3.1. DATA COLLECTION\n",
       "To achieve this aim, we interviewed representatives of several franchise networks belon-ging to different sectors that we characterise as moderately dynamic. We have chosen a diversity of cases and representations from different sectors of activity in order to be able to bring out common elements concerning the nature of DCs in franchise networks. Our research method is centred on the comparative studies of 16 franchise networks. A brief description of the cases can be consulted in the appendix. Table 1 lists the characteristics of the networks studied in terms of size and sector of activity.\n",

Press releases and articles in the specialised press are therefore nu-merous and provide rich information on the network's trajectory in terms of performance and innovation. We have thus consulted the annual reports of the networks, the articles in the press specialised in franchising such as L'express, Franchise Magazine, the Franchise Observatory, Toute la franchise, AC Franchise, Franchise commerce, Les Echos de la Franchise, Place des franchises, the official website of the French Franchise Federation or even LSA-conso. We have also taken into consideration information from the websites of the selected franchise networks as well as articles from specialised sites on the network sector. We thus also have data concerning the dynamism of the different networks' sectors of activity and can compare the growth of the franchise with that of its sector of activity, in particular to evaluate the maintenance (or not) of a competitive advantage. The pre-sence of certain networks in the press concerning changes in strategy or the deployment of new products/services or even awards for innovation are all elements that have enabled us to apprehend the level of dynamism of the network as well as its capacity for innova-tion. A total of 60 secondary data sources were used.\n",
       "In order to understand the nature of DCs in the different networks, 24 semi-directive in-terviews were conducted with franchisors and franchisees. The average length of the in-terviews was 35 minutes. We wished to incorporate both points of view, where possible, in order to be able to cross-check the data. Regarding the interviews with the network heads, we essentially interviewed the franchise directors or those responsible for its deve-lopment. The semi-directive interviews dealt with products/services recently introduced in the network. A discussion then took place on the changes made to the network for the design of the new product or service, such as the recruitment of a new person or the tes-ting of new machines. To be more precise, we asked the franchisor about the origin of the new product/service (customer demand, marketing idea), up to its diffusion in the net-work, including the changes necessary for the implementation of the new product/service. Due to the complexity of the object, the term \"dynamic capability\" was never used during the interviews. The objective of the interviews is to retrace the path of the innovation from the beginning to the end result obtained (implementation throughout the network or failure). It is therefore necessary to retrace the entire process in order to be able to deter-mine whether or not DCs are present. These interviews took place face-to-face or by tele-phone when a physical meeting was impossible, notably for geographical reasons or, re-cently, for health reasons (corona virus).\n",
       "3.2. DATA ANALYSIS \n",
       "We first sought to determine whether the selected networks were able to maintain a com-petitive advantage. To this end, we cross-referenced several data, including network growth in terms of franchised units from 2017 to 2019, growth in network revenue, and the number of awards or press releases issued by the trade press praising the performance of a given network over the period in question. We were thus able to distinguish between networks that do not appear to be maintaining their competitive advantage (networks with decreasing figures not justified by the industry's loss of momentum) and networks that are maintaining or increasing their competitive advantage. \n",
       "For each network, we then identified whether DCs were evident. According to Altintas (2011), DCs can be identified using the following criteria:\n",
       "-Recurrence (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece, 2007) which allows us to underline the repetitive nature of the phenomenon and to differentiate it from improvisation or ad hoc problem solving. Thus the fact that a process is repeated twice is sufficient to identify a DC (Altintas, 2011).\n",
       "-The stability of the process (Zollo and Winter, 2002). We consider the process to be stable when the new product/service is available for sale in all the units in the network to the clients of the network, thus reflecting a transfer from the franchisor to each franchised unit, which will then offer the new product/service to its clients. \n",
       "-The link between process implementations (Pablo et al., 2007). At this point, it might be possible to observe the different links when the process induces changes and that these same changes are interrelated due to path dependency (Altintas, 2011).\n",
       "-The modification of resources (Teece et al.1997; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). The new product/service provided by the network will have to lead to a change in its re-sources, such as the purchase of a new machine for example.\n",
       "We therefore consider that we are in the presence of a DC when the above-mentioned cri-teria are met.\n",
       "We then crossed the two criteria: presence or not of DCs and maintenance or not of a competitive advantage. \n",
       "Next, we determined whether the network has a capacity for innovation, absorption or adaptation using the definitions presented in Table 2.\n",

Then we will compare networks with competitive advantage and DCs. \n",
       "All the networks in our sample, even those without DCs, are adaptable. The adaptive ca-pacity notably allows them to seize market opportunities. This adaptability can manifest itself in different forms (in both categories). In our first example, network 11 is a network of personal services. More specifically, it enables professionals and individuals to obtain medical equipment. The franchisees are a real source of information for the franchisors, as they do not hesitate to bring their ideas forward. In the following verbatim, the fran-chisees asked the franchisor to set up a Drive, a technique already used in mass distribu-tion. The franchisees wanted to adapt this Drive technique to their own business so that NO CDS AND HIGH PERFOR-MANCEPRESENCE OF DCS AND PER-FORMANCENetwork 11\n",

       "\"It came from all the franchisees, they had it in mind (...) I found myself setting up a Drive service (...) and then it has to be said that health professionals are a very specific target and don't have much time, so it was particularly adapted to this target\" (Network Franchisor 11 ). \n",
       "Adaptability can also manifest itself in other ways, such as market research. A network in the food sector carried out a market study to reorient its strategy. Thanks to this market study, the network decided to move up-market.\n",
       "\"In market research, the customers finally refused to buy among mid-brand ranges, they still refuse (...) The answer of the *** brand was to go up in range, in quality, we went up in quality, we gave priority to *** so there are products that have been removed (...)\" (Network Franchisor 5).\n",
       "The ability to adapt also makes it possible to adapt the range of products provided by the network. Just to build on the example of the food sector network, the ability to adapt al-lows the franchisor to integrate the local ideas of its franchisees into the entire network. In our example, a franchisee located in Alsace wished to sell pretzels to its customers, which is a regional product that has until now not been made available for sale by the network. Following a discussion between the franchisor and this same franchisee, the network decided to support the franchisee in creating its pretzel, which is now available in the entire network in France but also in the international units of the network. \n",
       "\"For the pretzel it was one of our franchisees in the East of France who said they would like to make pretzels and it was the network leader once (...) they had determined a re-cipe, it came back to us internally and in a very collegial way the R&D worked to deve-lop a recipe, to finalise it, they then worked with the finance department to be able to eva-luate a potential profitability on this recipe and it was proposed to our franchisee\" (Net-work Franchisor 5).\n",
       "As far as high-performance networks that do not have DCs are concerned, it is possible to note the absence of absorption capacity. Absorption capacity consists in defining the val-ue of external information and assimilating it. However, the absence of this absorption capacity does not prevent the network from being efficient. Performance was assessed by the joint increase in the number of units in the network and its turnover. For example, Network 12, an automatic car wash network, already has the in-house expertise to devel-op new high-pressure washing technologies. Consequently, the resources held by the network are sufficient and do not require the search for new skills. \n",
       "\"We have teams, in fact, in R&D; moreover, we are filing patents on washing solutions\" (Network Franchisor 12).The ability to innovate enables the development of new products, services or processes. It is therefore wise to ask how these networks can be efficient without developing a capaci-ty for innovation, or even DCs. \n",
       "One possible answer lies in the strategy of the network itself. Network 13 is a franchise offering meal delivery to the elderly. Not innovating is an integral part of its strategy be-cause of the network's target: older people. Indeed, this clientele does not appreciate change. Therefore, the network makes as few changes as possible and the offer evolves rather in a generational way. \n",
       "\"For the elderly target, apart from the change from one generation to the next, we can't make more change than that because in addition, the elderly people, intrinsically don't like change too much … So it takes a bit of change so that people don't get bored but not too much either because it destabilises them\" (Network Franchisor 13).Nevertheless, the network is performing well, with its total sale increasing between 2017 and 2019 (revenue of €20 million in 2017 versus €30 million in 2019). Similarly, it is operating in a sector with 25% annual growth. Network 12 in our sample is an interesting case because it is the only performing network without DCs to have a capacity for innovation. The presence of an R&D department demonstrates the network's strong interest in innovation and requires major efforts on its part to offer more efficient services. However, our secondary data show that this network releases about one innovation every ten years. This is why we cannot speak of DCs but rather of an ad hoc innovation capacity. By ad hoc innovation we mean franchise net-works that innovate infrequently, and are therefore not subject to repetitive behaviour as DCs require. We therefore consider that a network that innovates in an ad hoc way will only occasionally propose new products to its customers. \n",
       "This capacity for innovation is nevertheless sufficient to guarantee the growth and dura-bility of the network since it received the \"Coup de coeur de la franchise: pérennité et croissance maîtrisée\" prize awarded by the Express and the Franchise Observatory. 4.2 NETWORKS WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND DCS\n",
       "In this section we compare adaptation, innovation and absorption DCs in networks with DCs and networks without DCs.According to Wang and Ahmed (2007), DCs consist of three elements. The adaptive ca-pacity, the absorptive capacity and the innovative capacity that we have already detailed above.\n",
       "Networks with a competitive advantage and DCs effectively hold these three capacities. According to our sample, these three capacities are connected to each other. The capacity to adapt triggers the franchisor's absorption capacity and the capacity to innovate seems to be the result of the mobilisation of these two capacities with the production of a new product or service from the network. Network 1 is a network in the home and leisure sec-tor. More precisely, it is a network dedicated to pets but more particularly to cats and dogs. This network is particularly proactive in the search for new opportunities in its en-vironment. The franchisor monitors international markets in order to perceive emerging market trends. Thanks to this monitoring, he has observed that customers want more na-tural products and above all products that better correspond to the real needs of their pets. These products are grain free products, i.e. without cereals, which are in fact not adapted for dogs but are nevertheless used in many food products (adaptability). The franchisor then decides to look for a new supplier who can supply products that are grain free (ab-sorption capacity). After such research, the network succeeded in developing not only several products but also several brands of grain free products. The creation of these pro-ducts and brands represents the capacity for innovation, which is none other than the re-sult of the mobilisation of the two previous capacities (capacity for adaptation and ab-sorption). We illustrate this connection using the verbatims in the table below showing the example of network 1.\n",
       "Table 4: Verbatims of the adaptation, absorption and innovation capacities of net-work 1\n",
       "M O B I L I Z E D CAPACITIESVERBATIMSAdaptability\"We realised that, by looking a little bit at the other markets, from the European markets to the American market, that there was a trend towards natural products and products that better meet the nutritional needs of dogs - what we call grain-free products, otherwise known as grain free\"Absorption capacity\"So we looked for a new supplier firstCapacity for innovation  \"So in fact today we must have… how many brands do we have today, 2,3,4,5,6...13Now that the connection between the three capacities is highlighted, they will be discus-sed further in the following paragraphs. \n",
       "As is the case with the networks in the previous category, adaptive capacity can manifest itself in a number of ways, including those presented above. However, we observe that networks with DCs have a proactive vision of their environment unlike those that do not hold such DCs. They are aware of the global market, of the customers’ needs or of market competition. For these purposes, the franchisor can for example, observe the evolution of the environment by listening to its customers. He can also take part in international trade fairs, allowing the franchisor to see what's new on the market. The franchisor can also develop a permanent presence in the field, which enables him to stay as close as possible to the reality of the franchisees and also allows him to collect feedback from franchisees and even from customers during visits. Most of the time the franchisees deal with the network managers rather than with the management of the franchise itself. These examples are illustrated by the verbatims in Table 5. \n",
       "Table 5: Verbatims about the adaptability of the franchisors surveyedFRANCHISE NETWORK VERBATIMSNetwork 7 \"The vegan market, as we saw on TV, yes, we also saw it on shop shelves; yes, there are customers at a given time, good, searching for something more natural, so we thought we'd create a vegan range\"We note that the capacity to adapt in networks holding a competitive advantage and DCs is more mobilised by franchisors, who have a proactive vision of their environment, whereas it is mainly mobilised by franchisees for networks that do not hold DCs. This proactivity can notably be seen in the systematic visits to the units, as demonstrated by the versatility of network 9 (table 5). In our example of network 11 (which has a compe-titive advantage but no DCs), we believe that the capacity to adapt is mainly mobilized by the franchisees because this network has the particularity of only owning franchised units, i.e. the network has no units of its own. We therefore consider that this network relies essentially on the franchisees of the network to detect market opportunities. \n",
       "A difference between the two categories of networks lies in their absorption capacity. In fact, networks that do not have this capacity do not develop DCs either, even if they can be efficient as we mentioned earlier. \n",
       "Absorption capacity, just like adaptability, can manifest itself in many ways. \n",

On the basis of the customers’ feedback, the network began considering it and then looked for solutions to implement the same service in a more natural way. \n",
       "In order to provide this service, network 9 then mobilised its absorption capacity so as to gather new knowledge to carry out the service: \n",
       "\"They found a manufacturer in Spain and a machine that made ozone (...) We underwent the classic process, we bought the machine, we tested several types of machines, etc.(Network Franchisor 13).\n",
       "Absorption capacity can also be demonstrated by hiring staff with the knowledge re-quired to develop a new product or service. \n",
       "Network 10, in the field of temporary agency work, wanted to provide a \"comprehensive offer\". This global offer consists of physical support in the agency and of an internet plat-form on which the agency's clients can themselves recruit their temporary workers by having access to a CV database. The implementation of this global offer and in particular the setting up of this internet platform required new knowledge as indicated in the follow-ing verbatim: \n",
       "\"It's an internal revolution since we've hired about thirty people, including a dozen IT developers with a very start-up like structure. I think we came across three or four solu-tions that we evaluated, tested; we tested in particular two of them to see how it could work, how it worked and whether it was simple or not. \"(Network Franchisor 10).We can therefore see that in both cases the network mobilised its absorption capacity to search for solutions outside the network and then integrated this information into the network, whether by looking for manufacturers or by hiring new employees. \n",
       "As with the adaptability of high-performance networks with DCs, the absorption capacity is once again at the origin of the franchisor who will take the steps to acquire new ma-chines in the case of nnetwork 9 or start a recruitment process in the case of network 10.\n",
       "A second difference between our two categories of networks lies in the capacity for inno-vation. Successful networks and DC holders have the capacity for innovation. It simply manifests itself by the creation of new products or services by the network. \n",

       "We note that the capacity for innovation is mostly developed by networks with a competi-tive advantage and DCs, because a single network without DCs but with a competitive advantage also develops a capacity for innovation. The lack of absorption capacity in networks with a competitive advantage but without DCs prevents them from developing a capacity for innovation. As mentioned above, several factors such as the sector or the presence of internal knowledge can explain this lack of absorption capacity. \n",
       "We can therefore think that the combination of the adaptive and absorptive capacities favours the development of the innovation capacity. The addition of new knowledge to the network actually allows the network to develop new products/services. \n",
       "5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n",
       "One of the questions addressed in the research was to determine the nature of DCs with regard to the capacity for innovation by mobilising the approach of Wang and Ahmed (2007). Several perspectives are in confrontation with regard to their nature. While some think that innovation capacity and DCs are synonymous, others such as Wang and Ahmed, (2007) suggest that innovation capacity is a component of DC. Indeed, Parashar and Singh, (2005) argue that the innovative capacity relies on DCs in particular because they facilitate the ability to adapt to change through innovation (Hill and Rothaermel, 2003). Wang and Ahmed, (2007) consider that DCs consist of adaptive capacity, absorp-tive capacity and innovation capacity. Our results show that the networks in our sample with competitive advantage and DCs also have a capacity for innovation as well as the ability to adapt and absorb. We can the-refore think that innovative capacity is, as Wang and Ahmed, (2007) suggest, a com-ponent of DCs. On the other hand, we consider that innovation capacity and DCs are not synonymous since our results show that one of the networks in our sample has the capaci-ty to innovate without developing DCs. Moreover, these same authors suggest that the capacities of adaptation, absorption and innovation that make up DCs are connected. Our results also point in this direction. Indeed, according to our results, the adaptive capacity triggers the absorption capacity of the franchisor and the innovation capacity seems to be the result of the mobilization of these two capacities with the production of a new product or a new service of the network. Our research also shows that it is possible for franchise networks to perform well over the long term without owning DCs. This result is in line with the literature on the ambiguous relationship between DCs and competitive advantage (Chaharmahali and Siadat, 2010; Krzakiewicz, 2013). While some works such as those of Teece et al, (1997) and Augier and Teece, (2009) suggest that DCs lead to competitive advantage, our results show that DCs are not always necessary to obtain it. In fact, several networks in our sample do not own DCs, and yet they perform well. This can be explained in particular by the adaptabil-ity developed by these networks, which is based on close relationships between the fran-chisor and the franchisees. As Cox and Mason suggest, (2007) franchisees are indeed a source of ideas for the network through their interactions with local customers. Moreover, the relationship between the franchisor and its franchisees plays a particular role in pro-moting the dissemination of innovations within the network and encouraging franchisees to adopt new products (Cliquet and Nguyen, 2004). The franchisor cannot impose new innovations on its franchisees. The franchisor must then convince rather than coerce (Al-lix-Desfautaux et al., 2014). It is therefore essential for the franchisor to maintain quality relationships with its franchisees, particularly because franchisees may be reluctant to adopt certain innovations, especially when they are initiated by the franchisor (Ibid.). This leads us to discuss our findings on the absorption capacity of franchise networks. \n",
       "Absorption capacity only appears in our second category of networks, i.e. networks with a competitive advantage and DCs. Our results highlight the importance of absorption ca-pacity in franchise networks. Indeed, it takes a lot of effort on the part of the franchisor to disseminate the new product or service throughout the entire network due to the geo-graphical disparities that may exist. Indeed, the mobilisation of the absorption capacity by the franchisor alone is not sufficient to ensure the durability of the network. The fran-chisor must ensure that the absorbed knowledge is passed on to all its franchisees, despite the geographical disparities, with the aim of offering a standardised product or service to customers. To do so, the franchisor can rely on various means such as training, annual meetings or regional meetings. Allix-Desfautaux et al, (2014) note that training is an ef-fective way to overcome the resistance of some franchisees. \n",
       "Our findings are consistent with the discussions stating that DCs can, however, foster competitive advantage (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016). Indeed, we believe that DCs promote competitive advantage, particularly because networks that have a competitive advantage and DCs develop more absorptive and inno-vative capacities than networks that do not hold any. Therefore we believe that the inno-vation capacity is the result of the mobilization of adaptive and absorptive capacities.\n",

Exploring leadership gender and risk taking in franchise firms. Abstract Drawing on the previous literature, we suggest that male leaders make risky decisions to a greater extent than female leaders in the context of the Spanish franchise. We test for these gender differences in the real context of franchise systems and analyse the interaction between gender and other observable factors through univariate analyses. We used the chain discontinuation rate for a three-year period (2015-2017) to directly analyse how the franchisors leaders behave in terms of risk. Our results are in line with what is suggested by the large body of literature that states that women are more risk averse than men. In addition, we found interesting contexts where these gender differences do not hold true. In particular, we find that male and female leaders seem to operate with the same level of risk-taking behavior in the B2B as opposed to the B2C sector and in large firms as opposed to small firms. Theoretically, we posit this may be a function of two possible routes: first that women leaders take less risks in B2C sectors as they seek act on behalf of customers they represent and second that increased social pressure that male and female leaders may experience within large firm settings to operate in line with norms when it comes to risk taking: which may decrease risk-taking in male leaders and increase risk-taking in female leaders. Finally, our exploration of risk taking suggested that both male and female leaders will take more risks as they gain more experience as leaders, suggesting that risk-taking may be an important skill that is learned in leadership. This study contributes to the field of strategic decisions, risk in senior leadership, and the literature on franchises and gender, and formulates interesting future lines of research related to risk in franchises. Key words: Risk; discontinuation rate; gender differences; franchise; leadership. LITERATURE REVIEW Gender differences in risk management The fine line that separates success from failure in business is largely determined by proper risk management and the ability to optimally balance organizational and financial decisions. There is broad agreement on the difference in risk behaviours between men and women. This gender gap in financial decision making tends to tip the balance toward risk- taking for men and aversion for women. This assumption has been corroborated by the literature from different disciplines and theoretical approaches (Byrnes et al., 1999; Borghans et al., 2009; Croson & Gneezy, 2009; Charness & Gneezy, 2012; Zhu et al., 2021). Arguments from the biological area of human behaviour attribute these differences in risk management to hormonal origins. For example, Cronqvist et al., (2016) found that a greater presence of prenatal testosterone is related to the masculinization of financial behaviour, which affects the assumption of risk in decision making during adulthood. This is in line with studies that have shown that a greater presence of testosterone increases the chances of experiencing risky behaviours in the management of financial affairs (Cueva et al., 2015; Apicella et al., 2014; Chicaiza-Becerra & Garcia-Molina, 2017). When examining a sample of 98 men, Apicella et al., (2008) found that risk-taking is positively correlated with saliva testosterone levels and facial masculinity. Specifically, they found that men with higher levels of testosterone invested almost 12% more of their portfolio in a financial game than men with average levels of testosterone. These results are maintained in the study by Nofsinger et al., (2018) who show that within a competitive environment, high levels of testosterone imply a greater assumption of risk compared to a non-competitive environment. Making optimal economic decisions is a necessary action to achieve wealth, and therefore, high social status as well. Testosterone works in individuals as a facilitator to achieve that economic status by favouring risk taking, which increases the chances of obtaining greater wealth (Stanton, 2017). Thereby, hormone levels function as adaptive survival mechanisms within the business context by significantly influencing the cognitive processes that affect financial decision making (Coates et al., 2010). In relation to cognitive processes, in the area of psychology, there are numerous theoretical approaches that offer alternative explanations about the differences that men and women present in risk assessment. Within the cognitive psychology literature, several investigations have evidenced the influence of positive and negative affects on risk-taking (Mano, 1992, 1994; Lawton et al., 2007; Delgado-García et al., 2010; Janssen et al., 2010; al., 2018). Whilst positive affects influence the perception of reality in an optimistic way, negative affects tend to draw a less idealized and more pessimistic reality, focusing on loss rather than gain. As a result of this cognitive process, individuals tend to select the riskiest decision when positive affects predominate, and, on the contrary, when negative affects prevail (Delgado-García et al., 2010). Jacobsen et al., (2014), using data from large surveys, find that men are more oriented towards optimistic thinking about the future performance of the stock market; whilst women present a higher degree of pessimism and perception of risk. Furthermore, these results are maintained after taking into account sociodemographic variables such as income level, education or country of origin. These results are in line with the findings of Dominitz & Manski (2007), who observed that men present more optimistic beliefs than women regarding the returns of stocks in the following year. In line with this approach, the literature on behavioural finance delves into the deviations from perceptions based on rational models (Rajdev & Raninga, 2016). These deviations in perception are known as cognitive biases. Cognitive biases have been defined by Simon et al., (2000, p. 113) as: “common types of mental shortcuts used to make judgments”. These authors point to three types of cognitive biases that may influence underestimation of risk: overconfidence, the illusion of control, and belief in the law of small numbers. This last bias manifests itself when decisions are made based on limited information. One of the main conclusions from this study is that the cognitive processes that encourage individuals to start a business are the same ones that influence their poor performance. Hence, these cognitive bias are also associated with business failure. This is closely related to the negative consequences of risky decisions; which women tend to focus on when evaluating the gain-loss relationship (Beckmann et al., 2011). In an analysis of the literature on behavioural finance Rajdev & Raninga (2016) find that there are different behavioural biases that are related to personality traits and gender psychology. Whilst male investors suffer from an overconfidence bias and tend to think that they are more competent than women, female investors suffer from herding, hindsight and anchoring bias. These biases are often enhanced by certain personality traits. In the case of women, empathy, socialization and extraversion influence their orientation to imitate the behaviours of others instead of taking certain risks when making financial decisions. On the other hand, the combination of cognitive psychology with neuroscience offers a useful theoretical approach to understand human behaviour in terms of risk management. Slovic et al., (2004) suggest that the rational system is based on formal logic, whilst the experiential system is based on intuition and association. According to the authors, both of them work in parallel, depending on each other. This means that assumption and aversion to risk obey the interrelation between emotion and reason, which, as the authors point out, is the key of the rational behaviour. Gender differences in franchise risk Although the gender gap on economic risk has been repeatedly evidenced in the financial context through the study of preferences and perceptions (see for example, Finucane et al., 2000; Dohmen et al., 2011; Almenberg & Dreber, 2015), it is not so evident a priory that this behaviour pattern is replicated to the same extent in the real context of companies (Brooks et al., 2019). To provide evidence in this regard, it is convenient to analyse a real context where risk can be directly observed through the decisions made by higher-level leaders. In this study we propose to study risk in the context of the franchise since it presents adequate analytical conditions to evaluate leadership decisions at the chain level. Some of the main characteristics of the franchise such as the highly competitive context, the homogeneity in organizational terms and the breadth of the market and client portfolio; make the franchise model an ideal scenario for the analysis of strategic decisions faced by leading franchisors in terms of risk. The studies that have tackled the risk in franchising, mainly focus on the role of franchisee leaders and the factors that influence the perception of risk. For example, Grace & Weaven (2011) find that the risk assessment and satisfaction of franchisees are determined by perceptions of emotional and monetary value. In the case of women, a higher perception of monetary value is associated with a lower perception of risk. In line with the perceptions of the leaders, Meek et al., (2014) find that the levels of trust in the franchisor-franchisee relationship differ between genders. Specifically, they observe that women have a lower level of trust in franchisees than men, which, according to the authors, might be related to their tendency to aversion to risk. In a recent study, Thaichon et al., (2020) point out that certain factors such as the balance between work and family life and the characteristics of the franchise sector, among others, influence the selection of the franchise business model by part of the franchised women. This decision is determined by the different levels at which women are willing to take risk. Whilst there is some evidence on the factors that may influence risk perception among franchise leaders; it is less clear how franchise leaders behave in terms of risks in the real context. Based on the above discussion, it makes sense to argue that male franchisors are geared towards taking more risk than female franchisors. Nevertheless, in this study we go one step further by assessing the factors that can skew risk decisions among male leaders. Determinants in the risk assumption of male franchisors Drawing on the literature on organizational behaviour, we identified four factors that may influence the risk pattern that male leaders are willing to assume. Furthermore, we maintain the assumption about gender differences persist in all cases, assuming more risk in the case of men than in that of women. Leader´s age Within the individual context, we identify age as a factor of valuable interest in making organizational decisions that involve risk. Previous evidence has shown that as individuals get older they become more risk averse (Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2003; Herrmann & Datta, 2006; Croci et al., 2017). Lee & Moon (2016) argue that when older senior managers have reached a certain economic status, they are not willing to take risks fearful of losing this social position. For example, Croci et al., (2017) using a sample of US oil and gas companies, found strong evidence on risk aversion behaviour present in CEOs approaching retirement age. These results were also confirmed in the analysis of corporate policies; Serfling (2014) showed that older CEOs tend to reduce the company's risk through less risky investment policies. Additionally, older CEOs also invest less in R&D, lean toward diversification policies, and maintain lower operating leverage. Therefore, the age of the leader is negatively related to risk taking. We prompt that this behaviour will also occur in the context of the franchise. Specifically, we suggest that gender differences in risk assumption persist in favour of men only for the sample of young leaders. On the other hand, within the organizational context, there are variables of special importance in the franchise industry such as: the sector, the size and the age of the chain. B2C and B2B sectors The literature on the organizational area of the company has indicated that the trend towards a riskier behaviour, for example, towards innovation, the digital context or the adoption of green corporate strategies, differs between sectors: B2C (oriented to the final consumer) and B2B (oriented to the commercial customer) (Frambach & Schillewaert, 2002; Gabriel & Nyshadham, 2008; Hoejmose et al., 2012). Paluch & Wünderlich (2016), through qualitative interviews, find that customers in the B2B sector are reluctant to services based on high-risk technology. The findings of this study reveal that persistent personal and psychological fear in clients in this sector prevents them from using technology-based services. Therefore, there is a widespread rejection of innovation and risk in the commercial customer-oriented (B2B) sector. In a study on corporate reputation, Brammer et al., (2009) using a sample of large companies in the UK, found that companies operating in B2C sectors are more flexible in assessing gender diversity on the board directive. Specifically, the findings revealed that the presence of women on the board of directors improves corporate reputation, particularly in sectors oriented to the final customer (B2C). Thereby, the empirical evidence supports that the B2C sector presents a behavioural tendency towards change, flexibility and risk in different strategic areas; while the B2B sector is more airtight and inflexible and tends to establish strategies that reduce the level of risk. In short, the most important reason that the literature supports is that risk is not well seen by customers in the B2B sector, whilst it is valued positively by customers in the B2C sector. We expect to find similar behaviour in the context of the franchise. Specifically, we suggest that it is the B2C sector that presents gender differences on risk. Thereby, we do not expect find them in the B2B sector. Chain´s size On the other hand, from the Resource-Based Perspective (Barney, 1991) we find a solid theoretical argument to suggest that larger companies with more years of experience have greater potential to generate a sustained competitive advantage. For this reason, larger and more experienced companies are more predisposed than smaller and less experienced companies to make decisions that involve a high-level of risk. Thus, risk-taking behaviour at the organizational level manifests itself as the disposition to strategic resources becomes more evident. A study on supply chains and risk by Finch (2004) corroborated that large companies increase their exposure to risk due to the creation of inter-organizational networks. In other words, having strategic partners such as SMEs in the supply chain increases the risk exposure of large companies. At the same time there is a trend towards risk taking in large companies; Ellegaard (2008) shows a contrary behaviour pattern in small companies. The results of this study reveal that small-sized supply chains use a defensive approach to managing risk. In other words, small companies tend to take less risk and protect themselves by applying relational practices with their suppliers. Following this approach, we foresee that the size of the chains will influence the assumption of risk. Specifically, we propose that gender differences be maintained, only in the sample of large chains. Chain´s experience This same behavioural standard occurs when organizational experience is taken into account, in terms of number of years operating. For example, Hahn et al., (2009) using a data set on patents in 55 countries, find that learning through experience leads to the search for greater risk. The findings suggest that companies can learn from their own experiences and process this knowledge in a way that prompts them to explore environments of greater complexity and uncertainty. These findings are in line with the literature on organizational management and internationalization (Li, 1995; Hahn, 2009) that suggests that companies benefit from learning acquired through experience. This knowledge can be transferred to other markets and unfamiliar contexts where risk is perceived positively compared to companies with no prior experience (Duke/Archstone, 2005). In this sense, the experience can be considered a valuable and inimitable resource from the Resource Based Perspective. Therefore, it makes sense to think that, in franchise chains, where the concept of “know- how” or knowledge transfer arises (Perrigot et al., 2017), the higher level of experience of the chain is related to a greater assumption risk. Therefore, we expect to find the same standard of gender differences over risk only for the sample of chains with a high-level of experience. STATEMENT OF HYPOTHESES Drawing on the previous theoretical base that includes biological and psychological approaches on risk preference by men and assumption by women; we propose the main hypothesis of the study: H1: Franchise chains run by male leaders take more risk than those run by female leaders. Then, based on the previous literature on approaches to organizational behaviour, we suggest that certain factors may influence the pattern of risk present in male leaders. Therefore, we propose the following study hypotheses: H2: The interaction between the age and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. H3: The interaction between the sector and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. H4: The interaction between the chain's size and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. H5: The interaction between the franchising experience and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains. METHODOLOGY Data collection and Measures This study has been carried out within the Spanish franchise market. All the data relating to the profile of the franchisor leader, the chain's organizational context and the economic dimension of the risk come from an online survey addressed to all franchisors who are members of the Spanish Franchise Association (“AEF” as per its Spanish acronym). This directory of franchises is the most important in the country since it brings together all the franchisors that carry out activities in Spain. Furthermore, all of them are committed to complying with the standards of the European Code of Ethics for Franchising. In another line of affairs, the AEF is part of the European Franchise Federation (EFF) which is the main advocate of the franchise industry in Europe. Therefore, all franchisor members associated with the AEF represent the most relevant and comprehensive set of franchise chains in terms of economic and ethical business conduct. During the data collection period, in 2017, the Spanish franchise system had 1,348 brands, of which 82.8% were of national origin and 17.2% of international origin (Spanish Franchise Association, 2018). Currently, the franchise system is made up of 1,381 national and international brands, which indicates a slight increase in the number of operating entities, despite the current turbulent times (Spanish Franchise Association, 2020). The data collection method used is in line with other research on franchising that has also used national business directories as the main source for the sample selection of franchise systems (see: Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012 in the German market; Perrigot et al., 2015 in the French market). The final sample consisted of a total of 246 Spanish franchise companies. Respondents were the managing directors of the franchise companies, who are responsible for setting standards in the franchise networks. Of the 246 companies, 183 of them had a male leader and 63 had a female leader. In addition, 174 companies were from the B2C sector, and 72 from the B2B sector (see Appendix A for more a full summary of sample demographics). Chain Risk Measure. We measure the risk assumed by franchise chains through the chain's discontinuation rate for a period of three years (2013-2017). Several authors point out that the choice to break up a project or business that has implied a considerable initial investment implies a high risk for the companies (Cazier, 2011; Lu and Wang, 2018; Yeoh & Hooy, 2020). Hence, the decision to discontinue an establishment in a franchise chain implies the assumption of the risk of loss of the initial investments involved in setting up and developing such establishment. This indicator has been used in the literature on risk management (Watson & Everett, 1996; Everett & Watson, 1998) and recommended by experts in the franchise arena such as Lafontaine (1992), who   points out that this index has an advantage over measures based on the variation of sales in the risk measurement. The decision to discontinue an establishment depends to a greater extent on the franchisor than on the franchisees. The final decision to discontinue or continue an establishment, through company-owned management or the appointment of another franchisee, is ultimately up to the franchisor. Thus, a high discontinuation rate will indicate that franchisors assume a greater degree of risk at the chain level. Gender. This study considered two genders of leaders (male and female) identified by the respondents. Several control variables were included to analyse the interaction between gender and certain factors that can influence the risk assumed by franchise leaders. Leader´s age. (i.e., an individual characteristic of the leader) that was measured through the age of the leader grouped into two main categories: franchisors leaders in young age (Up to 50 years) and franchisors leaders in mature age (50 years and over). Then, we analyse the control variables referring to the organizational context. Sector. First of all, we take into account the sector to which the franchise chain belongs. Based on the sectorial classification of franchises offered by the Spanish Franchise Association, each franchise subsector was referenced with its corresponding category: B2C (subsectors that directly target the customer or the final consumer) or B2B (subsectors focusing on business-to-business transactions). Chain´s size. Second, we analyse the size of the franchise chain as another main control variable. The size of the chain was measured through the count of the number of establishments that include own establishments and franchised establishments during theend of 2017. This variable was grouped into two main categories: small chains (up to 49 establishments) and large chains (50 establishments or more). Chain´s experience. Finally, the chain's level of experience was measured by the number of years that the franchise chains had been franchising (a minimum of five years was considered). As in the previous cases, we divide the level of franchising experience into two main groups: chains with a low level of franchising experience (Up to 14 years) and chains with a high level of franchising experience (Over 15 years). (See Appendix A for more detail on control variable information). ANALYSIS AND RESULTS To analyse the gender differences on the risk in which franchise chains participate, one- way ANOVA tests were run with a bias corrected accelerated bootstrapping procedure of 5,000 samples. Results from ANOVA show a significant difference between genders, in which male leaders show a higher discontinuation rate than women, that is, we find empirical support for Hypothesis 1 which states that: “Franchise chains run by male leaders take more risk than those run by female leaders”; F (8.221)=1, p=0.005 =0.033, Mm=0.382 [0.02;0.17] (SD=0.799); Mf=0.086 [0.27;0.50] (SD=0.299) (see Table 1). [Table 1 about here] When testing the effects of the interaction between gender and each of the control variables, we found a behaviour deviation in the risk in which men participate. In the first place, when taking into account the age of the leader variable, we find that male leaders again exceed female leaders in the discontinuation rate, but it is young male leaders who present gender differences in the risk, which is in line with what was formulated in Hypothesis 2: “The interaction between the age and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(4.737)=1, p=0.032 =0.039 (in the young leaders sample) Mm=0.357 [0.19;0.55] (SD=0.854); Mf=0.030 [0.00;0.10] (SD=0.174) (see Table 2). [Table 2 about here] Next, we analyse the gender differences taking into account the chain sector (B2B and B2C) and we find that male leaders exceed female leaders in the discontinuation rate only in the B2C sector, which provides empirical support to the Hypothesis 3 which stated that: “The interaction between the sector and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(8.961)=1, p=0.003 =0.050 (in the B2C sample) Mm=0.392 [0.26;0.53] (SD=0.767); Mf=0.044 [0.00;0.11] (SD=0.208) (see Table 3). [Table 3 about here] Interestingly, when exploring gender differences in chain´s size individually, we find that male leaders present more risk than female leaders, solely in the small franchise chains, which is in line with the interaction effect raised by Hypothesis 4: “The interaction between the chain´s size and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(7.764)=,1 p=0.006 =0.044 (in the small franchise chain sample) Mm=0.421 [0.28;0.58] (SD=0.871); Mf=0.047 [0.00;0.12] (SD=0.213) (see Table 4). [Table 4 about here] Finally, when we evaluate the gender differences taking into account the chain's level of franchising experience, we find that chains with a high level of chain´s experience present gender differences with respect to risk, which offers empirical support for Hypothesis 5: “The interaction between the franchising experience and the gender of the leader influences the risk taken in franchise chains”; F(4.667)=1, p=0.033 =0.039 (in the sample of high level of chain´s experience) Mm=0.637 [0.44;0.85] (SD=1.001); Mf=0.184 [0.04;0.37] (SD=0.427) (see Table 5). [Table 5 about here] DISCUSSION The behaviour of male and female leaders differs in everything related to risk management. Exploring the limits of this behaviour has become a matter of enormous interest to the scientific community by different academic disciplines. The vast body of the existing literature recognizes that men are willing to take more risk than women. This result has been repeated in most of the research through the analysis of individual perceptions and preferences on various financial matters that involve risk decisions. Nevertheless, there is not as much empirical evidence on how male and female leaders behave in the real environment within the organizational and strategic context (Brooks et al., 2019). We identify the franchise environment as an ideal analysis environment for observing the risk decisions made by the highest managers of the chain, the franchisor leaders. Following Lafontaine (1992), we evaluate the risk assumed by leading franchisors through the chain's discontinuation rate over a three-year period, which offers key information on the risk of loss of the initial investment. The closure rate is a widely accepted indicator for evaluating business risk (Everett & Watson, 1998) since the closure of an establishment implies the loss of a good part of the investment previously made in said establishment. In other words, when an establishment closes, a significant part of the investment made in that establishment is lost. Therefore, the higher the closing rate of a chain, the greater the risk of loss assumed by the chain. There is a behavioural tendency to continue investing in a business even knowing that it is not working. This is related to the cognitive biases of individuals and the process of selection and interpretation of the available information. As pointed out by Delgado-García et al., (2010), although decision makers use elements or benchmarks to assess the risk of elections, these leaders may present deviations in their tendency to risk. This is due to the systematic use of heuristics during the decision making process. According to Gowda (1999, p. 63): \"people rely on several important and systematic shortcuts when making judgments about the probabilities of events.\" As a result, individuals use their heuristics to facilitate decision making based on their actual preferences. Tversky & Kahneman (1981) point out that these preferences come from individual cognitive frames and can vary in a predictable way depending on how the same problem is framed. Therefore, the unconscious preference towards risk assumption or aversion is key in the decision to close or cease the business. In this study we consider the role of gender on the risk assumed by the leaders of franchise chains in the real environment in which they operate. In addition, we identified a series of personal factors, such as the leader's age and organizational factors, such as the sector, size and experience of the chain, which may divert the risk-taking behaviour present in male leaders. Our results are in line with established theory and in all cases we observe that men present a higher discontinuation rate than women. This means that male leaders are willing to take more risk of losing the initial investment than female leaders. These results support the main hypothesis of the study (H1). Then, when we include the control variables such as the age of the leader, the sector, the size and the experience of the chain, we found interesting findings on the deviations in male risk-taking behaviour. In relation to the personal variable, the age of the leader, our results corroborate that the age of the leader influences holding at risk and specifically; it is young men who assume more risk than women. No gender differences are observed for the sample of adult franchisor leaders, which is in line with expectations (H2). Within the group of variables that include the organizational characteristics of the chains, we observe that there is a greater assumption of risk in the chains that operate in the B2C sector and the chains with a high-level of experience. In both cases, the hypotheses previously raised that predicted a greater assumption of risk by men than women are fulfilled (H3 and H5). Nonetheless, a surprising result is revealed in these analyses, which refers to the size of the chain in relation to the H4. Contrary to expectations, smaller chains have a higher discontinuation rate than larger chains. That is, men who run small chains take more risk than those who run large chains. This finding, while surprising, is in line with some of the life cycle and technology literature that suggests that, during the experimentation stage, companies are willing to assume a high degree of uncertainty (Markard, 2020). Therefore, taking risk in the early stages of creation is related to the purpose of growth. It is interesting to note that, despite observing a higher discontinuation rate in small chains than in large chains; the same does not happen when we analyse the experience level of the chains. This is due to the results revealed about the franchising experience (H5) where chains with a higher level of experience take more risks than chains with a low-level of experience. Thus, it is possible to think that there may be small chains with a lot of experience that have not yet grown in size. Therefore, these chains may be willing to take risks to continue growing and for this reason they present a higher rate of discontinuity. Meanwhile, other chains may be large, but have little franchising experience. These chains may have grown very fast and their low-level of experience prevents them from taking any further risks. As a result of this rapid growth without sufficient prior experience, they have a lower discontinuation rate. In another line of explanations, Everett & Watson (1998) point out that size limits small companies to diversify risk and this forces them to risk more to achieve their growth goal. Therefore, our unexpected finding would also make sense under this line of reasoning. In short, in all the analyses carried out, including the individual and organizational factors, the same pattern of behaviour towards risk-taking by male leadership is repeated. Therefore, our results provide empirical support for the bulk of the literature that suggests the existence of a prominent gap between gender and business risk. In addition, they do it, evaluating the risk of the decisions made in the context of the franchise. Namely, we analyse the real context and taking a step beyond the analysis based on psychological perceptions or preferences. CONCLUSIONS, FUTURE RESEARCH LINES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY Our results contribute to the field of strategic decisions, risk in the upper echelons leadership and the franchise and gender literature by examining in-depth how franchisor leaders behave in terms of risk taking within the real economic context at the chain level. We found that male leaders present a higher discontinuation rate than female leaders, which reveals a greater assumption of risk. We observe that this pattern of behaviour is continually repeated taking into account variables of interest such as the age of the leader and others related to the organizational field such as the sector where they operate (B2B and B2C), the size and level of experience of the chain. Additionally, an interesting finding reveals that there are gender differences in risk in favour of men, only in small chains, instead of large chains as we expected to find. Nonetheless, the same does not happen when we evaluate the chain's level of experience, where chains with a higher level of experience present gender differences in risk. This result raises a question of future academic interest, which could be to analyse the life cycle and growth speed of franchise chains, which may influence the risk assumed by the franchisor leadership. In terms of evaluating the risk in which franchise chains participate, this study offers an alternative to measure questionnaires based on opinion or perception of risk by using data on the discontinuation rate of franchise chains for a period of three years. Future research could address the behavioural differences in risk that franchise chains participate by using this indicator and analysing other variables that may influence leadership gender. For example, within the context of the family franchise, it would be of great interest to observe whether the pattern of risk-taking behaviour for men and aversion for women is repeated through generations of franchisor leaders. Future research could also address whether the risk of closure of establishments in a given franchise chain is related to the gender of the franchisees. Finally, we acknowledge that the study has limitations, for example, in relation to being conducted within one geographical location (in one country). We believe that this limitation offers researchers fruitful opportunities for further research, by applying the theories and analysis to broader contexts. No Love for I Heart Mac & Cheese Joyce A.

McIntyre, University of West Georgia This critical incident was prepared by the authors and is intended to be used as a basis for class discussion.  The views presented here are those of the authors based on their professional judgment.    IntroductionElizabeth Torres reviewed the documents sent to her from the Phillips, Cantor and Shalek law firm in October 2020.  The Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC, (i.e., the franchisor) was suing her and her partner, Cory Attardo, for loan default involving their two I Heart Mac and Cheese locations (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  The franchisor also pursued unspecified monetary damages from Torres related to an email she sent in September (Ewen, 2020b).  She had twenty days to respond to the lawsuit.   The Relationship History Founded in 2016, I Heart Mac and Cheese was “a fast-casual restaurant concept specializing in customizable, made to order macaroni and cheese bowls and grilled cheese sandwiches” (I Heart Mac & Cheese, 2020).  Stephen Giordanella, CEO of the Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, stated “It’s a very inexpensive franchise to get into.  It’s created for the family that may have a little equity in their home, where they could take out a second mortgage, and get into their own business and control their own destiny as a family.” (Maze, 2020).  Entrepreneur Magazinenamed the concept a “top new franchise” in 2019, and USA Today placed it in the “10 best fast-casual restaurants” in 2020 (Maze, 2020).   Each prospective franchisee paid a nonrefundable $35,000 franchise fee and upon opening continued to pay the franchisor through a percentage of gross sales comprised of 5% royalty fees, up to 3% brand fund contributions, and at least 1% local advertising fees (I Heart Mac & Cheese, 2020).  The initial franchisee agreement ran for ten years with an option for renewal.  Prospective franchisees also needed to show liquid capital of $75,000, secure a location, and obtain financing to cover a total investment that ranged from $251,000 to $464,500 depending on the geographic location (Maze, 2020).  The franchisor stated in 2020 that it had franchised over 100 locations to date (Ewen, 2020a), however, as of mid-October only thirteen locations (five company-owned and eight franchised) were in operation (Maze, 2020). On April 9, 2019, Torres and Attardo purchased two existing I Heart Mac and Cheese restaurants in New York that were then owned and operated by the franchisor.  Torres and Attardo agreed to a purchase price of $463,167 for the Patchague location and $306,088 for the Bayside location.  After the initial down payments, they signed two promissory notes with the franchisor for the remaining purchase price balances of $231,583 and $230,838, respectively.  The two locations came fully furnished with existing “furniture, fixtures, cooking, cooling and heating equipment, computer equipment, inventory, televisions, monitors, flooring, wall coverings, décor components, computer hardware, other tangible property… sales and promotional literature, client lists, and other marketing or service-related materials” (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).Torres and Attardo seemed successful with their two locations until the Covid-19 pandemic struck the New York City metropolitan area in early March 2020.  New York soon became the U.S. epicenter of the disease and its governor shut down all indoor dining statewide (Sutton, 2020), and both locations remained closed throughout the summer.  On April 1, Torres and Attardo failed to pay their required monthly promissory payments of $4,585 for Patchague and $2,350 for Bayside, and on May 1, no payment once again was submitted for the Bayside location (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  As a result, the franchisor agreed to accept half payments from the Patchague location of $2,292 for April and May deferring the remaining amount across the last six months of the year; for Bayside, the franchisor agreed to defer the two months of missed payments across the next four months (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  However, Torres and Attardo failed again to make the full renegotiated payment amounts for both locations (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  Payment ceased in August for Bayside, and they unilaterally closed the location.  Patchague closed in September, and all payments stopped.  By October, $37,413 was past due.Decision Time for TorresTorres read through the exhibits in the lawsuit.  Besides the expected copies of the franchise purchase agreements and promissory notes, a chain of six emails (shown in Table 1) involving Torres and eight other individuals (most unnamed) about formatting a letter of intent for a franchisee was included (Mac and Cheese Franchise Group, LLC v Elizabeth Torres and Cory Attardo, 2020).  The last email was the source of the Mac and Cheese Franchise Group claims of slander, libel, defamation, and tortious interference in a business relationship against Torres.                                 Table 1: Email Chain – Re: IHeartMac&Cheese – LOI template for California franchisee August 20, 2020 At 3:32 p.m.  – Whitney Dutton, a real estate advisor based in Florida wrote: “Funny, I just got a draft of mine today for a site we are submitting on.

At 5:28 p.m.  – Elizabeth Torres replied: “From corporate nothing was granted as relief… my landlords did however offer a reduction in rent and are allowing me time to catch up but not all my locations are surviving this.   We are still struggling hard in NY” September 11, 2020  At 7:14 a.m.  – Whitney Dutton wrote: “We are close to coming to agreement with landlord.   Here is the basis of our LOI negotiations.

I have to close my two NY locations and there is not a way to make money on these with the franchise fees and food costs rising… this is a scam and lawsuits are pending against corporate\" The franchisor was involved in several lawsuits with former franchisees (Maze, 2020).  For example, Genevieve Prieto opened an Oklahoma location in 2018, but it closed within 8 months (Ewen, 2020a).  She accused the franchisor of selling a business concept that was unprofitable.  The lawsuit included several accusations including illegal financial performance representations; she was told sales in the flagship restaurant in Florida were $700,000, but documents revealed sales of less than $300,000 (Ewen, 2020c).  In October 2020, the franchisor sent her a “cease and desist” notice claiming she had defamed the brand (Ewen, 2020a).  Kim Grotz and her husband opened a location in Georgia in 2019, but it closed within 5 months (Maze, 2020).  Her lawsuit accused the franchisor of using equipment that she leased from a third party.  Gordanella expressed some empathy, but blamed the failed franchisees, stating “I feel terrible for people who aren’t successful.  It’s like any business.  You have to work it hard” (Maze, 2020).   Regardless, dozens of prospective franchisees, such as Vinny Greco in New York, continued to sign up in 2020, willing to take the risk despite the lawsuits.  Greco stated that “We’re willing right now to take a one-store gamble…” (Ewen, 2020a).  Torres knew she had just joined the list of lawsuits.  What course of action should she take in response to the franchisor’s legal action?A CROSS-NATIONAL STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE CONSUMERS Massiel Carolina Henriquez Parodi PhD Research Fellow University of Agder University of Udine Kristiansand, Norway massiel.henriquez@uia.noIlan Alon Professor University of Agder Kristiansand, Norway ilan.alon@uia.no Michela Cesarina Mason Associate Professor University of Udine Udine, Italy michela.mason@uniud.it Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference  USC Business School May 24-26, 2021 A CROSS-NATIONAL STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE CONSUMERS Abstract This paper studies the behavioral intentions of global restaurant consumers and the mediating role of their perception of value in 15 countries: Austria, Italy, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, France, Spain, Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Thailand and Russia.  The international restaurant franchise studied in this paper has standardized to a great extent its operations, marketing strategy,  atmospheric elements and its products and services globally. This paper analyses to what extent the standardization of the servicescape and quality elements of international franchise restaurants are effective and whether or not atmospheric and quality elements of a food retailer have a positive influence in the value perception, and ultimately, in the behavioral intentions of its international consumers. Furthermore, we study whether or not there are significant differences between consumers from emerging and developed countries. Drawing from the Spence et al., (2014) framework and using structural equation modelling, we found that the visual, auditory and environmental servicescape elements together with the quality of products and services offered by the company, have a positive influence in the perceived value and behavioral intentions of international restaurant consumers. Furthermore, when comparing differences between emerging and developed countries through a multigroup analysis, we found that service quality and lighting have a different effect in value perceptions and patronage intentions of consumers in these markets, therefore fast-food restaurant managers should reconsider the standardization of these elements when internationalizing in these markets.  Key words: standardization, food retail atmospherics, international franchising, global brand, consumer behavior. A cross-national study of international franchise consumers Introduction Business format franchising consists of a contractual agreement between two firms, the franchisor and the franchisee, where the franchisee pays the franchisor for the right to sell the franchisor products, using its trademark and business format during a specific period of time (Blair & Lafontaine, 2005). Franchising has been widely used as an internationalization strategy for MNEs in service industries, especially in the hotel, restaurant, retail and general service industries (Alon et al., 2020).  Service industries are suited for franchising because their knowledge is codifiable and replicable (Brouthers and Hennart, 2007) which allows standardization and consistent quality through franchise contracts (Hennart, 2019) and facilitates benefiting from economies of scale (Fladmoe-Linquist and Jacque, 1995). Firm standardization has two different levels of centrality in the business strategy. These levels are divided in core and peripheral elements (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999). In franchising, the core elements are those that are central for the operation and survival of the business and its standardization should be system wide (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999). Peripheral elements are those where the benefits of standardization can be balanced with the benefits of local adaptation (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999).  McDonalds is one of the best examples of a successful franchise company that has become a leading firm and has steadily been among the top global brands. One of its key characteristics is that it uses a franchising to expand domestically in the United States and a strategy for internationalization. Therefore, nearly all its operations and products are standardized, and they maintain high standardization levels across their franchise system compared with other fast-food franchises (Kaufman and Eroglu, 1999). The fact that they offer nearly the same key products in all countries, as well has having nearly the same service scape, services and procedures, times and movements in all countries where the company is present. This brings the question: Is the perception of the atmospheric characteristics and food and service quality of an international franchise restaurant affecting the value perception of its global consumers? Are the behavioral intentions influenced by the atmospheric cues perceived during the experience of visiting the restaurant? Are there differences in sensory perceptions between developed and emerging markets? This study aims to shed light on these questions. Roth (1995) analyzed the moderating effect of national culture and regional socioeconomic variables in the relationship of sensory and functional brand image strategies with product performance of two product categories. In his study, he recognized that certain products may require customization, as changes in cultural and socioeconomic contexts could entail adjustments of the brand. This relates to the need to reach and maintain cross-national consistency of the brand across markets. Additionally, Park and Rabolt (2009) studied cultural value, consumption value and its influence on brand image. In their study, they suggest that future research considers cultural characteristics when ascertaining the differences of brand image elements, investigating it from the perspective of cross-cultural consumer behavior. Additionally, their recommendations are to include the level of economic development as a national characteristic when identifying the differences of brand perceptions across the world.  As Grewal, Levy and Kumar (2009) affirm, the analysis of macro factors has not received enough attention in the consumer research literature. The analyses in this paper take into consideration national differences on the relationship between atmospheric elements, sensory cues, perceived product and service quality and the perception of value and behavior of the consumers of global brands, to understand to what extent different markets perceive the sensorial cues of the retail environment and how consumer perceptions and behaviors differ across markets. Additionally, in line with Roth (1995), there is need for more studies that focus on changes in the environment, consumer perceptions and the effect of the customization of strategic marketing and brand elements (Roth, 1995).  In this study, it will be studied the differences in perception of between developed and emerging market consumers. By performing a multi-group analysis, the differences in culture and economic development are taken into consideration to analyzing the effect of atmospheric cues, products and service quality and its relationship with the perception of value, as an antecedent of behavioral intentions in developed and developing countries. Consequently, as an extension of previous research and existing models of retail atmospherics (Donovan and Rossiter, 1982, Spence, Puccinelli, Grewal & Roggeveen, 2014;Rogeveen, Grewal and Schweiger, 2019), we propose a model of multisensory restaurant atmospherics influencing the behavior of international restaurant consumers.  The contribution of this paper is twofold: it aims to analyze the role of atmospherics in international restaurant franchising, considering the effect of the context on the relationship servicescape elements and quality of products and services, as an antecedent of value perceptions and behavioral intentions of consumers in global markets.  Additionally, it sheds light into the standardization-adaptation dichotomy that international retailers, specifically in the restaurant industry, face when entering global markets and expanding internationally. In line with Chabowski, Hult and Mena (2011), this study answers their call for more research emphasizing consumer topics and franchising, specifically, studies that analyze variable such as perceived value and retail atmospherics. This paper studies the relationship of servicescape elements and quality with the standardization strategy in international franchise chains.  By juxtaposing consumer-centered research issues with research in international franchising and marketing, this paper provides a clearer understanding of standardization-adaptation decisions by international franchise firms and the journey of the consumers of global food retailers.  This research questions have been answered using survey data of McDonald consumers from 15 countries: Austria, Italy, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Portugal, France, Spain, Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Thailand and Russia, analyzed with multigroup structural equation modelling.  Theoretical background The servicescape is the place where the services are delivered and it could be compared with the packaging of a tangible product: in the same way as the packaging of a product is important for the correct communication of the brand’s attributes, the place and mode in which the services are delivered constitute the service scape.  (Solomon, 1985) The way in which a product is designed to convey a specific meaning and generate emotions, consistent with the brand image, the place of service delivery or servicescape should also be designed to convey a message through the sensory elements and environmental cues, signaling about the brand identity and attributes, while simultaneously enhancing the customer experience and adding value to the consumer journey. (Solomon, 1985; Blitner 1992; Baker, Parasuraman, Grewal & Glenn, 2002). In industries where the delivery of services is one of the core aspects, the design and presentation of the servicescape is highly important. Music and auditory cues Music has a significant impact in the emotions and behaviors of consumers. As shown by Mattila and Wirtz (2011), different types of music can stimulate different kinds of emotions and behaviors. When music is paired with scent, it leads to arousal conditions and enhanced pleasure, and it increases the positive perception of the environment, as well as the buying impulse and satisfaction. When pleasant cues are provided to the consumer, it can enhance the positive purchase experience (Milliman, 1982; Mattila and Wirtz, 2011). Garling and Owen (2006) also found that consumers stayed longer at a retail place when the music was familiar, had a lower volume and a slow tempo. Moreover, Caldwell and Hibbert (2002) in their study of music influence on behavior patterns of restaurant consumers, found that music preferences influence the time spent in the restaurant, which consequently influences the expenditure on food by the consumers.  Lighting  Ryu and Han (2011) studied how the customer perceptions of the physical aspects influence satisfaction and loyalty for those who were first time and repeating consumers in restaurants. They demonstrated that lighting, together with layout and service, had a significant effect on disconfirmation, satisfaction and loyalty. Lighting is one of the servicescape elements used by retailers to achieve optimal levels of sensory stimulation that can contribute to a positive consumer cognition, affect and behavior, in relation to the type of atmosphere that the retail establishment is trying to achieve (Spence et al., 2014). In the context of restaurants, lighting plays an important role to define the type of atmosphere and sensorial experience created for the consumers, constituting an important visual element of the brand identity (Rogeveen et al., 2019). Internal and external layout The customer experience starts before the costumer enters the store, therefore retailers need to acknowledge that it is part of a longer journey that occurs inside and outside the retail environment (Rogeveen, et al., 2019), the layout is one of the servicescape elements that has an important functionality element as its design provides the consumer with directions and facilitates the completion of sales (Bitner, 1992). According to Baker et al. (2002), the design cues of the retail store is the component of the atmospheric retail element that has the strongest influence on patronage intentions. The interior design of a store can determine how long a consumer will stay in the restaurant. Wakefield and Blodgett (1996) found that the aesthetic appeal of the site, layout accessibility, the décor and the architectural design had a significant effect on the perceived servicescape quality, satisfaction, and with the desire to stay. Product and service quality  The quality of goods and services is a key determinant of the perception of value in the shopping experience (baker et al., 2002). In firms that operate within the hospitality industry, the performance of employees in contact with the consumer is an essential driver to determine the consumer service quality perception (Jang and Namkung, 2009). The quality of goods and services an important characteristic for the consumers, as it determines to a great extent the perception of value and satisfaction for the consumer. When the image of the company is positive, the perception of quality of their products and services increases (Konuk, 2018). Previous research has found that food quality, which involves freshness, a good presentation, a good taste and menu item variety, influences consumer satisfaction(Kivela, Inbakaran & Reece, 1999). Ambience  Initially, ambience was one of the factors included as one of the three servicescape dimensions by Bitner (1992), in addition to spatial layout and functionality.  In the context of this study, ambience constitutes other non-visual environmental elements, such as olfactory cues, background noise, smell of the restaurant, air quality and temperature.  Biswas and Szocs (2019) found that when customers are exposed to the smell of indulgent food ambient scents such as baked cookies, it causes less purchases of unhealthy food, in contrast to the absence of scent or the smell of a non-indulgent food. International franchise chains like Subway, Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and Cinnabon use olfactory marketing and use food ambient scents to attract customers. Scent marketing has also been used by retail firms, hotels and resorts to engage customers through the sense of smell (Glazer, 2017).  Perception of value In 1988, Valarie Zeithal defined value as the consumer’s general evaluation of the usefulness of a product according to the perceptions of what is received on exchange of something given. Value is characterized to be a more complex construct. It is different to quality in that the value is a personal construct, therefore considered as a higher-level abstraction than quality. It also encompasses a dynamic of giving and receiving with involves resources such as monetary payment, time, energy and effort (Zeithaml, 1988). Although value definitions and specifications are generally related with quality, other components such as intrinsic (Olson & Jacoby, 1972) (concrete elements related with the physical constitution of the product) and sensory attributes, can be included by the consumer as a signal of quality that provides them with value (Zeitham, 1988). Multisensory restaurant atmospherics The effects of store atmospherics are emotional states that are difficult to articulate and remember, which also influence the behavior of consumers, affecting their intention to patronize the store (Donovan and Rossiter, 1982). The theoretical framework in this study is initially organized based on a Stimulus-Organism-Response model: it was originally proposed by environmental psychologists Mehrabian and Russel in 1974. It suggests that the environmental stimuli (s) generate emotional and cognitive processes (O) that generate a specific behavior or response (Chang, Eckman and Yan, 2011).  In 1982, Robert Donovan and John Rossiter were the first researchers to apply the model to a retail environment. A suitable S-O-R model is composed by a stimulus taxonomy or environment, a group of conceptually clear and measurable intervening variables and a response, which in the case of Donovan and Rossiter (1982) are approach or avoidance behaviors towards a retail store, measured by the willingness to pay, the desire to explore or not to explore the store, to exit the store, to communicate or interact with others and the plans to repeat the shopping experience.  Since then, the Mehrabian-Russel model has been widely applied in marketing research to analyze the elements of retail environments, in terms of the specific characteristics that generate stimuli to the consumers (Spangenberg and Crowley, 1996).  It is a theory that explains how the environmental exposure influence the consumer purchase decision (Slama and Tashchian, 1987).  and drawing from the multisensory framework by Spence et al (2014), a model of global multisensory restaurant atmospherics is proposed.  In the case of this study, instead of a set of the emotional mediating states such as pleasure, arousal and dominance used by Donovan and Rossiter (1982), the mediating variable is the perception of value of the consumers of an international food retailer. Furthermore, in this study the resulting or response variables of approach or avoidance are measured in terms of the behavioral intentions of the consumers, specifically whether or not they intent to comeback, choose, speak positively and recommend the restaurant to others in the future.

The survey was designed using 7-point Likert scale and applied to consumers when exiting the restaurant, with the objective that the respondent would have a clear memory of the perceptions that were part of the consumer experience in the restaurant. It was performed in 2 specific places in each chosen city:  in a McDonalds restaurant located in the city center and another located in a shopping mall. The data was collected in 2015. The questionnaire was designed using 7-point likert scale. It includes the following constructs: environment perceptions (like music, lightning, ambience, internal and external layout), actual and ideal self-concept of consumers, with respect to a “stereotypical” McDonald’s consumer, product quality perceptions, service perceptions, quality perceptions, consumer satisfaction and behavioral intentions. For the purpose of this study it was used partial least squares. It was chosen as the method of analysis because it allows the analysis of complex hypothesized models as it contains many constructs and relationships between variables, in addition to the exploratory aspects of the study (Hair et al., 2018). The respondents that are part of the analysis are from 15 different countries: Argentina, Austria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Portugal Russia, Spin, Thailand and the United Kingdom for a total of 8,290 respondents, who approximately 50.52% identified themselves as male and 49.48% as female.

The effect of product quality is strong, with a coefficient of 0.621 (p-value less than 0,001), confirming hypothesis H6. Additionally, service quality was found to be significant, positively affecting value perception (β=0,339; p-value<0,001) supporting H7. Light has a direct positive effect on value perception (β=0.032, p-value=0.016), confirming H3. External and internal layout were also significant, with a beta equal to 0,131 and 0,108, and p-values lower than 0,001 respectively, confirming H4 and H5.   Music was found to be the only non-significant variable in its relationship with the perception of value and behavioral intentions in the model, failing to confirm hypothesis H1. Additionally, we can affirm that perceived value has a strong positive relationship with behavioral intentions (β=0.621, p-value<0.001), therefore we fail to reject H8 and inferring support to our model. The R for perceived value is 0.557 and for behavioral intentions is 0.38 which shows the high explanatory power of the model.  Table 5. Specific Indirect effectsRelationship Coeff. Sample Mean  S.D.

Music perceptions is the only significant variable with a negative significant indirect effect on behavioral intentions.  Meaning that based in our model, the type and volume of music played in the fast-food chain does not influence the willingness of the consumers to recommend the restaurant, to comeback or choose it again in the future and to say positive things of the restaurant.  After obtaining the bootstrapping results of the main structural equation model estimation, it was decided to make a comparison of the different countries via a multiple group structural equation analysis. This technique was also performed via bootstrapping with 5000 different subsamples. The main objective of this technique is to study whether or not the perceptions of value and behavioral intentions are different among countries. Another reason was to analyze the extent to which the inherent cultural and socioeconomic differences among emerging and developing markets affect the perceptions of service scape, quality, and its relationship with perceived value and intentions in both groups (table 6). In order to do that, a grouping variable was created. The 15 countries where divided in developing and developed countries, based on the United Nations country classification (2014). Among the developing countries are Argentina, China, Egypt, India, Israel, Russia and Thailand. The countries classified as developed, in the second group are: Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italia, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Table 6.

Discussion After performing the multigroup analysis comparing countries, we found that the only significant differences in perceptions between developed and developing countries are in the effects of service quality and lighting on value perceptions and intentions. When taking a closer look at the effect of service quality on value perceptions and consumer intentions, we can see that the quality of services in developing countries has a higher influence on value perceptions and patronage intentions of McDonalds consumers from developing countries than for consumers from developed economies.   This could mean that higher the level of development of the country, lower the influence of the service quality in the perception of value. Maybe, it could be due to the fact that more restaurants use self-service in developed countries compared to restaurants in emerging markets where labour costs are lower. This could imply that McDonalds needs to be attentive to the provided service quality and its influence on value perceptions in developing economies. Furthermore, McDonalds and international fast-food retailers need to analyze their procedures, operations and routines, as consumers in emerging markets give greater importance to the quality of services in fast food restaurants than the consumers in developed countries.  The other significant difference between emerging and developed countries is in the influence of lighting on the perception of value and intentions. Developing countries presented a negative, non-significant relationship between servicescape lighting, perceptions of value and behavioral intentions. In constrast, developed countries show a positive, significant relationship between lighting and value perception, posively affecting consumer patronage intentions. The fact that lighting does not affect significantly the value perception of McDonalds consumers in emerging markets, but it does affect value perceptions and behavior in developed markets confirms that there are social and cultural differences among consumers across countries and that those differences should be taken into consideration by managers when expanding internationally. This finding means that consumers in developed economies give greater importance to ambience and servicescape lighting in restaurants than their developing markets counterparts. Therefore, managers should pay greater attention to this servicescape element in developed economies as it could signify a greater value perception from their consumers in these markets, and ultimately, better patronage intentions.   Through these findings we can infer that service standardization, which has been one of the main characteristics of McDonalds and other international fast food franchise chains, should be reconsidered when entering developed and emerging economies, as not all elements are perceived equally across markets. Additionally, they could asses whether or not service quality procedures could be improved first in developing countries where service quality has a higher influence in consumer intentions, and then test or replicate the new standards in developed markets as incremental or significant system-wide quality improvements could signify a greater perception of value globally, and ultimately, better behavioral intentions and greater satisfaction and loyalty from consumers. Conclusions  We can see that the hypothesis were supported in the model, therefore it is possible to conclude that servicescape elements such as music and lightning, together with the quality of products and services offered by the company, have a positive influence in the perceived value of global firms. Moreover, the lightning, ambience, external and internal layout, and quality of products and services of the firm have an indirect effect in behavioral intentions trough the international consumers perception of value. Furthermore, the results indicate that servicescape lighting has a higher influence in the value perception and behavioral intentions of consumers from developed countries versus their emerging market counterparts where this relationship was non-significant. Additionally, the quality of services has a higher influence on the perception of value and behavior of consumers from developing countries, in comparison with the consumer from developed countries where the effect of service quality on value perceptions and patronage intentions is not as strong. This means that international franchise restaurants need to reconsider the standardization of these two elements, when expanding in global markets, as there are cultural and socioeconomic differences that can influence the perception of value and patronage intentions of their consumers.  Finally, the perceived value of international consumers positively affects the behavioral intentions towards the brand, influencing whether or not they will patronize it in the future.

Corporate Social Responsibility in franchise chains: Specificities, insights from French franchise chains’ CSD and avenues for future research Abstract Franchise chains – as most companies outside the franchise sector as well – are becoming increasingly committed to environmental, social and societal transitions. Despite this growing trend over the last decade, only a few researchers have focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the specific case of franchising. The aim of our paper is to explore how franchisors report on their sustainable practices, and emphasize subsequent directions for future research. In order to do so, we focused on Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) of franchisors operating in the French market in which regulations on non-financial information disclosure exist for large companies. It is based on a multiple case study approach, with the examination of CSD by eight franchise chains operating in hotels, fast food/bakeries, clothing and automotive repair industries in the French market. Our findings show that these franchisors disclose rich and diversified information on their CSR activities. Our research contributes to the literature on CSR in franchise chains and the practice. Keywords Franchising, Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development, Corporate Social Disclosure, Environmental, Social and Governance information.1. Introduction “‘I made the decision to remove plastic wherever possible, and we have invested a lot to innovate with answers that are relevant for our customers and for the environment’, explains McDonald’s France CEO, Nawfal Trabelsi. […] This approach is therefore part of McDonald’s France’s progressive positioning in terms of environmental transition, which began more than ten years ago. After changing its logo from red to green in 2010, the fast-food giant in France has made a series of eco-responsible commitments: organic milk in its milkshakes, delivery fleets fueled by used frying oil from its French restaurants, packaging designed to minimize waste, a waste sorting system for restaurants, and even an ‘energy plan’ implemented throughout the production chain, highlighted in particular by the installation of heat pumps.” (Le Parisien [French newspaper], 10 February 2021This is an example – among many others across various industries – of franchisors committed to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions. Indeed, franchise chains – as most companies outside the franchise sector as well (Chuah et al., 2020; Iglesias et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) – are becoming increasingly committed to environmental, social and societal transitions (Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018). A few years ago, Perrigot et al. (2015) showed that more than 85% of their 136 sampled French franchisors communicated about at least one of their CSR activities on their websites.  Despite this growing trend in the franchise sector over the last decade, research on CSR in the specific case of franchising remains limited (e.g., Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018). Scholars have, first, highlighted several determinants                                                             https://www.leparisien.fr/environnement/environnement-fini-les-jouets-en-plastique-chez-mcdonald-s-10-02-2021-8424323.php of franchise chains’ CSR actions, either chain characteristics (e.g., Choi & Lee, 2018; Kaufmann et al., 2008) or management-related characteristics (e.g., Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Sebastiani et al., 2014). Second, several studies focused on franchise chains’ Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) and franchisors’ motivations to communicate about their CSR activities (e.g., Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018). Third, various consequences of CSR practices on franchise chains were identified at the brand image level (e.g., Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017) as well as the managerial level (e.g., Lee et al., 2012; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012).  We believe that CSR, in the specific case of franchising, deserves particular attention and further investigation. The interest of studying CSR in the franchising context is twofold; not only franchising is relevant to the wider dissemination of CSR practices, but also CSR practices are relevant for franchise chains. On the one hand, franchising – through the duplication of a business-format in tens, hundreds or thousands of locations – is a way to maximize the impacts of CSR practices at the local, regional, national and even international levels. On the other hand, CSR can be beneficial to franchisors on several levels, including brand image. All franchisorsseek a strong brand image for their chains, in order to attract customers, franchisee candidates, employees for the units, etc. (Nijmeijer et al., 2014; Nyadzayo et al., 2011; Roh & Yoon, 2009). CSR practices and, above all the disclosure on CSR practices, provide a means for franchisors to reinforce their chain brand image (Cha & Jo, 2019; Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017; Perrigot et al., 2015). This positive impact on brand image can hence improve chain performance (Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017; Kim & Lee, 2020; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012).  Moreover, franchisors engaging in CSR actions can enhance their relationships with employees (Lee et al., 2012), and above all, with franchisees, in particular regarding franchisee trust and satisfaction, and prospective franchisees (Lee et al., 2016). According to these authors, such “activities will help franchisors not only retain current franchisees but also attract prospective franchisees by enhancing corporate image and solidifying the relationship with the franchisees” (Lee et al., 2016, p. 57).  Nevertheless, engaging in CSR activities is particularly challenging in the franchising context and thus requires specific attention as argued by Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012). Indeed, franchisees are independent entrepreneurs (Dant & Gundlach, 1999; El Akremi et al., 2011); hence, franchisors cannot impose CSR activities on their franchisees. For instance, if franchisees are not interested in CSR initiatives, franchisors cannot force them to invest in new waste sorting systems, or materials that are more eco-friendly, or specific local sponsorship. Franchisor explanations – conveyed through headquarters staff and on-field consultants – are mandatory for convincing franchisees to engage in CSR. These explanations entail the rationale behind such actions, the practices to be implemented and the potential impact on franchisees’ businesses in terms of image, customer relationship management, competitive advantage, performance, etc.  Moreover, when franchisees are committed to CSR activities, franchisors must pay close attention to the consistency of their implementation. For CSR actions to be impactful, franchisors and franchisees must both be consistent, franchisors at the global level (international, national or regional) and franchisees at the local level. For instance, if franchisors are committed to the inclusion of disabled people in their workforce, they will implement specific processes to accommodate disabled employees at the chain headquarters, do a partnership with an international or national charity organization dedicated to disabilities. They will also have to ensure that this action plan is being relayed at the local level. For instance, franchisees will be encouraged to employ disabled people in their units, and sponsor local associations dedicated to children, teens or adults with disabilities. Another example involves franchisors committed to environmental preservation, through working with an international or national NGO. Their franchisees will have to pursue the same strategy, by using recyclable products in their units and participating in local actions such as city or river cleaning days. Franchisor and franchisee CSR actions must be aligned, both emphasizing a set of consistent commitments.  Finally, franchisors must involve not only their franchisees but also all their stakeholders in their commitment towards CSR. Franchisors cannot succeed on their own in implementing CSR throughout their chains; they require the involvement of their main stakeholders, which of course include their franchisees (as mentioned above) as well as their suppliers, store employees, customers, etc. (Perrigot et al., 2021). Regarding suppliers, we can mention the fast food industry in which franchise chains’ suppliers will contribute to environmental preservation through an improved waste management system (e.g., supply of recyclable packaging), the grocery industry in which suppliers will promote local products, and the clothing industry in which suppliers will pay attention to working conditions inside the factories. Employees in direct contact with customers are especially decisive since they are the ones who will or will not apply the right practices in terms of waste management in the units. In addition, they (among other stakeholders) will encourage customers to participate in these minimization and sorting efforts, they will also include disabled people in their team. These specificities and challenges being exposed, the aim of our paper is to explore how franchisors report on their sustainable practices, and emphasize subsequent directions for future research. In order to do so, we focused on CSD, following most studies that used it as a proxy for activity in the area of social and environmental responsibility. Such studies are based on the assumption that the level of CSD is correlated with the company’s socially responsible behavior (Cowen et al., 1987; Perrigot et al., 2015; Roberts, 1992; Ullmann, 1985). Nowadays and in the French context, this hypothesis is reinforced by the adoption of several regulations dealing with non-financial information disclosure and audit (see section 3.1.). The term CSD is used to indicate corporate reporting focusing on environmental and social issues. CSD is not limited to financial information but involves such areas as climate change abatement, human rights, employee relations, product liability, philanthropy, and corporate governance. Firms usually disclose such kind of information in their annual reports, press releases, websites, or in separate social reports (Montecchia et al., 2016). While several authors used this CSD-based approach towards CSR (e.g., Perrigot et al., 2015; Utgård, 2018), they did not focus on the content of franchisor messaging. Instead, they considered the presence or not and the number of occurrences of the information regarding specific CSR activities on franchisors’ websites. In this research, we go further by interpreting, from an in-depth qualitative viewpoint, the content of the information disclosed by franchisors. Since franchisors can signal their quality through CSD (Utgård, 2018), we expect the content of the information disclosed to provide a thorough understanding of their reporting strategies. This approach allows us to rely on data disclosed by franchisors and therefore accessible to their stakeholders rather than on declarative data. Moreover, we do not limit our observations to franchisor websites and include the content of the non-financial information of their annual reports when they publish any, as well as information released in the press.  Our empirical study deals with the French market in which regulations on non-financial information disclosure exist for large companies. It is based on a multiple case study approach, with the examination of CSD by eight franchise chains operating in hotels, fast food/bakeries, clothing and automotive repair industries in the French market.  Our findings show that franchisors disclose information covering a wide range of CSR activities related to environmental, social and societal challenges. To do so, they have developed highly structured approaches based, for example, on committees dedicated to CSR. Our research also emphasizes that franchisors can rely on various stakeholders to achieve their sustainable goals (e.g., franchisees, employees, customers). Moreover, in line with regulation theory (Perrigot et al., 2015; Posner, 1974), we notice that franchise chain actions can be influenced by a fear of future coercive measures, albeit some of their activities demonstrate a strong commitment to CSR and a willingness to exert a positive corporate impact (Depoers & Jérôme, 2017; 2019). In addition, we observe that chain characteristics (i.e., chain size and chain resources) and management-related characteristics (i.e., CSR experience) impact the extent of CSR, which is consistent with prior research (e.g., Choi & Lee, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015). Our research contributes to the literature on CSR in franchise chains and, more specifically, the stream dedicated to franchisors’ CSD (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Kaufmann et al., 2008; Perrigot et al., 2015; Perrigot et al., 2021; Utgård, 2018). More specifically, our paper provides new insights into franchise chain CSD, based on a multi-industry content analysis rather than mere content reporting. Our research also has managerial implications. Our findings may help franchisors enrich their CSR communication on their websites, and also engage in various CSR actions. They may additionally help them to target and select franchisee candidates who share their values, in order to maximize the efficiency of their CSR approach. To finish, our findings can serve to encourage franchisors to develop organizational know-how related to CSR and codify part of it as business know-how.  Our paper is organized as follows. In the second section, we review the literature on CSR in franchising. We present the methodology in the third section. We describe and discuss the findings of our multiple case study in sections 4 and 5, successively. 2. Literature review  2.1. Dimensions of franchise chains’ CSR practices As evidenced by Perrigot et al. (2015), franchise chains can engage in a wide range of CSR and sustainable actions (e.g., economic, social, environmental). Studying franchisors’ CSD practices thus requires finding or adapting a precise analysis grid that is as exhaustive and objective as possible, which can prove to be a complex task. Within the scope of franchising studies, several classifications developed by scholars and consulting firms have been used. Carroll's (1991) prominent pyramid of CSR, composed of economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities, has been favored by various authors (e.g., Cha & Jo, 2019; Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Lee et al., 2012). However, as pointed out by Kim and Thapa (2018), this classification neglects the environmental dimension, which also merits consideration. Kaufmann et al. (2008) used a four-dimensional grid – i.e., philanthropy, sponsorship, cause marketing, and volunteerism – that focuses on the nature of CSR actions rather than their outcome. Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012) based their study on the six dimensions of the KLD Research & Analytics, Inc. grid, slightly adapted to franchising specificities – support for the community, franchisee/employee relations, environment, human rights, products and services, corporate governance. As for Perrigot et al. (2015), they adapted a grid from Ernst and Ernst (1978) to assess the disclosure of franchisors operating in the French market; they distinguished seven categories of practices – environment, human resources, products, fair business practices, community involvement, ethics, and other practices. These categorizations are not enough accurate and researchers need to identify dimensions as indicated by “Grenelle II” Law (42 items described by the French regulator) and to investigate disclosure quality (Baalouch et al., 2019; Chauvey et al., 2015).2.2. Franchise chains’ CSR motivations In line with stakeholder-agency theory (Hill & Jones, 1992), franchisors will invest in CSR and disclose information regarding their sustainable activities only if it can be profitable for them (Perrigot et al., 2015). Similarly, scholars have referred to resource-based theory (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018) as well as signaling theory (Utgård, 2018) to support this opinion. More extensively, many academics examine, still now, the link between CSR and financial performance (Zhao & Murrell, 2021) in order to better manage CSR practices and understand corporate motivations. Consequently, CSR motivations and disclosure practices can vary significantly from one franchisor to the other depending on stakeholders’ expectations and their willingness to satisfy these expectations (Baird et al., 2012).  In fact, Sebastiani et al. (2014) classified franchisors into three groups based on their corporate sustainability strategy and the relationships they seek to develop with their franchisees. Traditionalist franchisors pay limited attention to sustainable issues and engage in a few sustainable actions with their franchisees. Relationship-focused franchisors mainly favor social practices aimed at enhancing sustainable relationships with their franchisees. True Bluesfranchisors engage in a wide range of social and environmental sustainable practices and seek to develop sustainable relationships with both internal (including franchisees) and external stakeholders. They found that more than two-thirds of their sampled franchisors and franchisors’ staff were into the first group, i.e., traditionalist franchisors. Franchisors can also invest in CSR practices in order to enhance their brand image vis-à-vis the final customers, who will be more loyal and more willing to spend money in their stores, the potential franchisees who will be more willing to join the chain as franchisees, as well as potential employees who will apply for available positions in the stores and at the headquarters (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015). For this brand purpose, franchisors disclose CSR information on their websites (Perrigot et al., 2015) and press releases (Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012), and in specific reports for some franchisors operating large chains. 3. Methodology 3.1. Context Our empirical study deals with franchising in France. France counts 2,049 franchisors and 78,218 franchised units generating an estimated 757,852 jobs and 67.80 billion euros of total sales (French Franchise Federation, 2021). Franchisors in the French market are especially committed to CSR. Indeed, an empirical study showed that 86.03% of 136 sampled franchisors were disclosing information on at least one CSR-related action (Perrigot et al., 2015), which is much higher than results from similar studies conducted in other markets, for example, 29% in the American market (Kaufmann et al., 2008) and 22.9% in the Mexican market (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018).  Moreover, in Europe, under NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive – Directive 2014/95/EU), since 2014, all large companies have to publish reports on the policies they implement in relation to ESG concerns: environmental preservation, social responsibility and treatment of employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, diversity on company boards (in terms of age, gender, educational and professional background). The directive offers flexibility for companies to disclose information in the way that they consider most useful. Nonetheless, they are obliged to give a description of their policies and results, the risks related to these matters and how they intend to address them. Subsequently, companies may use international, European guidelines or national laws. In France in particular, these requirements are not recent. Many regulations require companies both disclose non-financial information (social report Law, 1977 and New economic regulation Law, 2001), and audit this information (225 Art. Grenelle II, 2010). Consequently, large companies in France have a high level of maturity regarding CSD. Specifically with the environmental data, disclosures become more technical and precise (Albertini, 2014). Academics showed that the level of non-financial disclosure is positively related with the intensity of regulation (Barbu et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2020; Senn & Giordano-Spring, 2020). 3.2. Multiple case study approach We adopted a multiple case study approach to study franchisors’ CSD practices. This method has been used in the franchising literature (e.g., Bradach, 1997; Doherty & Alexander, 2006) and is particularly relevant for topics which have received scarce academic attention (Perry, 1998). To gain an extensive understanding of franchisors reporting practices, we focused on four different industries in which franchising is particularly well developed on one side, and CSR important on the other side: hotels, fast food/bakeries, clothing and automotive repair. For each of these industries, in an attempt to get diversified illustrative cases, we selected two distinct companies, one group operating several franchise chains subject to a reporting obligation and which therefore publish an annual report containing non-financial information, and another chain which is not affected by any reporting requirement.  Regarding the hotel industry, our illustrative cases are the Accor group and B&B Hôtels. The Accor group was founded by Paul Dubrule and Gérard Pélisson in 1967 when they opened the first Novotel hotel in Lille-Lesquin. The Accor group now includes 5,100 hotels under 39 brands in 110 countries worldwide, it generates 3.610 billion euros of total sales. Their most famous franchise chains in the French market are Ibis (created in 1973, franchised in 1974, 387 hotels in France), Ibis Budget (created in 1991, franchised in 1992, 351 hotels in France), Ibis                                                             https://group.accor.com/fr-FR/group/who-we-are/accor-in-brief Styles (created and franchised the same year, in 2007, 221 hotels in France), Mercure (created in 1973, franchised in 1975, 249 hotels in France) and Novotel (created and franchised the same year, in 1967, 114 hotels in France). As far as B&B Hôtels chain is concerned, it was founded in 1990, and started franchising in 1996. There are 493 B&B Hôtels in twelve countries, mainly in Europe, among which 70 franchised hotels and 230 company-owned hotels in FranceRegarding the fast food/bakery industry, our illustrative cases are the Le Duff group and La Mie Câline. The Le Duff group was launched in 1976 when Louis Le Duff opened the first Brioche Dorée in Brest. In addition to some activities in the agribusiness industry (e.g., Bridor), the group now operates five chains in the fast food/bakery and restaurant industries. Their largest fast food/bakery chain in the French market is Brioche Dorée, which was created in 1976 and started franchising in 1992. This is a plural form chain composed of 166 franchised units and 119 company-owned units in France. They also have 132 units abroad. Their other chains are Del Arte (208 Italian restaurants in France), Fournil de Pierre (16 units in FranceLa Madeleine (96 units in the United States) and Kamps (412 units in Germany). Concerning La Mie Câline, the first unit opened in 1985, and they started franchising the concept one year later, in 1986. The chain is now composed of 225 franchised units and 14 company-owned ones. They operate in the French market onlyRegarding the clothing industry, our illustrative cases are the Beaumanoir Group and Ekyog. The Beaumanoir Group was founded in 1981, when Roland Beaumanoir opened his first unit                                                             https://group.accor.com/fr-FR/group/who-we-are/accor-worldwide  http://www.franchise-hotelbb.com/  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/b-b-hotels  https://www.groupeleduff.com/home/historique  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/brioche-doree  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/Del-arte  https://www.groupeleduff.com/enseignes/fournil-pierre  https://www.groupeleduff.com/enseignes/madeleine  https://www.groupeleduff.com/enseignes/kamps  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/la-mie-caline in Saint-Brieuc. The group now operates various franchise chains in France and has a presence abroad, with 2,614 units in Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa. Their most popular franchise chains in the French market are Bonobo (created in 2002, franchised in 2006, 84 franchised units and 87 company-owned units) and Cache-Cache (created in 1985, franchised in 1991, 110 franchised units and 104 company-owned units). In 2016, they launched Vib’s, a multi-brand concept combining Bonobo, Bréal and Cache-Cache within a same unit. There are 182 units operated in France through franchising and company ownership. As far as Ekyog is concerned, it was launched in 2003, they started franchising in 2006. They now have 18 unitsRegarding the automotive repair industry, our illustrative cases are the Mobivia Group and Feu Vert. The Mobivia Group was founded by Eric Derville in 1970. They operate various businesses in link with automobile services, among which two famous franchise chains in the repair segment: Midas and Norauto. Midas started in 1952 in the United States and in 1976 in France, where the first franchised unit opened in 1979. Mobivia acquired the Midas brand in 2004. They now have 327 franchised units and 30 company-owned units in the French territory. Regarding Norauto, they started their businesses in 1970, and started their franchise operations in 1981. Their chain is composed of 130 franchised units and 276 company-owned units. As far as Feu Vert is concerned, the first unit was opened in 1972, and the first franchised unit in 1979. They have 182 franchised and 172 company-owned units in France                                                            https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/historique/  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/linternational/  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/bonobo  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/cache-cache https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/marque/vibs/  https://www.ekyog.com/fr/content/14-liste-des-boutiques-ekyog  https://www.mobivia.com/convictions/histoire/  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/midas  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/norauto-franchise  https://www.franchise-fff.com/enseignes/feu-vert 3.3. Data collection The growing tendency towards non-financial reporting has led to the generation of many documents (Montecchia et al., 2016). We collected data from multiple and complementary sources which provide a holistic view of franchisors’ CSD: the websites of the chains, the websites of the groups when chains belonged to a group, the non-financial information of their annual report if they publish any, and the recent press articles on these chains when information was related to CSR practices.  In order to be as exhaustive, reliable and precise as possible, we relied on an analysis grid stemming from the French government. Indeed, the Article 225 of the “Grenelle II” Law establishes the rules for producing reports and the information to be included in these reports. Companies over a certain size (i.e., more than 500 employees and 40 million euros in sales or 20 million euros in total assets for publicly-listed companies, and more than 500 employees and 100 million euros in sales or total assets for non-listed companies) have to issue non-financial reports and “comply or explain” why they cannot disclose an information. Article 225 lists 42 items split into three main categories in favor of sustainable development: environmental information, social information and societal information (see Table 1). All data collected were classified in this analysis grid by two of the researchers to limit interpretation bias.  << Table 1 to insert here >> 4. Findings Franchise chains are increasingly well structured to address CSR-specific challenges. Some franchisors developed committees dedicated to this particular purpose. For instance, the Mobivia Group, operating the Midas and Norauto brands, appointed a “Sustainable                                                             https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0095 Development Committee […] to ensure that the actions and projects of companies in the Mobivia ecosystem are in line with an ambitious Sustainable Development strategy leading to the creation of shared economic value and a positive social, environmental and societal contribution”. This statement highlights the multidisciplinary nature of franchise chains’ CSD, which can focus on either environmental, social or societal aspects. We found information related to all 42 items of our grid, which confirms this diversity of franchisors’ CSR practices.  4.1. Environmental information Our sampled franchisors appeared to be particularly concerned by their environmental impact. In fact, we found information on all 14 environmental items of the grid, thus highlighting the wide range of activities in which they are involved. Some franchisors, like Midas and Norauto through the Mobivia Group, sought to promote their commitment and continuous improvement by obtaining high environmental value certification such as ISO 14001, that assess environmental management through cross internal audits on every Norauto centers of the group. This emphasizes that franchisors tend to exceed legal requirements in terms of environmental commitment.  Moreover, we observed that the success of franchise chains’ environmental practices relies on various stakeholders, which is consistent with previous research on CSD (e.g., Perrigot et al., 2015; Perrigot et al., 2021). First of all, franchisors can educate their employees in order to reduce resource consumption and contribute to the chain’s sustainable strategy. To this end, the Beaumanoir Group has developed a training program specifically for purchasing teamsFranchisors can also involve their customers by sensitizing and informing them about                                                             https://www.mobivia.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/DPEF-2019-2020.pdf  https://www.mobivia.com/assets/uploads/2021/01/DPEF-2019-2020.pdf  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf sustainable practices. For instance, the Beaumanoir Group’s brands “are making their customers aware of the role they can play to better preserve water when they wash their products”. They provide their customers with “recommendations for taking care of products while preserving the planet [that] are included on [their] care labels”. Moreover, the mitigation of externalities generated by customers seems to be important for franchisors, as illustrated by B&B Hôtels’ implementation of “chargers for electric cars” to allow customers to “recharge their vehicles for free”. Such a measure encourages the use of electric vehicles and, consequently, limits the environmental impacts resulting from fossil fuel consumption. In addition, franchisors can base their environmental activities on innovative partnerships which may first be tested in company-owned units, and once they have proven to be successful, implemented in franchised units. We can mention, in particular, the Le Duff Group, which “launched a pilot test of the Too Good To Go mobile application in Brioche Dorée units in France to combat food waste by selling baskets filled with the day's unsold items at reduced prices”. In light of its success, this solution was then extended to all company-owned units and probably to numerous franchisees attracted by the Too Good To Go concept. As a matter of fact, franchisees are considered the cornerstone of the chain’s sustainable actions, as pointed out by the Accor Group, which “has made commitments to combat food waste, the consumption of non-renewable resources and the reduction of its contribution to water stress, the achievement of which depends largely on its partners, particularly hotel owners”Finally, franchise chains can engage in collective actions with other companies, sometimes even competitors, sharing common interests in the area of CSR. This can be illustrated by the                                                             https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://www.hotel-bb.com/fr/entreprise-durable-rse  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2019/08/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2019/08/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf Beaumanoir Group, which decided to sign the Fashion Pact along with more than 60 other companies in the fashion industry, thus committing “to curbing global warming, restoring biodiversity and protecting the oceans, and to implementing concrete actions in their respective organizations”. Some of these visible actions can in fact be explained by regulation theory since franchisors’ motivations may stem from a willingness to promote their chain’s commitment and therefore avoid future coercive regulations (Leung & Snell, 2017; 2021; Perrigot et al., 2015; Perrigot et al., 2021). << Table 2 to insert here >> 4.2. Social information The second category of CSR-related information disclosed by franchisors refers to social practices. Again, the franchisors in our sample report on a variety of activities that cover all 18 items in our grid. First, franchisors can emphasize the positive outcomes stemming from the duplication of their concepts in territories where their units are located. The Accor Group, for example, placed a strong emphasis on diversity, which is why “women represent 43% of the workforce and 34% of hotel managers, in company-owned, under management contract and franchised hotels” of its brands. It should be further noted that the Accor Group overwhelmingly relies on partnerships (i.e., franchising and management contracts) rather than company ownership to expand its chains, given that partners employ about 94% of the group’s total workforce (280,000 employees)                                                            https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf Second, franchisors can promote the evolution and career advancement of employees working in their chains. For example, 20% of La Mie Câline’s franchisees “come from the network”Internal mobility can also be promoted through employee training, which is why all Le Duff “group’s companies have set up structured integration and training programs” and “the Group's head office is recognized as a Training Organization […], enabling it to deliver qualifying training programs”. This training policy is even more relevant given that franchisors have a contractual obligation to transfer their know-how and therefore train their franchisees. Third, franchisors can improve the working and living conditions of both their employees and franchisees’ employees in several ways. With this in mind, the Accor Group has “defined a global compensation policy for employees at its headquarters and in its company-owned and under management contract hotels”, which “is adapted to the specific practices of each country”. Moreover, these adaptations to local culture and customs are essential to employee well-being. International franchisors are then particularly vigilant in this regard. As an example, Kamps (the Le Duff Group’s chain located in Germany) allows remote working and flexible hours for its employees as well as “special days dedicated to health, paid for by the company's mutual insurance company”. Another major challenge for franchisors is the safety of employees working within their chain. This concern is of paramount importance since franchisors must ensure that the safety of employees working in their units, regardless of the organizational form (i.e., franchised, under a management contract, company-owned), is not compromised. For this purpose, the Accor Group has set up an alert line “accessible 24/7 in 29                                                             https://www.lamiecaline.com/fr/enseigne-restauration-rapide/environnement  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf languages and […] scheduled to be opened to employees of other under management contract and franchised hotels”Fourth, franchisors can contribute to an improved social climate by implementing equal treatment policies within their chains. Such policies might focus specifically on recruiting and including people with disabilities. Feu Vert insisted on maintaining “a 3.5% hiring rate of disabled personnel, above the national average in the private sector” owing to “a proactive policy to promote the integration of disabled persons by giving them a full place within the company”, while accompanying each new employee with a disability through a dedicated mentorship. Nevertheless, not all franchisors are as successful as Feu Vert in including workers with disabilities. Indeed, the Accor Group disclosed employing 2,094 individuals with a recognized disability in its company-owned and under management contract hotels, which accounts for only 1% of its total workforce. The Beaumanoir Group participates twice a year in the Hello Handicap virtual recruitment fair, which each time allows recruiting several people. Although this approach has positive implications, it merely offers temporary work contracts that do not provide long-term employment for disabled personnel. In addition, these equal treatment policies can be oriented towards other populations, such as ethnic minorities. This is notably the case for Accor, where “each country in which the Group operates is implementing an action plan based on local discrimination issues. In Australia, for example, specific programs have been implemented to promote the inclusion of Aboriginals”<< Table 3 to insert here >>                                                             https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://www.feuvert-entreprises.fr/a-propos/developpement-durable-et-responsable/  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf 4.3. Societal information The franchisors selected for the purpose of our study disclosed information regarding various societal-oriented actions implemented within their chain. Indeed, whether it concerned territorial impact, philanthropy, relationships with suppliers or human rights, their determination to address societal challenges seemed to be particularly strong, as evidenced by the fact that we found information covering all the items of our grid (i.e., 9 out of 9). Through their geographic expansion, franchise chains can exert a positive impact on the dynamism and economic activity of the territories where they choose to locate units. As an example regarding Del Arte (belonging to the Le Duff Group), “for each franchisee or company-owned restaurant opening (between 10 and 25 openings per year), an average of 20 jobs are created locally, for which the company favors permanent contracts”. The Le Duff Group further explained that “local recruitment is done in conjunction with local partners: Pôle Emploi [employment office], schools and training centers, hotel schools, etc.”. In addition, franchise chains can create indirect jobs by collaborating with local producers or suppliers. This is the case for Bridor (the Le Duff Group’s brand supplying Brioche Dorée units), which purchases all of its flour from local millers operating close to its production site. In fact, agency theory has demonstrated that franchisees usually have a better knowledge of their local territory and are more committed than company-owned unit managers to expanding their business (Combs & Ketchen, 2003). Franchisors therefore have an incentive to recruit franchisee candidates who share common values, in order to maximize positive impacts and strengthen the effectiveness of their CSR actions.                                                              https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf Franchise chains’ social-oriented actions can also play out at a broader level, i.e., nationally or internationally, though philanthropy for instance. This is indeed the case for Feu Vert, which initiated a partnership with the NGO “Children of the Mekong”, in donating some of its profits to finance the education of young children in South AsiaFurthermore, franchisors seem to be particularly cautious regarding the societal impacts associated with their purchasing policies. As Ekyog pointed out, they “pay great importance to the origin of the materials used to make [their] sustainable clothing” and “know precisely the conditions of culture and harvest (organic agriculture, reasoned...)”. For its part, the Beaumanoir Group requires suppliers to sign their “Ethics Charter and therefore to commit to respecting [their] code of conduct and the social and environmental standards contained therein”. This prudence however can sometimes extend beyond selecting virtuous suppliers, as some franchisors also support suppliers’ efforts towards improving their social practices. In this regard, the Le Duff Group works with its suppliers “to build channels where animal welfare is a top priority”Moreover, franchise chains are attentive to their customers’ safety, not only in terms of health (e.g., Ekyog guaranteed “the absence of the use of any toxic or harmful substance”) but also with regard to the protection of their personal data. As such, the Accor Group implemented new measures in 2019 to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These include a “review of the clauses governing the use of personal data in franchise and management contracts” as well as the creation “of a toolkit for hotels to develop and deploy their compliance programs”. This last point is of interest since it implies franchisor know-how                                                             https://www.feuvert-entreprises.fr/a-propos/developpement-durable-et-responsable/  ekyog.com/la-marque/tracabilite.html  https://www.groupe-beaumanoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DPEF-2019-20_VF-allégée.pdf  https://www.groupeleduff.com/app/uploads/2020/09/DPEF_2019_LEDUFF_FR.pdf  https://www.ekyog.com/la-marque/nos-engagements.html  https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf which can be codified and transferred to franchisees. This know-how transmission can also be illustrated by the Accor Group’s commitment to provide “all hotels with awareness-raising kits including web series, e-learning and video learning” in order to protect human rights. In fact, franchising facilitates a virtuous scaling mechanism that magnifies the impacts of CSR actions at both the franchisor and franchisee levels. << Table 4 to insert here >> 5. Discussion 5.1. Contributions to the theory Our research builds on the literature on CSR in franchise chains, and more specifically from the CSD viewpoint. Findings show that our eight sampled franchisors disclose extensive information on their CSR activities. According to the typology built by Sebastiani et al. (2014), most of our franchisors can thus be considered as True Blues engaged in numerous social and environmental sustainable practices and seeking to develop relationships with both internal and external stakeholders.  Moreover, we observed that the groups operating several franchise chains, i.e., Accor, Beaumanoir, Le Duff and Mobivia, tend to disclose more CSR-related information than the other chains. These findings are consistent with Resource Theory (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), according to which franchisors’ resources will condition their commitment to CSR (Choi & Lee, 2018; Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012).  It also appears that larger chains, by virtue of belonging to a group, are more active with respect to CSR. This is in line with previous research that pointed the positive and significant impacts                                                             https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf of a chain’s size on its CSR commitment (Flores Villanueva & Gaytán Ramírez, 2018; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015). Furthermore, these groups were founded a long time ago, more than 40 years ago, thus contradicting the findings of Flores Villanueva and Gaytán Ramírez (2018), who observed that older franchisors were engaged in fewer CSR activities than younger ones.  In addition, we observed that chains for which CSR lies at the core of their business, e.g., Ekyog, disclose a considerable amount of CSR-related information, thereby confirming that aside from chain characteristics, other management-related characteristics may be major determinants of chains’ CSR activities (Sebastiani et al., 2014). Indeed, franchisors with substantial experience in CSR issues will tend to increase their chains’ CSR actions, as argued by Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012).  Lastly, bearing in mind the positive impact of CSR on brand image and performance (e.g., Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Jeon & Gleiberman, 2017; Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012), it should be noted that franchisors’ CSD practices may be less sincere than they appear and constitute a form of “greenwashing” or strategy to avoid new coercive regulations (Leung & Snell, 2017; 2021). Nevertheless, part of these limitations can be addressed by the fact that some franchisors’ CSD are output-oriented and hence refer to tangible and measurable CSR actions. 5.2. Contributions to the practice Our research contributes to the practice. First, by showing that all franchisors within our sample are actively pursuing CSR initiatives, our findings can encourage other franchisors to set up and implement CSR activities in their own chains and then communicate regarding these activities. CSR is no longer an option; it has become critical for franchise chains to reinforce their brand image, differentiate their brands and build long-term relationships with their stakeholders, i.e., franchisees, employees of franchisees, customers, suppliers, etc.  Then, our findings can help franchisors enrich the CSR-related content on their websites while strengthening their CSR commitment to other CSR-related activities. Our illustrations of the 42 grid items, within four different industries, serve as suggestions to franchisors at the beginning of the CSR engagement process.  Finally, our findings suggest that franchisors seek to involve all their stakeholders in their CSR activities, in particular their franchisees at the local level. For instance, the Accor Group “has decided to set up a hotline dedicated to Ethics, Compliance, Health and Safety, Human Rights and the Environment […] scheduled to be opened to employees of other under management contract and franchised hotels in 2020”. To get the support of franchisees in implementing CSR activities at the local level, franchisors must “think CSR” from the very beginning of the franchise relationship, that is from the time of franchisee candidate selection. Franchisors select new franchisees according to several criteria, including financial resources, previous experience and knowledge of local markets (e.g., Clarkin & Swavely, 2006; Jambulingam & Nevin, 1999). In addition to these factual indicators, shared values must be taken into consideration (El Akremi et al., 2012). If franchisee candidates are found to have an interest in environmental preservation, diversity and inclusion, it will then be easier to collaborate on CSR projects over the whole period covered by the franchise contract.  Moreover, CSR practices can be integrated into franchisor know-how, both organizational and business know-how. Franchisors can develop organizational know-how, i.e., capabilities and competencies (Perrigot et al., 2020) over time, through different ways: recruitment of CSR experts at the chain headquarters, conduction of benchmarks on best practices, cooperation with stakeholders. This organizational know-how will indirectly benefit the franchisees, and directly benefit them if franchisors are able to transfer a part of it as business know-how (Perrigot et al.,                                                             https://group.accor.com/-/media/Corporate/Investors/Documents-de-reference/DEU_ACCOR_2019.pdf 2017). Franchisors could in fact insert into the operations manual a number of processes that for instance deal with waste management and use of local products in the restaurant industry, customer incentives to return empty perfume bottles in the cosmetics sector, or responses to the specific needs of disabled employees. This codification of CSR know-how would serve to facilitate implementation in the units. 5.3. Limits and tracks for future research Our research has some limitations and open avenues for future research. Firstly, we focused on CSD only, i.e., franchisor communication regarding their CSR actions but not the actions themselves as they are implemented in practice at the chain headquarters as well as in the franchised units and company-owned units (if any). Although this approach provides an accurate overview of the CSR information accessible to franchisors' stakeholders, further research could explore CSD or CSR practices through in-depth interviews conducted with franchisors, franchisees, franchisee candidates, employees and consumers. In particular, more research is needed on the implementation of CSR activities across the three dimensions: environment (e.g., green practices), social (e.g., diversity) and societal (e.g., relationships with suppliers). Such research is currently underway, green practices and waste management in the fast food sector (Perrigot et al., 2021), and the inclusion of disabled employees in the hospitality and service industries (Le Bot & Perrigot, 2021). Future research should be extended to other industries, such as clothing, cosmetics and homecare services, where franchising is also widespread.  Secondly, our empirical research is based on a multiple case study approach, hence findings cannot be generalized. Examining the website content of all chains within a same industry might prove to be a relevant approach. Thirdly, even though we used a grid to analyze the content of franchisor websites and reports, interpretation issues could be raised. Lastly, we focused on France where there are many regulations on CSR and CSD (NER Law, “Grenelle II” Law, PACTE Law – 2019 - allowing companies to define a “raison d’être” and to change status in a “benefit corporation”), comparing franchisor CSD across several countries could allow taking the regulatory impact into consideration (Jackson et al., 2020). To conclude, our findings show that franchisors report rich and diversified information on their sustainable practices, in response to regulation and Society pressures. More research is needed in CSR reporting, as well as CSR practices, in the specific case of franchising. Work Health and Safety in Franchise Networks: A Regulatory Hot Potato? Dr Tess Hardy Associate Professor Melbourne Law School University of Melbourne Melbourne, Victoria, 3003 Australia Telephone: +613 8344 2590 Email : tess.hardy@unimelb.edu.au Presented at the 34th Annual International Society of Franchising Conference USC Business School May 24-26, 2021 Work Health and Safety in Franchise Networks: A Regulatory Hot Potato? Abstract Prior to the arrival of the COVID-19 in early 2020, the challenges of promoting compliance with work health and safety () obligations in franchise networks had been largely overlooked in mainstream media and public commentary. The pandemic has refocused attention on the health and safety risks faced by frontline workers in casual or insecure work arrangements, including within franchise networks. Ensuring WHS obligations are met is essential not just for preventing the spread of disease amongst workers, but for protecting the community at large. This paper considers the regulation of WHS in the context of franchise networks in Australia. The paper begins with a summary of studies which have attempted to identify and assess the health and safety risks posed by franchise networks, including economic pressures faced by franchisees, fractured lines of responsibility and the characteristics of workers engaged in much franchise work. The paper then considers the harmonized work health and safety legislation in Australia and the way in which this unique statutory scheme maps onto franchise networks. Next, the paper surveys some of the key cases in this area to assess how courts approach the difficult task of ascribing liability for health and safety contraventions occurring in franchise networks. In concluding, the paper identifies possible lines for future research regarding the effective regulation of WHS in franchise networks. Key words: Health and safety; employment; work; COVID-19 INTRODUCTION Since systemic underpayment was revealed at 7-Eleven, tackling wage theft in franchise networks has dominated many inquiries and driven much law reform. In comparison, the difficulties of promoting compliance with work health and safety () obligations in franchise networks have been largely neglected in the public debate. However, this has started to shift since the arrival of COVID-19. The pandemic has refocused attention on the health and safety risks faced by frontline workers in flexible or fissured work arrangements because this has ‘made disease prevention and suppression more difficult.’Indeed, early in the pandemic, 14 McDonald’s outlets in Melbourne were forced to close, and 1000 employees were stood down, as a result of workplace transmission risks. Similar concerns were raised by McDonald’s workers across the globe.Issues such as inadequate staff training, the insufficient supply or use of personal protective equipment and fears associated with reporting injuries and illnesses when employment is precarious have all been brought to the fore. It has become clear that ensuring WHS obligations are met within the workplace is essential not just for preventing the spread of disease amongst workers, but for protecting the community at large. It is also evident that  Allyson O’Connor, Trevor Peckham and Noah Seixas, ‘Considering Work Arrangement as an “Exposure” in Occupational Health Research and Practice’ (2020) 8 Public Health 363.

In late March 2020, all 1400 McDonald’s restaurants across the UK and Ireland were closed on the basis of safety concerns of employees and customers. Over the course of the past 12 months, many McDonald’s workers in the US have threatened to go on strike due to safety concerns. Fowler (n 3).  the health and safety of workers may be compromised in fragmented employment arrangements, such as franchise networks, due to economic pressures, blurred lines of responsibility and key characteristics of franchisees and franchise workers.  This paper considers the nature of health and safety risks in franchise networks in Australia and the regulatory response to these risks. The paper begins with a summary of studies which have attempted to analyse the health and safety risks posed by franchise networks, especially in key sectors, such as food retail. The paper then considers the harmonized work health and safety legislation in Australia and the way in which this unique statutory scheme maps onto franchise networks. Next, the paper surveys some of the key cases in this area to assess how courts approach the difficult task of ascribing liability for health and safety contraventions occurring in franchise networks. In conclusion, the paper underlines the need for improved data collection and further research about effective regulation of health and safety issues. HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES IN FRANCHISE NETWORKS: A SUMMARY Employment laws across many developed economies have traditionally been premised on two key assumptions. The first is that employees are generally vulnerable and in need of statutory protection beyond that afforded under the common law. Conversely, non-employees, including contractors, bailees and franchisees, are assumed to be less in need of elevated protections and the general law applicable to commercial arrangements is seen as appropriate. Second, employment laws are founded on the assumption of a unitary  Paul Harpur and Philip James, ‘The Shift in Regulatory Focus from Employment to Work Relationships: Critiquing Reforms to Australian and UK Occupational Safety and Health Laws’ (2014) 36 Comparative employer –  that is, ‘the same firm controls the site, manages the workers, bears the risks, and makes the profit.’ However, since the mid-1970s, both these assumptions have started to come undone in light of the global move away from stable, secure, full-time work towards temporary, insecure and casualised arrangements. Well before the current pandemic, it was evident that work arrangements have been ‘increasingly deviating from this standard conception of employment in contemporary labor markets.’Over the course of the past four decades, a range of studies have shown that non-standard work arrangements, a lack of job security and income inequality have had deleterious effects on occupational and public health. Non-standard work has been associated with higher injury frequency rates, greater injury severity, more hazard exposures and poor mental health. These arrangements have also been found to threaten the capacity of workers to obtain essential information, receive critical training, be fitted with appropriate PPE, control their working time and/or participate in WHS more generally.  Quinlan has argued that these adverse outcomes may be due, in part, to the fact that competitive pressures induce firms to not just adopt fragmented business models, but to Labour Law and Policy Journal 111, 111. See generally Richard Johnstone and Richard Mitchell, ‘Regulating Work’ in Christine Parker, Colin Scott, Nicola Lacey and John Braithwaite (eds) Regulating  (2004) 101.  Leslie Boden, Emily Spieler and Gregory Wagner, ‘The Changing Structure of Work: Implications for Workplace Health and Safety in the US’ (Paper prepared for the Future of Work Symposium, US Department of Labor, 9-11 December 2015).

Reviewing Research and Policy Debates on the OHS Effects of Outsourcing and Home-Based Work’ (2008)International Journal of Health Services 489. take risks when it comes to WHS. This may lead to underbidding on contracts, a failure to properly maintain equipment, a decrease in staff levels, limited training or a reduction in supervision and monitoring. Boden, Spieler and Wagner have observed that the factors ‘that produce lower wages and wage and hour violations may also result in cutting corners on providing a safe and healthy workplace.’ In support of this contention, they point to an earlier study undertaken by Filer and Golbe, which found that serious violations of OSHA standards were inversely related to firms’ operating margin.These issues are further exacerbated by blurred lines of responsibility which can lead to chaotic or disorganized work processes. As O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas point out, shared or confused responsibility ‘over who is required…to provide training and personal protective equipment or report work-related incidents leaves workers vulnerable.’ Where fissuring has led to the shedding of employment by larger firms to smaller, subsidiary firms – whether via franchising or otherwise – these smaller employers are often less capable of managing WHS risks effectively. These problems are further magnified in sectors where workers are vulnerable in one or several respects – for example, temporary migrant workers moving from job to job may have less control over working time, less agency to pursue a complaint and less capacity to access a union. Finally, Quinlan points out that precarious workers are afforded weaker protection under occupational health and safety legislation,  Michael Quinlan, ‘The Effects of Non-standard Forms of Employment on Worker Health and Safety’ (Discussion Paper No. 67, International Labour Organisation, 2015) 3-13.  RK Filer and DL Golbe, ‘Debt, Operating Margin, and Investment in Workplace Safety’ (2003) 51 The Journal of Industrial Economics 359.  O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas (n 1) 4. See also J Howard, ‘Non-Standard Work Arrangements and Worker Health and Safety’ (2016) 60 American Journal of Industrial Medicine  Boden, Spieler and Wagner (n 6) 24. as well as workers’ compensation laws. In addition, O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas have pointed out that workers in non-standard arrangements may lack access to benefits, such as paid sick leave, which may lead those workers to work while sick or injured. As the pandemic has shown, sickness presenteeism has a range of negative health consequences, including increased risk of injury to the worker, and potentially exposing co-workers, customers and the general public to infection. In short, the existing research suggests that fissured work arrangements have a multitude of ‘implications for worker health and safety by potentially intensifying existing hazards or creating new ones within the workplace’and WHS regulation ‘has been slow to adjust to these changing work patterns.’So far, however, there have been very few published studies which have specifically or separately analysed the impact of franchising on WHS. A notable exception is the study conducted by the Young Workers’ Centre in 2018, which surveyed around 370 young workers about their experiences of health and safety within franchises. This survey revealed that 65% of young franchise workers feel bullied, unsafe or uncomfortable at work. This is partly due to the fact that many young employees are required to work alone in franchises during unsociable hours (such as early in the morning late at night) without adequate support or supervision to keep them safe. Survey respondents reported that perceptions of vulnerability were elevated in particular situations, such as when they were handling cash or where they were serving customers who may be affected by drugs or  Quinlan 2015 (n 11).  O’Connor, Peckham and Seixas (n 1), 3.  Richard Johnstone, ‘Regulating Work Health and Safety in Multilateral Business Arrangements’ (2019) Australian Journal of Labour Law 41, 42.   Boden, Spieler and Wagner (n 6) 14. alcohol. In addition, 40% of young franchise workers reported that they or a co-worker had suffered a physical injury at work. The most common involved burns (41%), cuts (29%) and falls, slips or trips (15%). This survey also found that while franchisor representatives frequently visited their workplace, these representatives were far mor focused on store presentation (89%) than whether staff had completed relevant training (40%).  The findings of the Australian survey echo other studies undertaken in the United States. For example, the National Employment Law Project found that in a period of three years ending in April 2019, the media had reported on more than 700 incidents of workplace violence at McDonald’s stores across the US, including shootings, robberies, sexual assaults and other forms of harassment and abuse. This analysis – which considered violent incidents reported in the media, violence data from two cities, and interviews with current and former McDonald’s workers – found that McDonald’s long hours of operation routinely expose workers to risk due to high levels of violence associated with late night retail (between 10pm and 4am). The report argued that by failing to provide sufficient training to staff or adopting violence hazard controls, such as cash handling procedures and panic buttons, McDonald’s was not complying with its ‘legal and moral duty to provide employees a safe work environment.’ An earlier national study of health and safety conditions in the restaurant industry in the US found that more than 95% of workers had either been cut or burned on the job; almost 25% came into contact with toxic chemicals at  National Employment Law Project, Behind the Arches – How McDonald’s Fails to Protect Workers from Workplace Violence (May 2019).  their place of work; over 87% did not get paid sick leave; and 64% cooked and served food while sick.REGULATION OF WORK HEALTH AND SAFETY IN AUSTRALIA From the 1970s onwards, comprehensive WHS statutes were enacted at Commonwealth, state and territory levels, seeking to prevent and address the occurrence of work-related injury and disease. Although the legislation in all these jurisdictions ‘were broadly consistent in approach, there were many differences in matters of detail’. One of the common features was a desire to extend protections which were ordinarily confined to common law employees to other types of workers who lay outside the employment paradigm. For example, section 21 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (Vic) required the employer to provide information, supervision and training to non-employees, such as independent contractors and their employees. In addition, sections 22-23 imposed duties on employers and self-employed persons to persons who were not employees, such as customers and passers-by. This broad duty to ‘others’ was designed to extend protections to a range of different business models, including franchisees and their employees and contractors.The Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, Serving While Sick: High Risks and Low Benefits for the Nation’s Restaurant Workforce, and Their Impact on the Consumer (September 2010) < https://chapters.rocunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/reports_serving-while-sick_full.pdf>.  As at 2011, prior to the wide-scale harmonisation of WHS legislation in Australia, the principal Occupational Health and Safety Acts in force were: Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 (Cth); Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW); Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Qld); Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Act 1986 (SA); Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 (Tas); Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic); Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (WA); Work Safety Act 2008 (ACT); and Workplace Health and Safety Act 2007 (NT).  Andrew Stewart et al, Creighton and Stewart’s Labour Law (Federation Press, 6 ed, 2016) 541.   See Richard Johnstone, ‘Paradigm Crossed? The Statutory Occupational Health and Safety Obligations of the Business Undertaking’ (1999) 12 Australian Journal of Labour Law 73. From 2008, there was a desire, and concerted effort, to ‘harmonise’ the disparate legislative frameworks with the aim of having a single, uniform law applicable across all nine jurisdictions. These efforts culminated in the publication of a Model Work Health and Safety Bill in 2010. By 2012, all jurisdictions, except Victoria and Western Australia, had enacted WHS Acts adopting the terms of the Model WHS Bill.In stark comparison to the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act), the harmonised work health and safety legislation ‘no longer normalises the employment relationship as a starting point of regulation’. Instead, under the WHS Acts, ‘primary’ responsibility is placed on ‘a person conducting a business or undertaking’ to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of ‘workers’ and ‘other persons’. The definition of a ‘person conducting a business or undertaking’ – colloquially referred to as a PCBU – includes not just employers, but also principal contractors, head contractors, occupiers and franchisors, amongst others. Unlike the secondary liability provisions of the FW Act or the US concept of ‘joint employment’, there is no requirement to show that the PCBU has ‘control’ over the work. Harpur and James observe that the WHS Acts are deliberately geared towards a more expansive form of business regulation ‘that serves to limit the extent to which the  See, eg, Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth), Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (NSW); Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Qld), Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (ACT); Work Health and Safety (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011 (NT); Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (SA); and Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (Tas).

WHS Acts, s 19(1)-(2).  WHS Acts, s 5 of WHS Acts See also Explanatory Memorandum, Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 (Cth), [23].   Johnstone 2019 (n 17) 48. application of health and safety duties are decisively shaped by the corporate veil, corporate structures and physical location.’Similarly, the term ‘worker’ under the harmonized WHS Acts is exceptionally wide. In particular, this term is defined under the WHS legislation as including any person who carries out ‘work in any capacity for’ a PCBU, including work as: a contractor; a sub-contractor; an employee of a labour hire company; an outworker; and as a volunteer.Further, as Johnstone points out, this definition only requires the worker to work for PCBU – in other words, it expressly contemplates the fact that here may be more than one PCBU and there is no requirement for the worker to work for the PCBU who owes the s 19(1) duty.The broad scope of these provisions and the potential way in which they might apply to a franchise arrangement was described by Johnstone et al as follows: As the franchise arrangement is part of the franchisor’s business, a franchisor will owe the primary duty in s 19(1) to the franchisee, to the franchisee’s employee, and to all “workers” (for example, contractors and subcontractors) engaged by the franchisee. And even if such parties are not found to be “workers” “engaged”, “influenced” or “directed” by the franchisor, they will be “other persons” who might be “put at risk from work carried out as part of the conduct of the business or undertaking”. Harpur and James (n 5) 123.  WHS Acts, s 7.   Johnstone 2019 (n 17) 46.  Johnstone et al (n 25) 167. Importantly, the WHS Acts contain provisions which are designed to address what is sometimes referred to as ‘counterproductive liability avoidance’ – that is, where firms seek to recalibrate their contracting relationships to avoid being defined as an employer or further reduce the extent to which they monitor a franchisee’s practices. Rather, the WHS legislation is crafted in a way that seeks to encourage firms to respond with the ‘right kind of liability avoidance’, that is, by taking additional, voluntary measures to minimise the relevant legal risks, including closer monitoring of contractors, increased investment in training and skills or reintegrating the work back into the core organisation. To achieve this objective, the legislation provides that: a) the relevant duties cannot be delegated; b) one person can owe a number of duties; and c) more than one person can hold a duty, and each person must comply with the duty even though it might be also owed by others.Together, these provisions mean that both the franchisor and the franchisee owe primary duties concurrently to the franchisee’s workers and contractors, and to members of the public. A related aspect of the WHS Acts is the way in which they impose a horizontal duty on all PCBUs to consult, cooperate and coordinate with other PCBUs. Again, this provision is specifically designed to address the ‘problem of hazards arising from fractured, complex and disorganised work processes.’ This horizontal duty requires, for example,  Cynthia Estlund, ‘Who Mops the Floor at the Fortune 500?

In addition, there is a ‘vertical’ duty for a PCBU to consult with workers (or their health and safety representative) who carry out work for the business or undertaking and who are, or are likely to be, directly affected by a WHS matter. To satisfy this obligation, franchisors and franchisees must, so far as is reasonably practicable, consult all the workers working for the franchisee.Finally, the WHS Acts place a ‘positive and proactive duty’ on each officer of each PCBU ‘to exercise due diligence’ to ensure that the PCBU complies with all relevant duties and obligations arising under the Act. An officer can be prosecuted for a failure to exercise proper due diligence, even if the PCBU itself is not breaching its own duties.In summary, the WHS Acts are explicitly designed to ‘protect all workers in all kinds of work arrangements arising from new and changing business models, and from all kinds of existing and emerging hazards.’ In doing so, the Acts arm the state-based WHS inspectorates with a ‘rare regulatory tool to prompt a systematic approach from the top of the structure’. This is very much in line with idealized models of enforcement, such as  Johnstone et al (n 25) 167.   WHS Acts, s 47.  Ibid.  Section 27(5) of each of the WHS Acts defines ‘due diligence’ to include taking ‘reasonable steps’ to do the following, amongst other things: to acquire and keep up-to-date knowledge of work health and safety matters; to gain an understanding of the nature of the PCBU’s operations and generally of the hazards and risks associated with these operations; and to ensure that the PCBU has, and implements, processes for complying with any duty or obligation under the Act.   See s 27(4) of WHS Acts.  Johnstone 2019 (n 17).  Ibid 58.  David Weil’s approach of ‘strategic enforcement.’ However, as Johnstone laments, there has been very little evidence of WHS regulators taking a proactive, creative or strategic approach to regulating WHS risks in franchise networks, and other multilateral business arrangements.INSIGHTS FROM CASE LAW CONCERNED WITH WHS ISSUES The novelty of the harmonised WHS provisions, together with the fact that they are still relatively new, means that it is not entirely clear how these provisions will play out, and how liability will be ascribed in the context of franchise networks. Although key provisions have changed under the WHS Acts, some of the prosecutions brought under predecessor legislation are still instructive in in showing how regulators are likely to frame the prosecution’s case, and how courts may potentially respond.  While the number of cases which deal with WHS offences within franchise systems are limited in number, the bulk of decisions involving franchises tend to focus exclusively on the failures of the employer at law, which is typically the franchisee. For example, in Safework NSW v QSR Pty Ltd a young worker engaged at a KFC site run by a multi-unit franchisee was injured after stepping in hot oil. While the franchisee was convicted and fined $60,000 for a breach of s 19(1), the franchisor was not named as a defendant. Further,  David Weil, Improving Workplace Conditions through Strategic Enforcement: A Report to the Wage and Hour Division (Report, Boston University, May 2010).  Johnstone 2019 (n 17) 58.   In extensive searches across all relevant legal databases and WHS websites, 21 cases were identified as involving work health and safety related contraventions in franchise networks. This is unlikely to be comprehensive or exhaustive and it is quite possible that other cases have been decided in this context. However, it is very difficult to trace the case law in this area due to a lack of published decisions.  [2019] NSWDC 67. to the extent that the court referred to the role of the franchisor, it was in positive terms. A similar approach was adopted in Boland v Balhahn Pty Ltd t/as Balhannah Mitre 10 In this case, which was brought after two employees of a Mitre 10 franchisee were injured while at work, the court was squarely concerned with the failures of the franchisee (which had no safe system of work for moving stock with forklifts). The court made no comment or observation regarding the duties or role of the franchisor in this respect. Franchisors have generally only been held liable for WHS contraventions occurring at company-owned units – that is, where they own and operate the relevant site. This was the case in both DPP v Hungry Jacks, Visy & Veolia and Boland v Kentucky Fried Chicken Pty LtdThere are, however, two  notable cases which depart from this general trend where the court has found that the franchisor has breached their statutory duty as a person who has ‘control’ of a place of work (which was a narrower provision relevant under the predecessor legislation before the harmonised WHS Acts came into effect). In Inspector Estreich v Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd the franchisor of a mobile hose repair business –  [2017] SAET 112.  A similar approach was adopted in a string of WHS cases brought against the franchisee as direct employer: see Campbell v H&T Cook Enterprises and Cook [2020] SAET 241; Osborne Park Commercial Pty Ltd v Miloradovic [2019] WASCA 17; Wyatt v MR & RC Smith Pty Ltd [2010] WADC 178; Terra Firma (Newcastle) Pty Limited t/as “Amber Tiles Newcastle Limited” v Margaret Smith and Philmar Investments (Newcastle) Pty Ltd [2009] NSWWCCPD 145; Glen Rowe v Q-COMP [2009] QIRComm 9; Barnett v Domino’s Pizza Australia New Zealand Limited [2007] SAIRC 2; Erindale M Pty Ltd v Curran [2004] ACTSC 69; Inspector Barbosa v McDonald’s Australia Limited [2003] NSWIRComm 196; and Inspector Louise May v McDonald’s Australia Limited [2002] NSWIRComm 179.  [2018] VCC 1454. In this case, a person was killed, and another injured, when they were struck by a large recycling bin that was being emptied at a Hungry Jacks store. This store was owned and operated by the franchisor and they were ultimately prosecuted and fined for breach of s 23(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Cth) as the direct employer.  [2017] SAIRC 16. Here, the franchisor was fined for breaching s 19(1) of the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (SA) after an employee was injured (when they fell into a container of hot oil) at a site owned and operated by the franchisor (who was effectively the direct employer in this case).  See WorkCover Authority of NSW v McDonald’s Australia Limited & Anor [2000] NSWIRComm 277.   [2011] NSWIRComm 11. Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd – was fined $110,000 for breaching s 10(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW). In this case, an employee of the franchisee – Maintenance & Contracting Pty Ltd () – had been injured when one of the gas cylinders in the truck he was driving unexpectedly exploded. The truck had been supplied by Parker Hannifin to the franchisee as part of its franchise arrangement. The truck’s ventilation system did not comply with the relevant Australian Standards for vehicles carrying flammable gases. In addition, the franchise agreement required MCP to comply with all Parker Hannifin’s operating procedures, including an OH&S procedure. However, there was no express operating procedure relating to ventilation requirements for vehicles. In assessing the serious of the offence, Haylen J observed that the franchisor had fundamentally misunderstood its OHS obligations to its franchisees which was not a view reached by taking advice on the subject but was basically an assumption made because of the fact that the Hose Doctor franchises were independent businesses who had been sub-contracted to perform service functions using the defendant's product. It is difficult to accept that these matters should reduce the seriousness of the offence. The defendant was a well-developed corporation with, admittedly, a comprehensive safety system mainly in relation to its own employees and in relation to the use to be made of its products but it had neglected to make safety arrangements concerning the operation of the Hose Doctor franchises who were a significant part of the manner in which the defendant undertook its business. Even a superficial review of the many occupational health and safety prosecutions dealt with in this part of the Court's jurisdiction would have quickly shown that the Court had consistently and frequently drawn attention to the fact that occupational health and safety obligations could not be delegated and especially could not be delegated to sub-contractors, even though those arrangements might have widened the field of persons to whom the defendant had obligations in relation to the safety of the people involved. This legislation has now been repealed. Inspector Estreich v Parker Hannifin (Australia) Pty Ltd [2011] NSWIRComm 11 [21]. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v McDonald’s Australia Limited and Another,the franchisor was fined a total of $270,000 for breaching ss 17(1)(a) and (b) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW). In this case, an employee working at a franchisee-owned outlet was killed after being electrocuted while cleaning a grill at the restaurant. McDonald’s Australia Limited was prosecuted in its capacity as lessor of the premises where the incident occurred (under s 17(1)(a)) and as the franchisor (under s 17(1)(b)). Under the relevant franchise agreement, the franchisee was required to comply with every component of the McDonald’s system, including uniform specifications and facilities. The franchisor also specified the layout and design of the building, as well as fixtures and equipment of the restaurant. In assessing the appropriate penalty, Walton J pointed to the terms of the franchise agreement and the lease as the relevant sources of ‘control’ exerted by McDonald’s Australia over the franchisee. The judge went on to note that the control exercised by McDonald’s Australia was  was both direct and significant in determining the system of work (in relation to the cleaning and maintenance of grills) in the restaurant operated by Lyndhurst. Even though the employees were those of Lyndhurst and Lyndhurst retained at all relevant times obligations for the training of each person and the provision of a safe system of work, the system of work was substantially governed by the controls exercised by the first defendant [2000] NSWIRComm 277  Section 17(1)(a) of the NSW OSH Act provided that a person who has control of non-domestic premises which have been made available to persons (not being the person’s employees) as a place of work shall ensure that the premises are safe and without risks to health. Section 17(1)(b) provided that a person who has control of any plant in any non-domestic premises which have been provided for the use or operation of persons at work (not being the person’s employees) shall ensure that the plant is safe and without risks to health. WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v McDonald’s Australia Limited and Another [2000] NSWIRComm 277 [197]. One of the most recent, and potentially most significant, cases relating to WHS issues is one that was not brought under the WHS legislation. In this case, the Retail and Fast Food Workers’ Union (RAFFWU) brought a civil remedy proceeding under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) against Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd (Tantex) – a multi-unit McDonald’s franchisee. In finding in favour of RAFFWU, Logan J held that Tantex’s assertion – via Facebook – that WHS laws do not provide workers with a right to have a drink or go to the toilet outside their scheduled 10-minute drink break amounted to misrepresentation, coercion and adverse action under the FW Act. The franchisee was ultimately fined $82,000 for the relevant breaches. In handing down the penalty, Logan J noted that  Employers need to be sensitive to that when a worker asserts a workplace right and not find comfort in that imbalance by not giving weight to the possibility that the worker might be right. On the whole of the evidence, I was left with the distinct impression that this had occurred in relation to Ms Staines’ [the manager’s] assertion. Even if one were disposed not to react to the assertions of an individual worker, the Union’s emphatic adoption of that same position and advocacy for it ought to have occasioned this and at least a careful, studied reading of the clause, if not the taking of advice. Tantex had multiple potential sources of such advice, either in-house from its human resources staff, from the franchisor or, based on its apparent financial resources, from external legal or industrial relations advisers.Following the decision on the merits of the case, the franchisor – McDonald’s Australia Pty Ltd – stated that the company continues to ‘work closely with our restaurants to ensure Retail and Fast Food Workers Union Incorporated v Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd [2020] FCA 1258 (31 August 2020).  Retail and Fast Food Workers Union Incorporated v Tantex Holdings Pty Ltd (No 2) [2020] FCA 1644 (13 November 2020).   Ibid [46].  employees receive all the correct workplace entitlements and pay.’ The spokesperson for the franchisor also confirmed that the franchisee had implemented ‘processes to ensure ongoing compliance’ and that any other McDonald’s staff who might have queries should contact the ‘dedicated employee assistance hotline.’ The franchisor finished by saying that McDonald’s Australia remains ‘committed to working with our employees and franchisees to ensure any concerns are addressed.’However, the pandemic has raised a whole set of new WHS issues at McDonald’s, as well as other franchise networks. The fast food industry has been subject to a high level of scrutiny due to Victoria’s ‘McCluster’, where 12 COVID-19 cases were linked to one McDonald’s outlet in Fawkner. Subsequently, another 13 McDonald’s venues across Melbourne were shut down due to concerns about workplace transmission. Many of the regulatory challenges identified earlier in this paper – including a young workforce that was not properly trained or supervised – were cited as exacerbating WHS issues. The secretary of RAFFWU, Josh Cullinan, commented that:  At McDonald’s 80 per cent of their workforce is under 21. They’re not used to workplace safety precautions. When a manager says, go and work in the drive-through, it doesn’t occur to them to  wash their hands between every transaction, or they’re too nervous to mention it.However, the power of the franchisor to voluntarily shape WHS outcomes was demonstrated in July 2020 – when the second wave emerged in Victoria. Before the government mandated the wearing of masks, McDonald’s Australia announced that all  ‘McDonald’s operator threatened workers on Facebook: Court’, Workplace Express, 1 September 2020.  Fowler (n ?). employees across metropolitan Melbourne would be required to wear face masks ‘out of an abundance of caution.’CONCLUSION In light of the recent focus on WHS issues faced by frontline workers, such as those working in many fast food franchises, this paper has examined the evidence relating to WHS risks in franchise networks and the regulatory response to those risks. While there is substantial evidence to suggest that fissured work arrangements – such as subcontracting or labour hire – lead to adverse WHS outcomes, there are far fewer studies which have focused on the impact of franchising on health and safety. Further data on this issue would deepen our understanding of the regulatory challenges and opportunities presented by franchise networks when it comes to effective management of WHS issues. There remains much that we do not know in this regard. The harmonized WHS legislation represents a significant shift away from the dominant employment paradigm. The primary obligations of the WHS Acts are deliberately framed in an inclusive and expansive way and impose overlapping and concurrent duties on both franchisors and franchisees. Notwithstanding the ‘radical recasting’ of duties and obligations, the majority of decided cases tend to focus on breaches committed by the direct employer (i.e. the franchisee). The lack of cases, and the absence of direct intervention, has not necessarily prevented high profile franchisors, such as McDonald’s, from adopting a proactive approaching in managing WHS risks, particularly since the pandemic. Again,  Chanel Zagon, ‘McDonald’s staff required to wear face masks in Melbourne’, 9 News, 14 July 2020.  Johnstone 2019 (n 17). further research is required to assess whether, and to what extent, other franchise brands in other industry sectors are also taking voluntary steps to address WHS issues and what factors are driving these shifts in compliance behaviour.   Unstoppable scandals of Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. in South Korea Jean Jeon, PhD Associate Professor, Marketing College of Business University of Nevada, Reno / MS0028 Reno, Nevada 89557-0206 Office: 775.682.9166 Email: hjeon@unr.eduJohn Nolan, JD Lecturer, Management College of Business University of Nevada, Reno / MS0028 Reno, Nevada 89557-0206 Email: johnnolan@unr.eduInternational Society of Franchising 2021 Annual Conference Submitted March, 2021  Unstoppable scandals of Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. in South Korea Abstract Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. (hereafter “Namyang”) is one of the largest dairy manufacturers in South Korea (Dairy Market News Letter 2020). Namyang has franchised its dairy distribution system. In 2013, three former and current franchisees alleged that Namyang’ engaged in unreasonable coercion to purchase dairy products (i.e., “mireonaegi” in Korea) and coercion to provide benefits. Even though the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act in South Korea prohibits coercion of transactions and abuse of superior bargaining position, mireonaegi had been a well-established convention in franchising. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Korea found a legal advisory opinion that showed the illegality of excessive mireonaegi when investigating Namyang The Korea Fair Trade Commission also found evidence that supported franchisees’ allegations and imposed a penalty of 12.3 billion KRW (10.9 million USD). However, two years later the company filed a lawsuit for denying the illegality of unreasonable coercion to purchase dairy products to its franchisees. Since 2013, consumers continued to boycott Namyang’s products. The company has never recovered its sales in the dairy industry in South Korea. Recently, the company proposed a resolution to the commission to improve its relationships and business practices with franchisees.  Learning Outcomes Students will:  understand the nature of monopoly regulation and fair trade practices evaluate business practices explain both legal and social consequences of companies’ wrongdoings suggest branding and promotional strategies Application This case would be appropriate for undergraduate students who study franchising, distribution channels, reputation, and business ethics. Key Words Franchising, Reputation, Boycott, Dairy Industry, South Korea The authors developed the case for class discussion rather than to illustrate either effective or ineffective handling of the situation. The case was anonymously peer reviewed for presentation at the 34th Annual ISoF Conference – Virtual Conference, May 25-26. Introduction Namyang Dairy Products Co., Ltd. (hereafter “Namyang”) is the second-largest dairy manufacturer in South Korea (Dairy Market News Letter 2020). Namyang was established in 1964 as a baby formula manufacturer, and the company has grown to control about 16% of the milk market share (Seoul Dairy Cooperative n.d.). It has extensive product lines including milk, baby formulas, beverages, coffee, and various dairy products (Namyang Company n.d.). In the 1970s, the company sponsored the excellent children competition, and its successful marketing effort allowed the company to hold a strong brand position in the baby formula industry. Namyang’s milk sales started to take off after the company’s sensational product launch of “Einstein” milk which contains DHA in the 1990s (Namyang Company n.d.). However, consumers have boycotted the company since the Namyang scandal in 2013. Restoring brand reputation has been challenging, and the company has collaborated with other companies to disassociate itself from the negative brand image. A Well-Established Korean Distribution Tactic: MireonaegiMany dairy manufacturers in Korea manage a hybrid distribution system. Since a dairy distribution system needs to handle products from receiving to dispatch with high speed and precision, the manufacturers directly handle their distribution to major retailers for larger supplies and military units. Local franchisees that are allowed exclusive dealing of manufacturers’ products are often in charge of supplying milk to schools and local businesses and delivering dairy products to individual households.  Like any principal and agent relationship, Namyang has faced various conflicts with their franchisees. Mireonaegi, a well-established business strategy in South Korea, was not an unexpected or unprecedented move from Namyang to its franchisees. In fact, the Korean Fair Trade Commission charged a penalty to the company for its unfair trade practices in 2007 (Korea Fair Trade Commission n.d.b).  The direct translation of mireonaegi would be ‘unreasonable coercion to purchase.’ In an exclusive franchising relationship, manufacturers aggressively penetrate their new product in the market or force their franchisees to shoulder difficult to handle inventories by using mireonaegiThen franchisees need to pay for delivered products and to try to sell excessive products quickly by utilizing various promotions, such as 1+1 bundling sales, or donate products in order to minimize their losses. Franchisors’ superior bargaining position, which is innate in asymmetry power dynamics, have allowed the franchisor to continually take advantage of its franchisees.  The 2013 Namyang Scandal On January 26, 2013, three former and current Namyang franchisees filed a case at the Korea Fair Trade Commission for the company’s violation of the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act of Korea. The case was based on unreasonable coercion to purchaseand pressure to give rice cake cash gifts for the holidays to Namyang’s headquarters salespeople. Franchisees accused that Namyang had manipulated the ordering system and repeatedly delivered 200% more products than ordered quantity in order to meet the company’s sales goals. Due to the short shelf life, the franchisees had to discard the unsold products and be responsible for a significant loss. Throughout this process, the company had threatened franchisees that it would reject a renewal of their franchising contracts if franchisees did not accept the excessive amount of delivery (Park 2013a). A former franchisee also accused that the company compelled him to solely pay 70% of expenses for a promotion salesperson, who was working at a large retail chain, while the retailer covered 30% of the salary (Kang 2013). The franchisee claimed that the company forcibly pressured him to compensate a promotion salesperson.  A couple days later, about thirty franchisees rallied against the alleged unfair practices of Namyang in front of the company’s headquarters. Namyang sued the three former and current franchisees who filed a case at the Korea Fair Trade Commission for defamation. The company claimed that those three franchisees during the rally distributed false information including excessive mireonaegi, pressure for rice cake cash gifts during the holidays and illegal rebates. However, this did not receive much attention from either the media or the public. On May 3, 2013, an abusive conversation between a Namyang salesperson and a franchisee went viral on a social media platform. The salesperson, who is in his 30s, used abusive language to the 53 year-old franchisee while the salesperson talked about franchisees’ responsibilities for mireonaegi. Soon, an additional voice recording which asked for rice cake cash gifts for the holidays was released (Yonhap News Agency 2013). The association of convenience store franchisees started a boycott for the entire Namyang products as a group. Within two weeks, Namyang’s dairy product sales decreased 15% compared to the same time in the previous year. Namyang’s market competitors enjoyed an increase in sales due to a substitutional effect as the boycott continued, and it lowered their market share gaps (Kim, B-J 2013).  The public recognized this as a strong case of Gabjil, which is referred to as “an arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in South Korea who have positions of power over others (Korean Open Dictionary n.d.).” Individuals started to pay more attention to unfair trade practices in franchisor-franchisee relationships that are based on asymmetry power dynamics in nature. The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Korea confiscated and searched Namyang. The prosecutors secured documents related to product distribution, accounting books, reports, and computer hard disks (Jung, 2013). Namyang publicly apologized for its wrongdoings. However, individuals did not believe its public apology was sincere. The chairman, the figurehead of the Korean Chaebeol Conglomerate, did not join the event. Namyang then discussed to resolve the issue with its franchisee association after its stock prices declined and consumers started to boycott its products. During that process, Namyang’s involvement in the process of establishing a franchisee association was revealed, and franchise victims created a separate association as a result (Park 2013b). The company sued the former franchisee who released a transcript of Namyang’s unreasonable mireonaegi for a violation of the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilization and Information Protection (Herald Pop 2013). The Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Korea found a legal advisory opinion that was written in 2011 from the confiscated documents. The document stated that “it may be illegal if the company forcibly required franchisees to purchase more than what they actually ordered.” The document was also signed by the CEO. Thus, Namyang’s denials of the mireonaegi business practices to the public broke consumers’ remaining trust (Jung, 2013), even though Namyang publicly apologized for its wrongdoings. On July 8, 2013, the Korea Fair Trade Commission found evidence that supported the franchisees’ allegations regarding Namyang’s unreasonable coercion to purchase and coercion to provide benefits (Thomson Reuters Practical Law 2013). The commission imposed a penalty of 12.3 billion KRW (10.9 million USD). The company agreed to compensate losses from unfair business practices to its franchisees and to financially support franchisees who suffered damage due to the boycott. The Namyang franchise victims’ alliance agreed to drop the lawsuits against Namyang and its employee (Kim, T-J 2013). Many individuals naively believed that the underdogs finally won, and that Namyang and its franchisees had found a happy medium. On January 30, 2015, Namyang filed a lawsuit for canceling the 12.3 billion KRW (10.9 million USD) penalty against the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The Seoul Central District Court judge denied the illegality of Namyang’s unreasonable coercion to purchase and canceled all portions exceeding 500 million KRW (441 thousand USD). Later, the former franchisee filed a case to the Korean Fair Trade Commission again. In early 2020, the Korean Fair Trade Commission publicly notified that the commission had worked with Namyang to correct its unfair trade practices. The company agreed to improve its relationships and business practices with franchisees. The proposed resolution guarantees franchisees’ rights to establish an association, and any major changes of items in the franchise contract would be consulted with the franchisee association (FTC News 2020).  The Korea Fair Trade Commission’s Competition Policy According to the Korea Fair Trade Commission, unfair trade practices are defined as “trading conducted unfairly or unjustly, which may limit free competition in the market (Korea Fair Trade Commission n.d. a).”  The Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act in Article 23 stated that “No business entity shall do any of the following acts that are likely to hinder fair trade, or require its affiliates or other business entities to do such act: (1) Unfairly refusing a transaction or discriminating against a certain transaction partner, (2) Unfairly excluding competitor, (3) unfairly soliciting or coercing customers of competitors to make transactions with it, (4) Making a transaction with a certain transaction partner unfairly taking advantage of its bargaining position, (5) Making a transaction under terms and conditions that unfairly restrict business activities of a transaction partner or disruption business activities of other business entities, (6) Assisting a related party or other company by doing any of the following acts: (a) Providing advanced payments, loans, human resources, real estate, securities, goods, services, intangible property rights, etc. for the related party or other company or making a transaction with the related party or other company under substantially advantageous terms; (b) Making a transaction through the related party or other company, acting as an intermediary, that does not play a practical role in the transaction, despite making such transaction with other business entity is substantially advantageous, (7) Any act that is likely to hinder fair trade, other than those listed in subparagraphs 1 through 6. (Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act n.d.).”  Even though Namyang’s unfair trade practices were found in 2013 by the Korea Fair Trade Commission, the Seoul Central District Court judge denied the allegation toward unreasonable mireonaegi. The company avoided legal consequences of its unreasonable mireonaegi. Its franchisees claimed that they have not been fully compensated from the financial damage that were created by the unreasonable coercion to purchase and coercion to provide benefits. Also, current franchisees who are members of the Namyang franchise victims’ alliance have been excluded from ongoing training and promotional items by Namyang (Lee, Lee, and Chang 2015). Owner Risk: Wrong Visions and Wrongdoings  Like many Chaebol companies in Korea, the founder of Namyang gave ownership of the company to his first son, Chairman Hong, Won Seek. In 2003, he was restricted and released for an accusation of receiving a large amount of illegal rebates from construction companies to create a slush fund. He then rescued himself from the management role by hiring a new CEO, Kim, Yoong, to shift public attention. However, the company had always found quick solutions in order to disengage with social controversies including unfair dealings with its franchisees, fixing and illegal rebates, noise and obscene marketing practices, and trademark infringement allegations. The public does not trust the company’s numerous public apologies. This is especially true after an employee’s claim during a training event that went viral on Twitter that stated, “[h]aving the largest share of the market is not possible without breaking the law.” (Seoul Shinmum 2013; KoreaBang n.d.).  Reputation Management: Ongoing Scandals and Boycotts  Since the 2013 Namyang Scandal, unreasonable mireonaegi in franchisor-franchisee relationships has received more public attention. Focusing on rapid growth in Korea’s economy now has shifted to healthy and balanced growth for all entities. Consumers tend to practice social justice by boycotting brands and products when unfair business practices go viral. Namyang has never recovered its sales in the dairy industry, and the company has tried its best to disassociate with its brands. Instead of promoting dairy products that are associated with its brand name, the company has promoted its sales by expanding the Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) business, Namyang F&B, which was established in 2011 to expand its beverage product lines. Since consumers are less likely to recognize a brand of an original equipment manufacturer, Namyang was able to generate profits by disassociating itself from infamous brands. In 2019, Namyang F&B even changed its brand name into “Healthy People Inc.” However, consumers have demanded Namyang’s business partners (e.g., convenient store chains and retailers), who hired Namyang as an original equipment manufacturer to produce retailers’ private branded products, to switch their partners (Kim 2020).                                                                Foxxcon is the original equipment manufacturer of iPhone, but end consumers are less likely to recognize brand names of OEMs.Moreover, the company started Baekmidang 1964, a milk & ice cream café, in 2014 and rapidly expand its business through franchising. However, many consumers have shared information about the relationship between Namyang and Baekmidang 1964 to encourage boycotting Namyang’s unrevealed businesses. Baekmidang 1964 entered into Hong Kong and China by signing a master franchise agreement with the New World Group (Lee 2019).  Figure 1 Namyang Dairy Products Co. Stock Prices (Source: Google Finance) Conclusion Several mireonaegi cases, such as Baesangmyun Brewery, CU convenience store, Hyundai Mobis, have received attention (Lee, Lee, and Chang 2015). Even though courts have ruled favorably toward franchisors that have strong legal counsels and financial resources, franchisors have to pay huge social punishments by consumers. Namyang’s scandal demonstrates that consumers do not always move on from companies’ wrongdoings.

INTRODUCTIONOver the last decade, CSR literature has placed increasing attention on the effect of CSRon performance. While the impact of CSR on financial performance is weak, researchersseem to agree that CSR positively impacts the brand, reputation, and the goodwill of acompany undertaking CSR initiatives. Despite the substantial contributions of this streamof literature, there are three important gaps that this paper seeks to address in relation tofranchising networks: First, there are very few studies that focus on implementation of CSR in thefranchise settings. Franchising is a form of contractual relationship of legally independentbut  socially  and  economically  interdependent  franchisors  and  franchisees  (Michael,2013).  Franchisor  as  a  creator  of  the  concept  leads  CSR  initiatives  and  requirescommitment of franchisees to implement them. CSR programs are not part of a typicalfranchise contract and thus implementation of CSR in franchising networks is left to thediscretion of the franchisees. Similar issues were investigated in the context of supplychains, where the focal company has limited opportunity to introduce and control theimplementation  of  CSR  initiatives  down  the  value  chain.  Despite  calls  for  moreinvestigation of CSR in franchising (Combs, Ketchen, Shook, and Short, 2011; Michael,2013), the number of studies investigating CSR practices in franchising is very limited(e.g., Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot, Oxibar, & Déjean, 2015).  Second, while the relationship between CSR and various brand constructs hasbeen investigated in several studies, no research investigated the impact of CSR on brandcompetitiveness.  Brand  competitiveness  is  meaningful  when  comparing  competingbrands in a marketplace and is an important indicator of brand performance. This study isthe  first  to  present  empirical  evidence  of  relationship  between  CSR  and  brandcompetitiveness. Third,  prior  work  has  largely  focused  on either  franchisor’s  or  franchisees’perspective  of  brand.  In  reality  the  franchise  brands  are  co-created  by  multiplestakeholders:  franchisors,  franchisees,  employees  and  consumers,  who  play  role  asrecipients  and  co-creators  of  brand  benefits  (Ghantous  and  Christodoulides,  2020).Following the call for more research to enrich the current framework to include views ofother  stakeholder  groups,  we  adopt  the  co-creation  concept  of  brand  and  usecrowdsourcing to collect consumer brand assessments, additionally to brand assessmentsby the franchisors collected through a survey methodology. In  summary,  this  paper  pursues  the  objective  of  studying  the  CSR  brandcompetitiveness  relationship  in  the  franchise  settings  and  in  doing  so  adopts  aninnovative  methodology,  which  uses  alternative  measures  of  CSR,  as  well  ascrowdsourcing of brand data from consumers in addition to using a more traditionalsurvey approach for data collection.  We  use  empirical  data  from  Austrian  franchising  networks,  as  well  ascrowdsourced consumer data, to perform an innovative analysis to test our hypotheses onrelationship between CSR and brand competitiveness. First, we run the cluster analysisusing Carroll’s (1979) pyramid of corporate responsibilities and classify the franchisingfirms  in  two  groups:  franchise  companies  that  prioritize  economic  objectives  andfranchise companies that pursue a more balanced approach to economic, legal, ethicaland discretionary responsibilities. We find that the firms with a more balanced approachtowards CSR have higher brand competitiveness as compared to firms that focus more oneconomic objectives. Second, we run regression analysis and find that CSR measured ontwo dimensions “proactive CSR” and “partner preference” varies positively with brandcompetitiveness. Our study contributes to both CSR and franchising literature by beingthe first to document the role of CSR for brand competitiveness. The article is organized in five sections. Section 2 presents theory and formulatestestable hypotheses. We discuss the methodology in Section 3 and present the analysisand findings of the empirical study in Section 4. In Section 5 we conclude the article bypresenting some directions for the future research. THEORY AND HYPOTHESESCorporate Social ResponsibilityThere is no single definition of CSR (Vilanova, Lozano, & Arenas, 2009), however, thescope of CSR starts from the boundaries of minimum legal requirement and is mainlyrelated to firm’s discretionary actions in order to contribute towards the common socialgoals (Lindgreen, Xu, Maon, & Wilcock, 2012). Adoption of CSR initiatives starts fromreaction and defence, goes towards accommodation and proaction (Wilson, 1975; Carroll,1979). While reactive CSR aims mainly at regulatory compliance, proactive CSR aims atgoing beyond regulatory requirements and taking active role in solving societal problems(Chang, 2015). We adopt the definition by Torugsa, O’Donohue and Hecker (2013) thatproactive  CSR  represents  voluntary  activities  to  simultaneously  support  sustainableeconomic, social, and environmental development above the required compliance level.  The existing CSR literature can be divided into two main streams. The first streaminvestigates  the factors explaining  the motivations  and organizational  characteristicsinfluencing implementation of CSR programs. The second stream largely focuses oninvestigating the performance outcomes and consequences of implementation of CSRprograms (Du, Bhattacharya, & Sen, 2010). The firms may benefit from CSR in severalways: CSR implementation may support brand building efforts of the firms by creating amore positive view  of the products and business activities  and may encourage thecustomers and other stakeholders to place higher trust in the firm by seeking employment(Greening and Turban, 2000) or investing in the firm (Sen, Bhattacharya, & Korschun,2006). A firm can focus on its CSR activities by creating a balance between social andeconomic goals, and by its commitment to engage in activities beyond minimum legalrequirement  (Sen,  Bhattacharya,  &  Korschun,  2006).  A  firm  with  superior  CSRperformance has better access to financing due to reduced agency costs and reducesinformation asymmetry (Cheng, et al., 2014). Ultimately, engaging in CSR is in the self-interest of the firm for longer term viability (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). There are certainstudies that evidence positive relationship between CSR and improved reputation of thebusiness (Fombrun, Gardberg, & Barnett, 2000; Melo & Garrido-Morgado, 2012). TheCSR implementation may also have positive relationship with commitment of employees(Brammer, Millington, & Rayton, 2007; T. B. Porter, 2008) and lower level of employeeturnover (DeTienne, Agle, Phillips, & Ingerson, 2012). However, the findings of the pastCSR research are quite heterogeneous. Several studies present mixed findings regardingthe relationship between implementation of CSR and economic performance (Balabanis,Phillips,  &  Lyall,  1998;  Flammer,  2015;  Kiessling,  Isaksson,  &  Yasar,  2015).Contradictory findings range from positive to negative relation (Margolis and Walsch,2003 and Margolis et al., 2007), U-shaped (Barnett and Salomon, 2012) and inverse U-shaped relation. The mixed nature of the findings can be explained by the fact that thesestudies have been conducted in different settings, use different aspects of CSR andperformance measurement (e.g. Chatterji et al (2016) show that the  six most popularsocial ratings correlate poorly), as well as due to important theoretical and empiricallimitations (McWilliams and Siegel, 2000) like stakeholder mismatching, measurementerrors, and omitted variable bias.  In summary, the past literature suggests that CSR implementation may or may nothave direct relationship with economic performance of the firm, but more probably mayhave an indirect effect though influencing consumer perceptions, brand equity, andcorporate  reputation.  The  amount  of  literature  on  relationship  between  CSR  andcompetitiveness is rather limited and these studies approach competitiveness from afinancial perspective and focus on documenting empirically  the  relationship betweenfinancial performance and CSR (Vilanova, Lozano, & Arenas, 2009).2.2.  Brand competitiveness Brand competitiveness is defined as a brand’s possession of competitive advantage, theability to outperform competitors by providing better value through a combination ofprice and product/service quality (Winzar at al, 2018). The construct is meaningful whencomparing  competing  brands  in  a  marketplace.  Recent  research  has  focused  oninvestigating the drivers of brand competitiveness (Gupta et al, 2020). Implementation of CSR initiatives may result in higher competitiveness becauseof increased the brand awareness and strength. Previous research focused on relationshipsbetween CSR and brand credibility, brand equity, corporate reputation (Hur, Kim &Woo, 2014); brand attachment, brand attitude, purchase intention (Kull and Heath, 2016),brand financial performance (Lai et al, 2010), service brand loyalty (He and Li, 2011),brand trust, brand affect and brand loyalty (Singh et al, 2012). These studies wereconducted  in different empirical settings:  in the service industries  (He & Li, 2011),consumer goods (Singh, Iglesias & Batista-Fogu, 2012; Hur, Kim and Woo, 2014) andbusiness-to-business markets (Lai et al, 2010). Some brands provide an opportunity totheir consumers to choose a charitable action to which the brand will donate in responseto the consumer’s purchase, providing an evidence of the CSR and brand relationship(Kull and Heath, 2015). The brand name is one of most important intangible assets a firm can base itscompetitive advantage on (Aaker, 1989; Hall, 1993). In franchising, brand name is animportant intangible asset that has a  direct  effect on franchise network’s performance(Gorovaia and Windsperger, 2013; Nyadzayo, Matanda & Ewing, 2015). No research onthe relationship between CSR and brand competitiveness has been done in the franchisingcontext and this paper addresses this gap.2.3. Combining brand co-creation with crowdsourcingIn marketing literature the idea of a company-centred and company-controlled brand hasbeen gradually replaced by the concept of a multi-stakeholder co-creation of brands(Ramaswamy & Ozcan, 2016; Zhang, Jiang, Shabbir & Du, 2015). Brand co-creationassumes active role of individuals and “explicit recognition of individual human beingsas “experiencers” of the brand” (Ramaswamy and Ozcan, 2016). Digitally empoweredconsumers  disrupted  the conventional model of brand management from a one-wayprocess  to  a  more  complex,  multi-stakeholder  joint  creation  process.  Recentdevelopments in high tech platforms and social media facilitated communication with thecrowds. Crowdsourcing became a powerful strategic tool for brands to extend and expandbrand value because of firm’s ability to communicate with brand communities (Bal et al,2017). Crowdsourcing is based on Surowiecki’s idea of “wisdom of crowds” (2004):decisions taken by a large group, even if the individuals within the group aren't smart, arealways better than decisions made by small numbers of  “experts”.  Surowiecki relates ananecdote that during a county’s fair visitors were asked to guess the weight of an ox, andwhile none of them was able to guess the weight correctly, the mathematical average ofall the answers, revealed the number without an error. Crowdsourcing engages consumers by asking them to become part of brand co-creation  and  provides  dynamic  marketing  opportunities  for  brands.  According  toGhantous and Christodoulides (2020) empirical research studying brand perceptions andsimultaneously using data from multiple stakeholders remains scarce. We address the gapby using the data on franchise brands from two stakeholder sources: the franchisors andthe consumers.      2.4 Hypotheses Proactive CSR is defined as business strategies and practices that are adopted voluntarilybeyond regulatory requirements in order to support economic, social and environmentalprinciples of sustainable development (Torugsa et al, 2012). We argue that franchisingfirms being network organizations differ in the their implementation of CSR initiatives:Firstly, the franchisor’s proactive CSR strategy is going to impact the scale and scope ofCSR  initiatives  within  the  network.  Secondly,  support  of  CSR  activities  by  thefranchisees is crucial for the success of implementation.   CSR initiatives may result in positive perception of the brand in the minds ofstakeholders (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2004; Torres, Bijmolt, Tribó, & Verhoef, 2012) andmay  increase  their  loyalty  and  recommendation.  Innovative  ideas  on  recycling,sustainable efforts, fair sourcing are more likely to draw the attention of customers and,therefore, improve brand awareness and brand perception among them. Therefore, it isvery important for a franchise system to incorporate CSR values into its corporatestrategy.  While  these  practices  may  have  different  level  of  engagement  includingrecognizing the responsibility of the firm beyond generating profits and meeting theminimum legal requirement, we argue that the franchisor’s proactive CSR strategy willresult in increased brand competitiveness of a franchise system. H1:  Franchisor’s  proactive  corporate  social  responsibility  has  a  positiverelationship with brand competitiveness.The franchisor as a recruiter of new franchisees can facilitate CSR initiatives by selectingfranchise partners with proven commitment to CSR. Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012)observed that franchise companies, being network organisations, are different  in theirimplementation of CSR programs. CSR is not a part of a typical franchise contract andfranchisees have no legal obligation to implement CSR programs. Previous research has highlighted the difficulties of adopting CSR initiatives insupply chains, where a socially responsible company attempts to persuade supply chainpartners to implement CSR or select partners based on their fulfilment of CSR requisites(Cruz, 2009; Ciliberti, De Haan, De Groot, & Pontrandolfo, 2011). The problem ofimplementing CSR initiatives  in franchising companies is in many  ways similar: afranchisor cannot pressure franchisees to implement a CSR program, but can encourageand convince them to do so. Cooperation of franchisees is crucial for the success ofadoption and implementation of CSR initiatives  (Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012). Toensure a smooth implementation of a network-wide CSR strategy, franchise partners mustshare  commitment  to  social  and environmental  causes. It  is more  efficient  for thefranchisors to implement CSR programs in a centralized way if the franchise partnersbelieve in the value of CSR and are committed. In addition, franchisors with better CSRperformance  may  also  be  more  attractive  for  franchisees  due  to  improved  image(Perrigot, et al., 2015) and attract franchisees will higher capabilities and resources toimprove the brand competitiveness of the system. Therefore, we argue that in selection ofthe franchise partners, their commitment to CSR plays an important role. By focusing onpartnerships between franchisors and franchisees in implementing CSR initiatives, ourpaper  contributes  to  the  literature  on  collaborations  in  fostering  CSR  in  inter-organizational settings (Svendsen & Laberge, 2005; Murillo & Lozano, 2009; Phillips,2010).   Hence, we propose the following hypothesis:H2: Franchise partners with proven commitment to CSR will positively impact brand competitiveness.  METHODOLOGY3.1. Data collectionThe data for this research was collected from two sources: a survey of the Austrianfranchisors and a survey of the crowd about their perceptions of the Austrian franchisebrands. We first obtained the list of all the franchise systems in Austria from the AustrianFranchise Association (AFA). The AFA identifies 311 franchise systems in Austria in2014. After several preliminary steps in questionnaire development, including interviewswith the representatives of AFA and few franchise professionals, the questionnaire waspre-tested with 10 franchisors in Vienna. The final questionnaire was sent out to themanagers of the franchise organizations by post. The data were obtained through a keyinformant approach  (McKendall & Wagner III, 1997). Key informants for this  surveywere senior managers of the franchise organizations who are mainly responsible formanagement of franchise networks and expansion. The information about key informantswas retrieved from the list of franchise companies obtained from AFA. Additionally, anonline  version  of the  questionnaire  was  made  available  to  the  respondents  on thehttps://www.soscisurvey.de and a link for online survey was sent via e-mail to all 311franchise systems. Three weeks later, we sent reminders via e-mail to the companies thathad not responded. In the process of data collection, we found out that 31 franchisecompanies did not have franchised outlets or did not use franchising anymore. Thisreduced  our  target  population  to  280  systems.  Altogether,  we  received  65  usableresponses reflecting a response rate of 23%, which is consistent with comparable studiesusing  key  informant  methodology.  We  compared  the  early  respondents  to  the  laterespondents to test for non-response bias, where late respondents served as proxy for non-respondents  (Armstrong & Overton, 1977). We did not find any differences between thetwo groups of respondents. The second survey was addressed to the crowd and was distributed through socialmedia in various Austrian online communities, including Austrian students’ community.Social media platforms are very appealing to crowdsourcing because they are widelyused, accessible, and cost-effective (Afuah and Tucci, 2012).  Participants of the surveywere from the general public anonymous to the researchers. The participants were shownthe graphic and textual representation of a brand and asked to evaluate it compared to itscompetitors. Participants could skip a brand, if they had insufficient experience with it.Each brand received a different number of assessments from min 87 to max 238 with anaverage of 142 assessments per brand. To construct the index we calculated averages ofcustomers’ assessments. Crowdsourcing is recommended as a method when the researchquestion  is  straightforward,  easily  defined,  and  can  be  reasonably  expected  to  beunderstood by the general public or when the question aims to measure public sentiment.It is the best method when value is placed on diversity of opinion (Flostrand, 2017). Mostof the studies on franchising used a company-centred and company-controlled concept ofbrand and collect brand-related data from one source, namely the franchisors. In thispaper the brand data is collected from two sources: from the franchisors and from theconsumers, which is consistent with the brand co-creation concept. 3.2.MeasurementThe survey administered to franchisors requested information on proactive economic,social and environmental attitudes of franchisors, beyond those legally required andcompliance-driven.  Furthermore,  we  requested  descriptive  data,  e.g.  the  year  ofestablishment and total number employees at headquarters. To test the hypotheses thefollowing variables were used: brand competitiveness (Brand), proactive CSR (PCSRpreferred partner (Partner), age of the franchise system () and size of the franchisesystem (Size3.2.1. Dependent VariableBrand competitiveness  (Brand) was adopted from previous empirical studies in thefranchise context (Combs & Ketchen, 2004; Barthélemy, 2008). Four items on a seven-point Likert-type scale  operationalize  the construct of brand name  competitiveness.Brand competitiveness was measured as an average index of all items, consisting offranchisors’ and customers’ brand assessments. Franchisors and customers were asked torate the systems on brand strength compared to competitors, brand recognition comparedto competitors, reputation for quality, and the importance of brand name for achievingcompetitive advantage. 3.2.2. Predictor Variables CSR  is  an  elusive  concept  to  define  and  to  operationalize.  Various  theories  likesustainable development theory, stakeholder management theory contributed to differentoperationalisations of CSR, as well  creation of related concepts such as sustainabledevelopment, corporate social performance, corporate citizenship, which resulted in CSRliterature being blurred and disconnected (Perez and Rodriguez del Bosque, 2013).  We measured CSR concept in two ways: first, we operationalised CSR constructbased on Carroll’s pyramid of responsibilities (1979), second, to capture the proactivedimension of CSR policies, and choice of partners committed to CSR, we used reflectivemeasurement scales. Following Carroll (1979), we asked the respondents of the survey tospecify  what  percentage  they  give  to  each  of  the  four  categories  (economicresponsibilities, legal responsibilities, ethical behaviour and philanthropy), with a total of100%. Following Torugsa, O’Donohue and Hecker (2013) we defined proactive CSR asvoluntary  activities  to  support  sustainable  economic,  social  and  environmentaldevelopment beyond compliance level.  We have two predictor variables in our model: proactive CSR (PCSR) and partnerpreference  (Partner). To operationalize  proactive  CSR (PCSR), a set of items  thatdescribe the variable is needed. The items have to be grounded in theory and relevant tothe franchise context. We base our variables on the measures used in the previous studies(Luo, 2006; Park & Ghauri, 2015). In the first step, we define PCSR based on review of academic literature (Keinert,2008). In the second step, we develop a comprehensive set of items that characterizeproactive  economic,  social  and  environmental  attitudes  of  franchisors,  above  thoselegally  required  and  compliance-driven.  We  discussed  all  the  items  with  franchisepractitioners and adapted the formulation of the questions to the franchise context. In the third step, we perform a principal component analysis of all the CSR andbrand items in order to reduce the number of explanatory variables and allow a groundedclassification  of  CSR  components,  rather  than  to  accept  one  of  the  contradictingdefinitions of CSR.  Three factors emerged with large eigenvalues (4.346, 1.747 and1.463) and together accounted for 69 percent of total variance. The factor loadings afterare listed in Table 1. All factors have high factor loadings above 0.626.The analysis of the factor loadings suggests that the first factor captures proactiveCSR commitment  to economic, social,  and environmental  causes  above the legallyrequired, the second factor highlights that commitment to social and environmentalcauses  makes  a  company  a  preferred  partner.  The  third  factor  represents  brandcompetitiveness.  3.2.3. Control VariablesOrganization size has been shown as a fundamental predictor of whether the organizationengages in CSR or not  (Wang, Gao, Hodgkinson, Rousseau, & Flood, 2015). Keinert(2008, p. 139) argues that small and medium enterprises do not engage in CSR due totheir struggle for growth and survival. We measure the size of the franchise system (Sizeas the number employees working in the headquarters of the franchise system. Largerfranchise systems are more likely to pursue CSR initiatives and result in higher brandcompetitiveness. Size of the franchising firm is also associated  with resources andcapabilities of the franchise network (Combs, Michael, & Castrogiovanni, 2004). We also control for the age of the franchise system ( is measured by thenumber of years since the opening of the first franchise outlet. Age is a proxy for inter-organizational learning and experience (Gulati & Sytch, 2008). Older franchise systemsare more likely to pursue CSR initiatives and hence increase the brand competitiveness. is  also  traditionally  seen  as  associated  with  firm’s  resources  and  capabilitiesparticularly is franchising (Oxenfeldt & Kelly, 1968; Combs, et al., 2004). <Insert Table 1 Here>3.4.Construct Validity We use multi-item scales for measuring PCSRPartner and Brand competitiveness. check convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs we estimated the averageintra-construct correlation as a ‘‘within measure’’ and the average correlation of eachconstruct’s items with each other construct’s items as a ‘‘between measure’’. The resultsare presented in the Table 2. The ‘‘within’’ average correlations are higher than the‘‘between’’ average correlations, providing support of discriminant validity of theseconstructs. Cronbach alpha shows values above the recommended cut-off value of 0.70(Cronbach, 1951): Brand =0.740, PCSR=0.837, Partner=0.870. The 11 items reflecting the three constructs of the proposed model were examinedvia confirmatory factor analysis with the initial analysis indicating only a poor fit: χ71.569 (df  = 41,  < 0.05), comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.90, Tucker-Lewis-index(TLI) of 0.868 and root mean square of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.111. Cross-loadings were examined via modification indices and standardized residuals. Two itemsof the Brand construct (“The quality of our franchise system is very good in comparisonto our competitors” and “Our brand is very strong compared to our competitors”) areconceptually close and thus it is conceptually plausible that the error terms might becorrelated.  We added this  path to the model.  Furthermore,  we added another pathbetween error terms of two items of  Partner  construct (“A franchisee with provencommitment to social and environmental issues is a preferred contractual partner”, “Afranchisor with proven commitment to social and environmental issues is a preferredcontractual  partner”)  which  is  also  conceptually  plausible.  The  CFA  analysis  wasrepeated and resulted in an acceptable fit of the measurement model: χ= 44.124 (39, p =0.264), CFI 0.984, TLI 0.977 and RMSEA 0.047. <Insert Table 2 Here>ANALYSISTable 3 presents descriptive statistics and correlations for the sample. The average our  sample  is  16.38  years  and  the  average  Size is  around  61  employees  in  theheadquarters.<Insert Table 3 Here>We start with the cluster analysis using Carroll’s (1979) pyramid of responsibilities. Thenwe proceed with testing our hypotheses with the regression analysis. 4.1. Cluster AnalysisWe used deductive approach to select the number and suitability of clustering variablesas recommended by Ketchen and Shook (1996).  Following Carroll’s (1979) definition ofCSR, we asked the respondents of the survey to specify what percentage they give toeach  of the four categories  (economic  responsibilities,  legal  responsibilities,  ethicalbehaviour and philanthropy), with a total of 100%. We performed a cluster analysis withthe four clustering variables derived from Carroll (1979) using a two-stage procedureusing Euclidean distances. Two-stage procedure increases validity of solution because itcombines hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods: first, a hierarchical algorithm isused to define the number of clusters and centroids; second, the results from the firststage are used for subsequent non-hierarchical clustering (Ketchen and Shook, 1996).Examination  of  the  dendrogram  indicated  a  two-cluster  solution.  We  checked  therobustness of the finding by re-running the analysis with non-standardized variables, asresults may differ based on standardization, and achieved the same result. We also re-analysed the data using random halves of the total sample and the results were consistentacross sample halves.  Table 4 presents a final cluster solution. A closer analysis of the scores derivedfrom the cluster analysis allows the following observations to be made: the first cluster(44%) consists of franchise companies that have a balanced view and give relativelyequal priorities to their economic, legal, ethical and discretionary responsibilities. Thesecond cluster (56%) consists of franchise companies that give very high priority to theireconomic responsibilities, giving significantly less to legal, ethical and philanthropicresponsibilities. As presented in Table 4, the firms in the first cluster gave more equalimportance to economic, legal, ethical and discretional responsibilities. <Insert Table 4 Here>To assess criterion-related validity we performed T-tests with external variables that werenot  used  in  defining  clusters.  Given  our  emphasis  on  investigating  CSR-brandcompetitiveness  relationship,  the  external  variables  were  brand  competitivenesscomputed as an average of franchisors’ and customers’ brand assessments, as well ascontrol variables, such as age and size of the franchise system. We performed T-tests toinvestigate  the difference between two clusters on brand competitiveness. The firstcluster has a higher Brand score as compared to the second cluster (p<0.1). We found nodifference between the two clusters in terms of Size and Age. Results of T-test analysisare reported in Table 5. <Insert Table 5 Here>4.4. Regression AnalysisTo test  H1 and H2, we employ ordinary least squares regression (OLS) with  BrandCompetitiveness as dependent variable. The dependent variable is measured as an averageof franchisors’ and customers’ brand assessments. The predictor variables are PCSR andPartner. Additionally,  Size and  Age  are included in the regression analysis as controlvariables. We do not find any multi-collinearity indication. We estimate the followingregression equation: Brand = α0 + αAge+ αSizePCSR + αPartner + εWe expect that proactive CSR will positively impact the Brand competitiveness.Furthermore, we also expect that partners with proven commitment to CSR initiativeswill  positively  impact  the  Brand  competitiveness.  Table  6  presents  the  results  ofregression analysis. Model 1 includes only control variables while Model 2 includes bothcontrol and predictor variables. The coefficients of PCSR and Partner with proven commitment to CSR initiativesare  positive  and  highly  significant.  Hence  both  hypotheses  are  supported  by  theregression analysis. Additionally, the coefficient of the Size is positive and significant,indicating  that  larger  franchise  systems  are  more  likely  to  have  stronger  BrandCompetitiveness.   4.5.Cross-validation of Regression ResultsOur sample size of 65 responses exceeds the minimum threshold of 10 observations perpredictor variable  (Harris, 2013) and of total 57 observations for regression analysis(VanVoorhis & Morgan, 2007). To mitigate potential concerns about the validity of ourresults given the small sample size we employed bootstrapping to cross-validate ourmodel. (Woodside, 2013, Harrell, Lee & Mark, 1996, Steyerberg, Eijkemans, Harrell, &Habbema, 2000). This technique is based on extensive resampling from the existingsample and is widely used for cross validation  (Cramer, Bunce, Patterson, & Frank,1988).  We  subjected  our  regression  model  to  2000  repetitions  and  the  confidenceintervals are reported in Table 7. <Insert Table 7 Here>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 5.1. FindingsWe tested the relationship between CSR and brand competitiveness in franchise settings.CSR is measured along the dimensions of proactive CSR and partner preference. We alsoused Carroll’s  (1979) responsibility pyramid to create an alternative measurement ofCSR. The results based on analysis of the empirical data collected from the Austrianfranchise  systems  suggest  a  positive  relationship  between  CSR  and  brandcompetitiveness. Exploratory cluster analysis revealed two clusters of franchise firms:  one groupof the firms has clearly more focus on economic goals, while another group has a morebalancedapproach and focus on all four dimensions of corporate social responsibility(Carroll, 1979). The brand competitiveness of the second cluster is significantly highercompared to the first cluster. We show that a balanced approach toward CSR results inhigher competitiveness of the firm.  Regression analysis revealed that proactive CSR strategy of the franchisor has apositive  impact on brand competitiveness. Proactive CSR strategy results in initiatingCSR programs in the franchise system, which ultimately create more favourable view ofthe brand among consumers. Hence, it strengthens franchisor’s brand in comparison withcompetitors. Regression analysis also showed that franchise partners with commitment to CSRhave positive impact on brand competitiveness. The success or the failure of CSRprograms largely depends on the franchisees and their acceptance of the program. Thefranchisors should consider it at the very beginning of a franchise relationship and selectfranchisees that share commitment to CSR.  On the other hand, it may also be argued thatfranchisors perceive that CSR initiatives will have positive impact on their attractivenessas preferred partners, and that they can leverage benefits on their CSR reputation byattracting better franchisees. 5.2. ContributionsOur findings contribute towards the franchise literature  by shedding more light on theexisting CSR-performance relationship. First, we extend the existing stream of literatureon performance outcomes of CSR in general and corporate competitiveness in particular(M. E. Porter & Kramer, 2006) by presenting empirical evidence from a business sector,where brand is relatively more important and brand management is unique (Pitt, et al.,2003). The past research also calls for further investigation into different dimensions ofperformance  implications  of  CSR  in  order  to  enhance  the  understanding  of  thephenomenon  (Brammer & Millington, 2008). Second, we address the call for furtherresearch into business ethics in franchising in order to enhance the ethical dimension ofthe franchising research (Combs, et al., 2011) and improve our understanding how theconcept of corporate social responsibility applies to a franchise chain (Michael, 2013).We argue that CSR has a positive impact on brand competitiveness. Our contributions are also methodological: we use an innovative measure for CSRbased on Caroll’s pyramid of responsibilities  (Carroll, 1979, 1999). Carroll’s studiesinspired lots of research in CSR, however, no previous study created a measurementmodel utilizing this concept. Our measure enabled us to collect and analyse data based onthe actual decision-making problems firms face while adopting CSR. The franchisorswere  asked  to  allocate  a  percentage  importance  (out  of  100)  to  each  of  the  fourdimensions of CSR. Furthermore,  we used  crowdsourcing and more traditional survey methodologyfor data collection. Compared to previous studies that used either only franchisors’ oronly  franchisees’  brand  assessments,  we follow  the  brand  co-creation  concept  thatconsiders customers brand co-creators by being active experiencers of the brand.  Wecollected the brand competitiveness data from two stakeholder groups: franchisors andcustomers. 5.3. Practical implications The findings have practical implications for the franchisors and franchise-managers. Thefranchisors should balance economic, legal, ethical and discretionary responsibilities andbe proactive in implementation of CSR  programs to achieve  brand competitiveness.Franchisors should also incorporate criteria related to CSR reputation and commitment infranchisee  selection.  Franchisees’  participation  in  CSR  programs  is  critical  forimplementation, makes them preferred partners, and contributes to brand competitivenessat the outlet level.  Effective implementation of CSR will result in increased brandcompetitiveness for the benefit of both franchisors and franchisees. 5.4. LimitationsThis study has certain limitations. First, the sample size is rather small and there might besome concerns about the generalizability of the findings. It would be interesting to testthe similar relationships on larger samples in different cultural contexts and by takinginto account the franchisees’ perspective.  Second, we use subjective measures of brandcompetitiveness based on the perceptions of the franchisors and the customers. While weargue that crowd’s assessment of brand competitiveness are accurate, we have no datafrom other stakeholders like franchisees, employees. Future studies should investigate thebrand co-creation collecting data from other sources and testing the misalignment ofbrand assessments of different stakeholder groups. Third, our study does not differentiatebetween single-unit franchising vs. multi-unit franchising. Multi-unit franchisees arelarger  partners  with  higher  organizational  capabilities  and  resources  (Hussain  &Windsperger, 2010) and they are in a better position to implement CSR programs moreeffectively as compared with single-unit franchisees (Meiseberg & Ehrmann, 2012). Thefuture research may also explore the differences among different forms of franchising interms of CSR implementation and organizational performance.

Keywords International franchising, antecedents of international franchisor’s strategy, standardization and adaptation degree of strategy  1. Introduction Franchising is a known strategy for business growth, job creation, and economic development, and has been a common way for companies to enter foreign markets or expand internationally (Dant and Gruenhagen, 2014). Similar as in common international companies co-alignment of strategy and structure is important for operations and performance of international franchising networks. Apparently, various factors like culture, brand reputation, trust, and knowledge sharing are highly critical for gaining fit between strategy and structure in franchising networks (Alon et al., 2012). For achieving fit between strategy, structure and performance international franchising companies needs to take a closer look on their international strategy. Especially important in franchising networks is the decision whether to use standardization or adaptation strategy when entering an unknown or foreign market. So far, franchising research hardly explored the influencing factors for the standardization versus adaptation of strategies, and their fit with firm structure in foreign countries. Standardization is a fundamental characteristic of franchising as a business format (Kaufmann and Eroglu, 1999). Business format franchising is characterized through a constant tension between the franchisor, who strives for standardization in order to achieve uniform corporate activities and economies of scale, and franchisees, who need local adaptation of certain business format features for market satisfaction (Fock, 2001). Differences between markets exist in terms of production conditions, labor costs, nature of firm activities and other regional conditions, which need to be accommodated in the local franchise operations through strategy adaptation (North and Smallbone, 1995; Smallbone et al., 1993; Vaessen and Keeble, 1995). The franchisor wants to preserve consistency of a high quality standard of products/services and its goodwill and brand equity among the franchise system, whereas the franchisees asks for independence (Dant and Gundlach, 1999). Usually franchisors regulate core components of the system and franchisees are responsible for peripheral components (Kaufmann and Eroglu, 1999), such as product-mix, pricing, marketing and human relations, which they adapt to fit the local market requirements (Cox and Mason, 2007). However, adaptations of a format can damage the franchise’s competitive advantages, brand name and consistency (Sorenson and Sørensen, 2001, Choo, 2001). While standardization of a strategy positively impact economies of scale and consumers’ brand identification it can have a negative impact on local sales, when the franchise product or service is not conform with the host market environment conditions (Alon, 2004).Thus, the aim of this paper is to identify the antecedents of international franchisor’s degree of standardization/adaptation strategy, or in other words: which variables/factors influence the choice of franchisor’s international strategy. The goal is to define those parameters, which help international franchising companies to choose standardization or adaptation strategy in preparation of successfully entering a new host country or market.  2. Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses development Our research model about the antecedents of the international strategy of franchise firms is based on hypotheses derived from cultural theory, transaction cost theory and resource-based theory. It is summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1. Research ModelCultural theory hypothesisAccording to the cultural theory, the national culture of firm headquarters influences the strategies adopted by the international franchise companies (Erramilli, 1996; Hennart and Larimo, 1998). Geert Hofstede developed a frequently used framework for measuring of cultural differences between countries (Morosini et al., 1998) and conducted several studies during last decades to verify the framework (Hofstede, 1984, 1991, 2001). The distinct feature of his framework are the five cultural dimensions which he linked with demographic, geographic, economic, and political aspects of a society and to which he assigned indexes for all nations (Kale and Barnes, 1992). Table 1 describes the five cultural dimensions. Cultural dimension Description Power distance  This dimension reflects the consequences of power inequality and authority relations in society. It influences hierarchy and dependence relationships in the family and organizational contexts. Individualism vs. collectivism This dimension describes the relationships individuals have in each culture. In individualistic societies, individuals look after themselves and their immediate family only whereas in collectivistic cultures, individuals belong to groups that look after them in exchange for loyalty. Uncertainty avoidance  “The extent to which people feel threatened by uncertainty and ambiguity and try to avoid these situations” (Hofstede, 1991, p. 113). This dimension deals with the need for well-defined rules for prescribed behavior. Femininity vs. masculinity Dominant values in masculine countries are achievement and success and in feminine countries are caring for others and quality of life. Short-term vs. long term orientation Long-term orientation “stands for the fostering of virtues oriented towards future rewards, in particular perseverance and thrift” (Hofstede, 2001, p. 359).  Table 1. Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Soares et. al., 2007) Previous research showed that two of Hofstede's dimensions – power distance (PD) and uncertainty avoidance (UA) – influence organizational decision-making in a cross-border context. PD describes how people belonging to a specific culture view power relationships and accept social inequalities (Hofstede, 2001). Managers of franchising companies from countries which score high on power distance are more autocratic and prefer to keep power over strategic decision-making (Erramilli, 1996). UA measures the extent to which people feel uncomfortable in the presence of vagueness and ambiguity (Hofstede, 2001). Managers of franchising companies from countries, which score high on uncertainty avoidance, tend to avoid uncertain situations and pursue control over operations and decisions (Erramilli, 1996). Franchisors feel reluctant to provide adaptation rights to local network partners to prevent adverse situations of brand name hijacking in environmental distant countries (Choo, 2001). Thus, we assume that franchising companies from countries, which score high on  and UA, will prefer standardization strategy, which enables them to exert decision-making control over critical value chain activities of the franchise system such as product mix and quality control. These considerations lead us to the formulation of the first hypothesis.  The international franchise headquarters’ degree of power distance and uncertainty avoidancenegatively influence the adaptation degree of its strategy. Transaction costs hypothesesUncertain business environment is characterized by constantly changing conditions such as of political systems, demand, and competition (Rajan and Pangarkar, 2000; Erramilli et. al, 2002; Brothers and Brothers 2003), and affect companies’ decisions of entry in new markets. The franchisor will pursue an adaptation strategy for franchise partners in order to flexibly modify standardized operating, product and/or service functions and to capture the profit potential in the volatile foreign environments (Boyle, 1999). Besides environmental uncertainty, the cultural differences between countries, such as norms, values, language and habits, hamper the transfer of standardized strategies to foreign countries and require adaptations to the local market environment. The greater the cultural distance between countries, the higher is the cultural uncertainty, and the more important is the franchisor’s strategy to adapt the franchise business model (e.g., operational business practices and personnel management practices) to the host country environment (Fladmoe-Lindquist, 1996; Alon and McKee, 1999).  This reasoning results in the following two hypotheses: H2a: Cultural uncertainty, due to cultural differences between the home country of the franchisor and the host country of the franchisee, positively influences the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.H2b: The environmental uncertainty in host countries positively influences the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.  Resource-based theory hypothesesAccording to the resource-based theory, “a firm is said to have a sustained competitive advantage when it is implementing a value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current potential competitor” (Barney, 1991, p. 120). In franchising competitive advantages can be created through combining the system-specific assets of franchisors with the local market knowledge and resources of franchisees(Windsperger, 2004). Franchise systems which derive competitive advantage from intangible system-specific assets, such as innovation capabilities or product knowledge, will transfer and exploit their system-specific assets to new markets without adapting them. On the other hand, when the franchisees’ local market knowhow and assets, such as local human resources or customer management competences, are critical to gaining a competitive advantage in the host country, then franchisors are more likely to use an adaptation strategy to capitalize on the franchisees' ability to adapt the franchise to the specifics of the country local market. Therefore, depending on the importance of the system-specific/local market assets for the value creation of the franchise brand, the franchisor will prefer a lower/higher degree of adaptation strategy in the host country. We can formulate the following hypotheses: H3a:Franchisor’s system-specific assets negatively influence the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.  H3b:Franchisees’ local market assets positively influence the adaptation degree of the international franchisor’s strategy.  3. Empirical study 3.1. Data collection and measurement Our empirical study was conducted with data from international franchise firms headquartered in eight countries. We identified the international franchise firms with the support of national and international franchise associations of the countries of interest. In total, we contacted 2,713 companies. Starting in December 2014, we sent emails to the selected firms with an electronic link to the online questionnaire in several rounds of surveys. By June 2015, we completed the data collection process, resulting in a cleared data set of 162 international franchise systems headquartered in the US (24), UK (8), Germany (41), Austria (16), Netherlands (10), Italy (18), France (22), and Spain (23).  To test our hypotheses, we applied multiple regression method conducted via IBM SPSS. Table 2 provides an overview of the hypotheses and variables, which are used for testing of the research model (see Figure 1).

Regression analysis results The regression model is highly significant (p = .000, p < 0.05)Our model explains 17,6% (R² = 0.176) of the variance in adaptation degree of strategy. Power distance index (p = .003, ß = .267) (H1a), cultural uncertainty(p= .045, ß = -.185) (H2a), franchisor’s system specific assets (p = .006, ß = .211) (H3a) and franchisee's local assets (p = .006, ß = .199) (H3b) show significant impact on the choice of the international franchise strategy.  The first hypothesis is partly confirmed. The franchisor’s home country culture, i.e., measured by the degree of power distance, significantly impacts adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. However, the results are opposite to our hypothesis. Contrary to hypothesis (H1a), power distance (PD) positively influences adaptation strategy (p = 0.003, ß = .267). However, we find no significant relationship between adaptation strategy and uncertainty avoidance (UA) (p = .749). The regression results show a significant impact of cultural uncertainty adaptation strategy (p = .045, ß = -.185) but surprisingly with a converse result as predicted by our hypothesis (H2a). Cultural uncertainty negatively influences the degree of strategy adaption. Environmental uncertainty shows no significant impact on adaptation degree of franchising strategy (p = .106). Therefore, H2b is rejected.  The results of hypotheses H3a & H3b are significant. Resource-based factors significantly affect adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. Contrary to hypothesis (H3a), franchisor‘s system-specific assets positively impact choice of adaptation strategy (p = 0.006, ß = .211) and in alignment with H3b, the franchisee local assets positively influence choice of adaptation strategy (p = 0.010, ß = .199). 4. Discussion and conclusion Contrary to our hypothesis (H1a), power distance (PDI) positively influences the choice of the adaptation strategy by international franchising companies. Consequently, the higher the PD index of the franchising company‘s home country, the higher is the adaptation degree of strategy in host countries to which franchising company is expanding. Possible interpretation might be that strategies of franchising companies from countries with a high score on PD are difficult to transfer/implement in other countries. For example, human resources strategies from countries, which score high on PD might not be applicable in countries, which score low on PD, because employees of different cultural backgrounds are used to a different management approaches such as highly hierarchical management style versus flat hierarchies. Contrary to hypothesis H2a, cultural uncertainty has a negative, significant effect on adaptation degree of international franchising strategy. One possible interpretation is that franchisors who are unfamiliar with local cultures, norms and values are reluctant to accept changes to their standardized franchise business format due to a cognitive risk perception associated with adapting to the unknown, such as brand hijacking. Contrary to hypothesis (H3a), importance of franchisor‘s system-specific assets positively impact adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. Consequently, the more important the franchisor‘s system-specific assets for value creation, the higher is adaptation degree of strategy in host countries to which franchising companies are expanding. Possible interpretation might be that franchising companies with system-specific assets that are highly important in achieving competitive advantage need to adapt to local markets of host countries more than franchising companies, which do not possess highly important system-specific assets. The product or service of those firms might be highly dependent on e.g., local consumer preferences or local employee management. As hypothesized, importance franchisee‘s local assets (H3b) for value creation positively impacts the adaptation degree of strategy by franchisor in the host countries. High levels of local franchisee‘s know-how consequently results in higher necessity to use the adaptation strategy. In conclusion, Hofstede's power distance score has a newly discovered positive influence on adaptation degree of strategy in international franchising companies. These finding calls for retesting the relationship on a different data sample, for example on data from Eastern or Asian countries, where power distance score can be particularly high. Managers of franchising companies from countries, which score high on power distance need to prepare for adaptation of their international franchising strategy when they expand to other countries/markets. Being aware of it in advance can save international franchising companies many efforts and financial expenses.  Franchising system-specific assets and local market assets are in a recursive relationship. Franchising companies, which have system-specific assets and are entering a business relationship with foreign franchisees, who possess local market knowledge, should pursue an adaptation strategy. In this case, the franchise managers have to adjust the system-specific knowhow to the local market environment in order to gain competitiveness when implementing the franchise business format in new or foreign markets.  This study has several limitations. Our data set consists of 162 international franchisors from eight countries. This data is a snapshot and is not a longitudinal study. The proportion of cases between countries and industries is unequal. Franchise headquarters are all located in developed countries, rather US or Western Europe. 5. Outlook to future research This paper tests the first Part I on the antecedents of international franchising strategy of the general research model shown in Figure 2.  Figure 2. General research model In franchising networks, centralized structure makes implementation of decisions by the franchisor easier. Thereby, one entity, i.e., the franchisor, makes the decisions and spreads it to international franchisees (Berkowitz and Wren, 2013). On the other hand, franchisors that transfer decision-making powers to franchisees can achieve a greater fit between strategy and structure (Xu et al., 2006). Transfer of centralized structure in franchising networks to other markets/countries via franchisees can cause minor decision-making power of franchisors (Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). Centralized structure in franchising is highly efficient in the enforcement of high-quality standards (Wu, 2015). Decentralization of decision-making in franchising networks makes it difficult for management to control the business standards and performance (Yin and Zajac, 2004). Decentralized structure in franchising networks require high control from franchisor HQ to establish fit between strategy and structure resulting in expected performance (Baena, 2012). According to the property rights, approach in franchising, structure of decision rights in franchising networks depends on intangible system-specific assets and the local market assets (Windsperger, 2004). International expansion of franchising companies leads to choice of governance mode such as wholly owned subsidiaries, joint venture franchising, area development franchising and master franchising (Konigsberg, 2008). Each of the governance modes are characterized by certain level of control in terms of ownership, decision, and residual income rights, which franchisor split between headquarter and international franchisees (Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger, 2014). The choice of efficient governance mode depends on the fit between strategy and structure, leading to improvement of performance in international franchising companies (Prajogo, 2016).  Previous studies in international franchising are unable to explain the fit between strategy, structure and organizational performance. Most of the studies have limitations due to the availability of data (Ahmady et al., 2016; Wilden et al., 2013; Baena and Cerviño, 2014). Therefore, this research project has three major goals: identification of antecedents for international franchising strategy, testing of strategy impact on franchising structure and investigation of interaction between strategy, structure and performancein international franchising context.

We argue that the threat of franchisor/franchisee joint employment and its vicarious liability will likely become binding precedent. Franchisors should put systems in place that will mitigate the risks associated with franchising.   Joint Employment and the Development of  Vicarious Liability in Franchising Introduction Without realizing it, all consumers have been to multiple franchises in every industry. Franchising is one of the most popular business models in the market today. While franchising is quite common in the restaurant and hotel industry, it is found in a multitude of industries in U.S. domestic and foreign markets. The symbiotic relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee has allowed for new legal precedents that inevitably create the need to make modifications to the model. In this paper, we argue that the concept of franchisor/franchisee joint employment and its vicarious liability will likely become binding precedent in the U.S. Therefore, franchisors should put systems in place that will mitigate the risks associated with franchising.   Literature Review Franchising is a business model designed to promote rapid expansion. A franchisee is someone who owns a franchise location. A franchisee's success and profit depends significantly on its own performance, but also on the performance of other franchisees. The franchisee operates as a separate legal entity. Franchising circumvents vertical and horizontal agency risks by replacing the employee-manager with a franchisee. While the concept has been around for centuries, the modern format has only become popular since World War II. Franchising                                                   Michael H. Seid, Where it All Began. The Evolution of FranchisingRANCHISE http://www.franchise-chat.com/resources/where_it_all_began_the_evolution_of_franchising.html (n.d.) augmented the rapid expansion that the U.S. market was facing in the 1950s and has continued to develop rapidly today largely under the same framework.Franchisees face life-cycles where they generally start out dependent on the expertise and established product/brand that the franchisor offers. Over time, they grow in their own expertise and develop ambition for more independence and wealth. They may procure it via purchasing more and more outlets, either multi-unit, multi-brand, or multi-system.Franchisors, on the other hand, are heavily influenced by the theory of resource scarcity during the early stages of a system’s existence. Under resource scarcity, franchising is a mechanism to ease financial and managerial constraints on growth, which aids in rapid business expansion. As can be expected, resource scarcity is most present early in the timeline of a franchise’s growth as the franchisor still relies on another agent’s resources to grow. Agency theory becomes more critical during the latter part of a franchise’s life-cycle. Under agency theory, franchising is a mechanism for improving alignment between the firm and outlet-level incentives. Agency theory comprises two classifications: vertical and horizontal. Vertical agency is the idea that employee-managers in company-owned outlets will shirk in order to get                                                   Jennifer S.

Conversely, horizontal agency is the idea that franchisees may free-ride on the brand-building efforts of others in order to draw in consumers.With agency theory, there are a few risks for the franchisor that come with signing a franchising contract. The risks occur either during the selection process or during the time spent operating together. Pre-contract, franchisee candidates may misrepresent themselves in order to get a better deal from the franchisor, otherwise known as adverse selection. Post signing the contract, the issue of “moral hazard” arises, where the residual claimant may cut corners.However, franchising may be the only business model to solve these issues; unlike with the chain business model, any franchisee shortcuts will cause a direct impact as the franchisees own units themselves. Franchising is based on a legal business contract, and the idea of being an independent owner alongside a partner is enticing; many entrepreneurs want to be their own boss and have their own business, but they also like the comfort that comes with the security of having a partner. They do not have to create a business model from scratch, as they have someone to train them on how to run this business; moreover, they believe that this same model was successful in a different unit.

Additionally, there are safeguards against the franchisor taking the franchisee out of business, as twenty-three states have established relationship laws that require franchisors to have “sufficiently good cause for terminating franchisees” or to “protect from arbitrary or baseless termination.” So, while the franchisee relies heavily on the franchisor for the franchisee’s potential and initial success, the franchisor is taking a risk by investing in this separate agent and trusting the franchisee with its brand.Rubin elaborates on the relationship between franchisor and franchisee and their economic and legal agreements. “The franchisor may provide various sorts of managerial assistance to the franchisee… [and] the franchisee will agree to run the business in a manner stipulated by the franchisor… [and] pay royalties, usually a percentage of sales to the franchisor.” Rubin goes on to state that “the franchisor has almost complete control over the behavior of the franchisee” and that the “definition of the franchisee as a separate firm, rather than as part of the franchisor, is a legal and not an economic distinction.”Franchisees act as independent owners, ones that franchisors do not wholly control like employees in corporations. Currently, the contracts and its operational standards reflect this, as the franchisor essentially just sets the standards that franchisees must operate by in the product or service. For restaurants, the franchisor determines how to prepare the food so the food tastes the                                                   Timothy Bates, Analysis of Survival Rates among Franchise and Independent Small Business Start-Ups, 33 J.

For hotels, they decide how frequently rooms are cleaned, the standards for cleanliness, and even the folding of towels and bedspreads so customers know what to expect from their hotel room regardless of location. However, in the U.S. franchisors set few standards in other areas, such as Human Resource policies. This means that the franchisee may design its own policies on hiring prerequisites, or how employees get promotions. While this allows a certain degree of autonomy for the franchisee, it also begs for scrutiny of two key concepts, namely vicarious liability and the recent notion of joint employment.  In the franchising world, the theory of joint employment focuses on the view that employees can have multiple employers under the same employment relationship. It is an employment arrangement many workers have been fighting for the courts to recognize. Importantly for franchise systems, the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) issued its final rule defining join-employer status under the National Labor Relations Act (“NLRA”). This rule became effective April 27, 2020 and carried with it a more restrictive standard from the more expansive joint-employment view used in recent years. This new rule is very employer friendly, narrowing the definition of joint employer and providing a higher degree of certainty for business arrangements between companies. The new rule defines joint employer under the                                                   Marko Grünhagen et al., The Moderating Influence of HR Operational Autonomy on the Entrepreneurial Orientation-Performance Link in Franchise Systems, 10 INTREPRENEURSHIP GMT (2013)  Theodore P.

Id.  NLRA as “an employer who shares or codetermines another employer’s employees’ essential terms and conditions of employment.”However, this is a Trump administration NLRB decision that very likely will be revisited during President Joseph Biden’s tenure. Most impactful on franchising was the Browning-Ferris Industries case from 2015. In this decision, the NLRB expanded the joint-employer standard by holding that status as a join employer rested on the employer’s “reserved right to control employees as well as its indirect control over employees.” This relaxed the previous joint employment standard, potentially allowing employees to assert their right to bargain with both their direct employer as well as the company that contracted their services.There are two types of joint employment: horizontal and vertical. The Jackson Lewis firm defined horizontal joint employment as a structure “where the employee has employment relationships with two or more employers and the employers are sufficiently associated or related with respect to the employee such that they jointly employ the employee.” In contrast, vertical joint employment is defined as a structure “where the employee has an employment relationship with one employer (typically a staffing agency, subcontractor, labor contractor, or other intermediary employer) and the economic realities show that he or she is economically                                                  Id.  362 NLRB 1599 (2015).

Independent contractors are frequently put in a position where they are without protection of any workplace laws. By clarifying that the lead employer may also be responsible as a joint employer for the conditions of employment, the worker that was once without claims may have multiple avenues for relief.

This other employer, who typically contracts with the intermediary employer to receive the benefit of the employee’s labor, would be a potential joint employer.” Horizontally, such employees are sufficiently associated with both the franchisee and the franchisor. After all, the employees work at the franchisee’s location, and the uniform the employee wears has the franchisor’s logo and name on it. Vertically, the employee is economically dependent on the franchisee, as the franchisee location’s success is the source of the employee’s paycheck. The franchisee is also in a way dependent on the franchisor, for if the franchisor suffers financially or if the brand’s reputation is tarnished it may jeopardize the employee’s livelihood. If joint employment is accepted by the courts in any form, what impact would there be? With joint employment comes joint employer liability, also known as vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is when one party is held liable for the actions of a third party. This form of liability has existed since the middle ages and has had slight adjustments made to it throughout the centuries. Unfortunately, concepts that helped shape the law as it exists today were never fully updated to match modern business models leaving a great deal up to interpretation making finding vicarious liability largely incoherent. Vicarious liability has its roots in the middle ages, and “whereas modern law is founded on an action in negligence the mediaeval law was built around the forms of an action.” In the 1400s, the idea was that “an employer should be liable for an act that they had commanded,” whether it was to a serf or a servant was irrelevant. By                                                  Id.  Warren Swain, A Historical Examination of Vicarious Liability: A “Veritable Upas Tree”? 78 CAMBRIDGE J. 640 (2019). Id. Id. the late 1700s, the “principle of authority replaced that of command,” which gave room for a greater range for conduct as many servants were viewed to be part of the family and easily associated with their lords and masters. This idea is similar to how closely a franchisee’s employees are associated with the brand, and if they do any reprehensible acts, consumers and the media may easily create connotations with the whole franchise that can damage the brand’s reputation and the franchisee’s finances. Today, vicarious liability is “frequently central to the question of who pays compensation when a tort is committed. In most instances, an insurer indemnifies an employer or corporation.” Swain, writing for the Cambridge Law Journal, expanded upon the modern situation in Britain’s courts and the arguments for master’s and servant’s tort theories. He noted that while the United States might have different cases and court systems, they are intrinsically similar to the United Kingdom court system, with some changes. State and federal courts have been addressing joint employment liability over the past few years as lawsuits keep reaching higher and higher with their appeals. While the US Supreme Court has never heard a joint employment liability case, it is only a matter of time until it does and franchisors should do well to pay attention. Joint Ownership – Development and Arguments Are you an employee of the franchisor if you are an employee of the franchisee? You wear the franchisor’s logo, represent its brand, and see that its name is on your checks, but does                                                  Id. Id. Id. Id. it eliminate the authority and independence of the franchisee? And if something goes wrong, who can be held legally responsible? Franchisors frequently prioritize their brand as the most valuable asset they have and have to balance protecting their product and service standards with not exercising excessive control over franchisee operations and employee’s day-to-day actions. This difficult balance is where the lines blur, and where loopholes might come into play in litigation and liability lawsuits. Lawsuits that are filed against an individual franchisee can only be brought against the franchisor if the tort occurs where the franchisor had a hand in determining the franchise-wide policy, and in Swain’s words, an “action in negligence.” “For decades, franchisors could be held liable under a theory of vicarious liability if they exercised direct and immediate control over day-to-day employment matters.” such as how many employees are in each role and the standard of the product or service.One of the most infamous court cases against a franchise is Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants Liebeck is a milestone in US tort law and reforms of the time. Liebeck sued the franchise for requiring all units to keep the coffee well above scalding when sold to customers, as it was a health and safety risk. This was the policy because it kept the coffee tasting fresher for longer, making it possible for the company to sell the same pot for longer without having to                                                   Michael Brennan et al., Joint Liability for Franchisors: Employment, Vicarious Liability, Statutory and Other Liabilities, 14 I OF RANCHISING L. 3 (2016)  John T.

Multiple consumers had received third-degree burns from it, and Liebeck herself had her skirt melt onto her skin in her pelvic region, landing her in the hospital for over a week. The court held that the franchisor (McDonald’s) was responsible for the injuries because it was a cross-unit policy, not a rule of the one franchisee. This also meant that the plaintiff was entitled to a higher settlement for damages.  Liebeck v. McDonald’s Restaurants became well-known as a case of frivolous litigation. All to-go coffee cups are now labeled “Caution: Hot” to avoid future lawsuits against coffee-selling franchises. The media handled the case report with derision, and the general population views it as a joke. The case is the best smear campaign McDonald’s could have crafted, as now most of its customers do not think the company was in the wrong. However, Liebeck’s case is one of the very few that managed to get through the lower courts and one of the even fewer that resulted in a win for the plaintiff customer. The franchisor was responsible because McDonald's policy was to serve the coffee at the dangerously scalding temperature. Other such cases do not hold the franchisor responsible, as they usually deal with aspects of operations that are up to the individual franchisee, such as human resources. This brings us back to joint employment and vicarious liability. If franchises were to adopt and utilize joint employment, then the franchisor would have a higher risk of being sued by employees and potentially being held liable for violations committed by those entities.

The Famous McDonald’s Coffee CaseOAN  (Oct. 24, 2018), https://www.thedoanlawfirm.com/blog/2018/october/the-famous-mcdonalds-coffee-case/Currently, franchisors are at risk of joint-employer liability from their franchisees' employees.Some of the examples Lewis gives of the risk pertain to federal law violations that could come from a franchisee’s employee or the franchisee themselves.One such example is a hotel chain where one of its franchisees was being held accountable for immigration violations. The violation was committed by the franchisee’s custodial services vendor who employed undocumented workers. Many believe that it is ridiculous to expect that the franchisor could have even known any immigration violations might be occurring, as the franchise is too large to manage every little aspect. However, there may be more precedents when dealing with an employment discrimination lawsuit that violates statutes like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where there are additional clauses in the law to protect certain minorities. Joint employment status determines if an organization’s workers can have a union representation election under the National Labor Relations Act, as well as who would be held responsible in a court of law for unfair labor practices. An additional example Adler-Paindiris gives is that “a national fast-food franchisor may face exposure in a systemic disability discrimination lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) if a franchise adheres to a strict ‘100-percent healed’ policy.” Eighteen states have enacted legislation in response to ‘joint employer’ concerns, mostly by adding the distinction that a franchisee does not qualify as a franchisor’s employee, and so vertical joint                                                   Adler-Paindiris, supra note 29. Id. Id. at 4. Id.  liability cannot occur. If the United States Supreme Court ever gives a ruling on the matter, the ruling would trump whatever the states held previously per the Supremacy Clause. Child abuse, like that found in high profile child molestation cases against the Church, has raised difficult issues about the degree to which an employer should be held liable for the criminal activity of an employee. However, to pull on that string brings with it the risk of unraveling a great deal more than intended or that can be controlled in a manageable way. One of the biggest questions that comes with joint employment is, how far does it extend? And what is the correct balance between control and risk avoidance? Lewis stated that “while a wholly ‘hands-off’ strategy might be optimal for purposes of risk avoidance, it’s likely unrealistic from a business perspective.” Will joint employment liability be impacted by whether or not the franchisor actually utilizes its right to control? Technically, “the franchisor has almost complete control over the behavior of the franchise,” but they do not necessarily utilize it. There is a patchwork of different tests in determining a relationship to be a joint employer, as jurisdictions have enacted their own statutes. The first and most common analysis is the right-to-control test, which asks whether the putative employer has the right to control the means and manner in which an employee’s work is done. Factors in the analysis look at whether the purported employer has control over the hiring and firing, compensation and training, and supervision over day-to-day activities of the employee.  Alternatively, a separate                                                   Grow, supra note 41.  Swain, supra noteId.  Rubin, supra note 18.   Adler-Paindiris, supra note 29. Id. test that commonly arises in wage-hour cases is the economic realities test. This test looks at the “economic realities” of the relationship between employees and the putative joint employer to determine whether there is a joint employer relationship. Courts look to the purported employer’s ability to permit the employee to work, assessing the degree of control it has over the work conditions and method of payment. Other key factors include the amount of skill required by the employee in performing the job duties.The argument for joint employment and vicarious liability is that, if a lawsuit is filed, the plaintiff will want access to the franchisor’s deeper pockets. In addition to this, if a lawsuit is brought on grounds that could affect a multitude or even all of the different franchise units, it is not unreasonable to assume that the same issues and violations may be happening to others in the same position. Some employees believe they have a moral obligation to change the franchise standards to protect others and themselves from it happening again. This brings about the question of who should be held accountable for unjust actions.  That being said, on paper joint-employment and vicarious liability might seem reasonable. What is the degree of liability that would be practical to impose in real-world practice? As stated earlier, many believe it would be unreasonable for the franchisor to be expected to know every occurrence in its franchised units. That is why the franchisee was brought-in as an independent partner to be in charge of all management and success of the franchisee’s business. The larger a franchise gets, the harder and harder it would be for the                                                  Id. Id. Id.  Randall K.

Because of this, some plaintiffs have lawyers that argued in favor of an agency theory of liability rather than the pure joint-employment design. One case argued that the franchisor had “reserved power to impose broad discretionary control over the franchisee [which] plausibly created agency theory.”federal court refused to dismiss sexual-harassment claims against a national fast-food chain in this case. It based this argument on the fact that the employee signed the franchisor’s conduct policy, which, inter alia, established an employment relationship with the corporate franchisor.What sort of standards could be created to establish a form of joint liability that would remain fair to all parties involved? Where would the standards be crafted? What new protections will have to be put into place?  Discussion of Joint Employment Liability Today In 2014, the California Supreme Court heard Patterson v. Domino's Pizza, LLC, a case concerning employer liability for sexual harassment. Taylor Patterson was a female employee who raised allegations against her male supervisor, an assistant store manager, who, whenever  they shared the same shift, “made lewd comments and gestures [toward Patterson], and grabbed her breasts and buttocks.” After reporting the incident to the franchise owner, she had her hours                                                  Id.

She sued Domino’s based on the acts of sexual harassment as well as the franchisee’s failure to take measured actions to remedy the harassing behavior.” Claims were brought against the franchisor under the legal theory that the franchisor was the actual employer of the plaintiff and the assistant store manager or, in the alternative, that the franchisee was the agent of the franchisor, meaning that the franchisor was ultimately responsible for the actions of the male supervisor.”While the lower court ruled in Domino’s favor, the appellate court reversed. The appeals court found that these operational standards, and the comments of the Domino’s representative to Sui Juris [the franchisee] that the franchise had to get rid of the assistant manager, arguably created an agency relationship, potentially subjecting Domino’s Pizza to vicarious liability. The California Supreme Court reversed the holding of the appellate court, finding that the operational and marketing plans that are part of the franchise agreement do not create agency or employment relationships with those individuals who are hired by the franchisee.” In layman’s terms, the Californian courts believe there is reason to debate and reexamine the franchise’s relationships on all levels in a modern setting, and in theory Patterson was only one step away from having her case examined by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014. The individual contracts of that Domino’s unit determined who was responsible for training employees and the hiring and firing process as the franchisor usually does not have control over HR matters.

Now Applebee's and IHOP are the two chains with the most claims against them with four each. Many of these workers stated that they believed their claim would not be heard or hold much weight as they are viewed as expendable employees due to their lower social and financial status. One of these workers was a sixteen-year-old from the St. Louis area who worked at IHOP as part of a high school program in order to graduate. The general manager, Rami Ramadan, allegedly groped her and eventually turned to threats and demands for sex. Male and female employees at a nearby IHOP reported similar behavior from cooks at their location, and complaints were “laughed off” by the owner of both locations, Khalid Ramadan, who is brother to the general manager. Many similar accounts come from IHOP and Applebee’s locations from coast to coast from men, women, and under-age employees, but there is no response from the franchisees, and these are only those reported and filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).Forbes magazine recently identified cybersecurity and sexual harassment claims as two of the largest threats to businesses as 2018 “had sexual harassment complaints to EEOC                                                    Alexia F.

N.T. v. Taco Bell Corp. U.S. District Court Judge John W. Broomes granted Taco Bell’s motion to dismiss. The plaintiff filed claims based on sexual assault and Taco Bell's negligence. The plaintiff stated that, although the franchise knew there was a risk for sexual assault, itfailed [to] institute any policies and procedures its franchises are required to follow, which seek to prevent sexual assault in the workplace,” and that Taco Bell has “duties to provide rules regarding the operation of franchises, to ensure that the franchises are safe working environments, and to disclose the known defects and risks of operating a Taco Bell restaurant.” The judge dismissed the claim on the grounds that the plaintiff could not prove any duty the franchise had to the franchisee’s employee.

In 2019, the National Public Radio reported on a McDonald’s unit in Mason, Michigan that had over 50 women, including former employee Jenna Ries, as a part of a class-action suit against the store manager for sexual harassment, joining a multitude of cases pertaining to fast-food workers in franchises being sexually harassed and assaulted by supervisors. Despite McDonald’s issuing statements about its plans to implement new anti-harassment training, the lawsuit says, “the corporation, too, has failed to address the ‘systemic sexual harassment’ and therefore enabled it.” The company faced staged protests by its workers in May 2020, and many more women have joined in ongoing sexual harassment actions, now both in Michigan as well as a sexual harassment class action against McDonald’s on behalf of employees or former employees at more than 100 company-owned McDonald’s restaurants.What is interesting is that in November 2019, McDonald’s terminated its popular CEO, Stephen Easterbrook, with a multi-million severance package for having, reportedly, solely consensual relationship with a female employee. This was against McDonald’s current company policy, which “prohibits employees who ‘have a direct or indirect reporting relationship’ with one another from dating or having a sexual relationship.” A stereotype in                                                   Alina Selyukh, McDonald’s Sued Over ‘Systematic Sexual Harassment’ of Female EmployeesNPR (Nov. 12, 2019), https://www.npr.org/2019/11/12/778530312/mcdonalds-is-sued-over-systemic-sexual-harassment-of-female-workers.More Women Come Forward, Allege ‘Unchecked’ Sexual Harassment By Management Of Teenage Workers Employed At McDonald’s, WNYABOR ODAY (June 23, 2020), https://www.wnylabortoday.com/news/2020/06/23/new-york-city-labor-news/more-women-come-forward-allege-unchecked-sexual-harassment-by-management-of-teenage-workers-employed-at-mcdonald-s/.

McDonald’s was willing to lose its CEO to maintain its policy to protect themselves from any financial or legal repercussions, but not willing to act when the conduct of its store managers was called into question. Why are many franchises failing to address the proliferation of sexual assault claims filed against their franchisees hundreds of men, women, and even minors? Data (Graph on next page) show that the category, “Accommodation and food services,” which includes the most popular industries for franchises, has the highest number of sexual harassment charges. Finally, large franchisors, may be taking even more aggressive measures to counter the harassment.Implications In all 50 states over the years, the potential for joint employment liability to be legally recognized and reinforced in franchises had been increasing due to the over-abundance of sexual harassment claims that resulted from the #MeToo movement. For the franchise sector, this is a powder keg just waiting to explode, as the cases with every variety of circumstances keep progressing just a little bit further up the court ladder. Inevitably, many cases involve minors. Surely it is only a matter of time until a case advances to an appellate court: A case with the right plaintiff and a set of circumstances for which the franchisor can be decreed liable.

When a “correct formula” prevails, there will be a precedent for all  the other cases calling for joint employment. Joint employment’s vertical liability will be much more likely to win cases and all of the money that comes with it. No matter how expensive it may seem to fund finding a functioning solution to protect employee’s rights and, therefore, the franchise’s wallet from future legal actions, it will be incomparably more expensive to pay off all of those future claims. Franchises are already a delicate composition of control and independence that makes up a large portion of the international market and economy. Economists have no way of anticipating how far the effect joint employment might make on the industry. Also, economists do not know how far joint employment will reach if vertical liability is established before franchises have the chance to build a shield, like the way Walmart did with its no-gun policy against future shootings.  Future Research This study concludes with a summons to research. We need to know just how much of the U.S. economy is wrapped up in franchises, and how much the economy depends on the amount of revenue they generate. We also need to know, more than anything else, what could be done to prevent wrongful franchisee misbehaviour and unfair franchise control of the economy? What is a feasible solution? Are there precedents for solutions elsewhere, like Australia’s Fair Work Act with special provisions for franchises? The protesting McDonald’s franchisee employees say that the webinars and training sessions they are trying to implement are not enough to have an impact on what has been a standard of harassment. The question then is, what would be sufficient and effective? Are there existing laws in the U.S. that can be expanded, such as anti-discrimination legislation? And should legislation cut both ways, i.e. offer protection in both directions so franchisees are also protected from abuses by franchisors?                                                   Tess Hardy, Working for the Brand: The Regulation of Employment in Franchise Systems in Australia48 AUSTRALIAN . 234 (2020) Does the franchisee sign a code of conduct alongside its employees? It is a legally binding document, and slight adjustments to the wording here or there would give room for franchises to correct the source of these issues while still providing a barrier against a lawsuit. These questions are present while potential major changes in labor policy loom. Should there be a simple addition to the contract that a franchisee signs in the Human Resource section stating a zero-tolerance policy for harassment? How would they enforce that? Should there be fail-safes put in place pertaining to a situation such as the Ramadans in southern Illinois with IHOP, where one negligent franchisee owns multiple units? There is undeniably a greater threat from someone who owns multiple units to the brand and to employee safety than from someone who owns one unit, so is there a way to remove the franchisee if there are enough claims against the franchisee? Should a clause be added to the franchise agreement allowing for franchisors to terminate the franchise agreement if the franchisee is enough claims against the franchisee or if the franchisee is found liable for sexual harassment? Not to mention the question of how likely it is for sexual harassment to be the only issue in those locations in such a situation. Or, in the most radical of solutions, should franchisors establish company by company or as an industry as a whole joint employment liability themselves? Rather than wait for the Supreme Court to create the standard - declaring “open season” on franchisors and their wallets - franchisors could control the narrative and ensure more beneficial results by taking proactive action.  Which would be more practical? What would be easiest? What would be the most effective? And do any of the answers overlap? These are questions franchisors need to be asking themselves now before they lose control of the situation entirely.

Sustainability and green practices: The role of stakeholder power in fast food franchise chains Structured abstract Purpose: This paper explores how the power of salient stakeholders involved in the green waste management of franchise chains can impact the ability of the chains to change their green practices.  Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study is based on interviews data from 19 franchisors and their head office staff, operating in the fast food sector in France where franchise chains have been ‘named and shamed’ as continuing to ignore waste management regulation. Findings: Our findings suggest that both the form and bases of power of different stakeholder groups have important implications for the implementation of green practices, even those required by law. We find that the franchisees’ central network position alters the ability of franchisors to directly engage in dialog, consult with, and educate key stakeholders, creating additional challenges for franchisors in the implementation process.  Originality: Our study is the first to consider the role of stakeholders in the implementation of green practices in franchise chains. By examining franchise chains, we provide new insights into the role an additional stakeholder, that of franchisees, and enrich the literature on green practices in the hospitality sector.  Keywords Green practices, waste management, stakeholder power, franchising, fast food.Introduction The increasing concern over environmental issues means that firms are subject to ever greater scrutiny of their green practices (Baah et al., 2020). This is just not limited to industrial sectors historically associated with pollution, but also service sector organizations such as hospitality firms (Chan and Hsu, 2016). The public as well as regulators have become increasingly aware of the environmental impacts of the hospitality industry, with respect to issues such as energy use, generation of waste, and water usage (Aragon-Correa et al., 2015). Perhaps in response to the increasing scrutiny the sector is experiencing, we have seen an increase in hospitality studies exploring sustainability issues, from sustainable development approaches and implementation (Ertuna et al., 2019; Filimonau et al., 2019a; Prud’homme and Raymond, 2016), motivations for sustainable practices and environmental management engagement (Novacka et al., 2019), green marketing (Jones et al., 2014; Rivera‐Camino, 2007), and outcomes associated with greening activities (Kularatne et al., 2019; Park et al., 2017).  Despite the acknowledged importance of stakeholders in environmental strategy formation and implementation (Hart, 1995; Aykol and Leonidou, 2015), the role of stakeholders in environmental management has received less interest from hospitality researchers (Chan and Hsu, 2016). It is this key role of stakeholders which our paper seeks to explore. We do so in the context of franchise organizations, where even less is known about how stakeholders influence green practice implementation. Franchising introduces additional stakeholders, most notably franchisees, as well as employees of franchisees, local communities, and the local governments where franchisees operate their units (Kim and Lee, 2020). Franchise chains, therefore, may be subject to potentially different types and intensity of stakeholder responses and pressures compared with other types of organization. Whilst franchisees, as residual agents, may be believed to have interests more closely aligned with their franchisor compared with employee managers (Combs et al., 2009), which could potentially facilitate green practice implementation (Hörisch et al., 2014), such alignment cannot be assumed, as franchisees may be primarily concerned with the short term profitability of their own units, rather than the longer term sustainability of the chain (Barthélemy, 2011). Furthermore, the pivotal position franchisees hold within the network, given their interactions with employees, customers and other stakeholders, means that the franchisor may find it more challenging to manage their relationship with other stakeholders who are instrumental in greening activities. The aim of our paper is, therefore, to explore how key stakeholders can impact the ability of franchisors to implement green practices in their chain restaurants. The empirical study deals with the specific green practice of waste management within the context of the French market. Waste management is of considerable importance in the fast food sector, with an estimated 1 kg of waste produced daily by an average consumer of hospitality services within Europe (Bohdanowicz, 2006).  It is also subject to regulation within Europe. We focus on fast food franchise chains operating in France given the French government’s recent ‘naming and shaming’ of major fast food chains, who three years after its introduction, were still not in compliance with a governmental decree obliging companies that generate more than 1,100 litres of waste per week to sort and recycle it according to five streams (‘Tri 5 Flux’): paper, plastic, metal, glass, and wood, and to separate biodegradable waste from all other waste (ADEME, 2017). In early 2019, the French Secretary of State for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition (Brune Poirson) summoned the executives of all the major fast food chains operating in France to discuss their waste management, asserting that there had been “…zero effort in terms of sorting non-food waste”. Following this meeting, the government introduced a three-year compliance plan for fast-food chains, where at least 70% of restaurants must be compliant by 31 December 2019, 90% by 31 December 2020, and 100% by 31 December 2021 (Gouvernement, 2020). Thus, the French market is a particularly interesting context in which to explore waste management practices and regulation effects within franchise chains.  From the French experience, it would seem that despite regulatory obligations, fast food franchise chains have been either unwilling or unable to change their waste management practices, which leads us to question why this might be the case. What role do different                                                             Separation of biodegradable waste is only required for those companies which produce more than 10 tons of biodegradable waste, or more than 60 liters of edible oil waste per year. https://www.leparisien.fr/societe/tri-des-dechets-les-fast-foods-rappeles-a-l-ordre-31-01-2019-8000793.php  There are no available statistics as to whether fast food companies have met this requirement, although a study by ‘#ZerodéchetauMcDo’ (Zero Waste McDonalds) found that just 36% of McDonald’s outlets had sorting facilities in their restaurants (https://www.actu-environnement.com/ae/news/restauration-rapide-tri-dechets-salle-peu-progres-34906.php4). stakeholders play in enabling/inhibiting the implementation of green waste management practices? To address these questions, we undertook a qualitative study comprising 19 interviews with franchisors and their head office staff operating in the fast food sector in France. As stakeholder theory puts “people at the centre of the story” (Freeman et al.2020, p. 224), a qualitative approach was believed most appropriate as it enables the researcher to gather richer data that is grounded in the real-life experiences of people (Altinay et al., 2013). We focus on franchisor perspectives given they represent the focal organization who are ultimately responsible for the implementation of waste management practices and answerable to government. It is their perception of the situation that drives their behaviors and responses in relation to their stakeholders and implementation activities. Our findings suggest that the achievement of green waste management depends on the commitment of various stakeholders: local government, suppliers, franchisees, franchisee employees, and customers. Franchisees through their network position have a critical role. We find both the source of power and forms of power vary between different stakeholder groups, with the government primarily relying on coercive authority to compel franchisors to improve their waste management, whilst other stakeholders, through their competence and legitimate authority are able to inhibit, or at least slow implementation due to their position within the network.  Our research makes several contributions. Firstly, we enrich the stream of literature on green practices in franchise organizations. Research which has considered green management practices within franchise chains is limited, despite their important economic contribution particularly within the hospitality sector (Combs et al., 2004; Preble et al., 2000). There are some studies of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities in franchise chains (Choi and Lee, 2018; Jell-Ojobor, 2019, Meiseberg and Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015) but these have tended to focus on outcomes, rather than process. For example, both Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012) and Jell-Ojobor (2019) investigated how CSR activities impact performance outcomes, whilst Perrigot et al.(2015) explored the impact of franchise chain size and proportion of franchised units on CSR reporting on franchisor websites. Interestingly, both Meiseberg and Ehrmann (2012) and Perrigot et al. (2015) found that CSR activities/disclosures diminished as the proportion of franchised outlets rises. Similarly, Choi and Lee (2018) in their study of the relationship between financial performance and corporate social performance found that although a positive relationship between financial performance and corporate social performance was present, this positive relationship dwindled the greater the proportion of franchised units. Whilst it is possible to infer from these findings that the additional stakeholders associated with franchise chains (most notably franchisees) inhibit the franchisor’s ability (or desire) to implement sustainable practices, if/how this occurs has yet to be explored. Secondly, we contribute to stakeholder identification and salience theory by focusing on its most influential attribute, that of power (Mitchell et al., 1997; Parent and Deephouse, 2007) and how it might influence implementation of green practices. Whilst prior literature has explored how stakeholders may contribute to green strategy development (Lyon et al., 2017; Polonsky, 1995; Rivera‐Camino, 2007), how stakeholder power affects implementation has received less attention (Bondy, 2008), especially where the green practices being adopted have largely been imposed upon the sector through regulation rather than voluntary initiatives. Further, as identified by Kim et al. (2017) the role of different stakeholders in implementing green practices in the hospitality sector is under researched. Given the increasing scrutiny hospitality firms are under in relation to their environmental performance, this is an important area of study. Finally, our research also contributes to practice and policy. The study can help franchisors to better assess the multiplicity and respective powers of stakeholders required to achieve better waste management. For government, it can enable understanding of how to involve other stakeholders to ensure effective environmental legislation.  Stakeholder Theory Stakeholder theory is one of the key approaches used in social, environmental and sustainability management research (Hörisch et al., 2014). Whilst stakeholder theory proposes that a firm may be affected by, or conversely affect stakeholders, the majority of studies drawing on stakeholder theory have focused on how pressure from various stakeholder groups may motivate organizations to engage in green activities (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Perez-Batres et al., 2012; Sulkowski et al., 2018). This perhaps reflects an interpretation of sustainability management more aligned with CSR, given these two concepts are often referred to interchangeably (Bansal and Song, 2017). Sustainability management is defined as “the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of both environmental and socioeconomic sustainability-related decisions and actions” (Starik and Kanashiro, 2013, p. 12) whilst CSR explicitly refers to the firm’s consideration of, and response to, social responsibility beyond that required by law (Montiel, 2008). The voluntariness explicit in CSR has provoked an interest in why some firms are more proactive in their search for solutions to social and environmental problems than others, and the influence of stakeholders in this.  Our focus is thus somewhat different, given we consider the case of a sustainability practice required by law. We seek to understand how stakeholder relationships impact organizational responses to the regulation, focusing on the relative power of different stakeholders and the extent to which this impacts their cooperation and therefore the organization’s ability (and willingness) to comply. Stakeholders are “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization’s objectives” (Freeman, 1984, p. 46), and therefore are not homogenous in their values, objectives, or influence (Polonsky, 1995). It is therefore important to understand how managers determine which stakeholders are salient.  Mitchell et al. (1997, p. 854) propose that stakeholder salience can be determined by their “possession of one, two, or all three of the following attributes: (1) the stakeholder’s power to influence the firm, (2) the legitimacy of the stakeholder’s relationship with the firm, and (3) the urgency of the stakeholder’s claim on the firm”. Of these three attributes, our focus in this paper is on how stakeholder power influences waste management strategy implementation. We do so for several reasons. Firstly, organizations are assumed to manage their stakeholder relationships with an emphasis on stakeholder power (Rasi et al., 2014), and this attribute has been deemed to be the most influential by various authors (Mitchell et al., 1997; Parent and Deephouse, 2007). Secondly, urgency of claims by different stakeholders can be presumed here, given that fast food chains have been subject to waste management regulation for almost five years, and are now under considerable pressure to comply. Thirdly, we do not attempt to consider how all stakeholders may influence waste management implementation, but rather explore how those stakeholders identified by franchise chains as being influential have played a role in the implementation of waste management practices. We thus presume franchisors will only identify those stakeholders whom they consider to be legitimate.  Whilst power has several definitions (Mitchell et al., 1997), it is socially constituted and can broadly be defined in terms of influence (French and Raven, 1959). It is the “relationship among social actors in which one social actor, A, can get another social actor, B, to do something that B would not otherwise have done” (Pfeffer, 1981, p. 3). Stakeholders have varying degrees of power to influence other stakeholders to act in a way that they otherwise would not, or indeed to prevent them from acting in a way which they would otherwise wish to do. The extent to which a stakeholder holds power has been explained in reference to two key sources of power: (1) the resources that a stakeholder possesses that are critical to the focal organization (Pfeffer, 1992), that is resource dependency; and (2) their network position (Rowley, 1997).   Resource dependency theory explores how the possession of tangible (e.g., money or infrastructure) or intangible (e.g., knowledge or skills) critical resources can provide stakeholders with power if they are able to regulate or control access, possession, allocation and use of such resources (Tiew et al., 2015). Whilst resource dependency focuses on the nature of the resource relationship, the network perspective of power suggests that the position of the stakeholder (with respect to other stakeholders and the focal organization) also has implications for the power a stakeholder possesses (Pajunen, 2006). Thus, network power “refers to power obtained through the network’s structure, as opposed to power gained through individual attributes” (Rowley, 1997, p. 898). Although network centrality (or power) is determined from three components (Freeman, 1979; Rowley, 1997): degree (number of direct links to other network members), closeness (independent access to others) and betweenness (the position of a stakeholder positioned between other stakeholders), we focus on betweenness centrality, given it is the most appropriate component for measuring the ability to control resources and information across a network (Pajunen, 2006). Several studies have suggested that to fully understand the power position of a stakeholder, using a dual approach by considering both resource dependency and network centrality, is appropriate to best understand a stakeholder influence within a network (Hazra et al., 2017; Pajunen, 2006; Tiew et al.2015). Thus, in order to explore the influence of different stakeholder groups on the implementation of green practices, we consider both resource and network-based sources of power. In addition to considering source of power, there have been several categorizations of forms of power (e.g., Etzioni, 1961; Raven and French, 1958). We draw on the typology developed by Wrong (1979) as this is the most common in tourism and hospitality contexts (see e.g., Beritelli and Laesser, 2011; Marzano and Scott, 2009; Saito and Ruhanen, 2017). Wrong (1979) suggests that power can be conceptualized in four ways: force, manipulation, persuasion and authority. Force refers to “the creation of physical obstacles restricting the freedom of another” (Wrong, 1979, p. 24). Manipulation refers to “acts of negotiation that involve a measure of distortion, deception or exploitation” (Few, 2002, p. 35). Persuasion is similar to manipulation, but lacks negative connotations (Marzano and Scott, 2009), and includes advertising rhetoric (Wrong, 1979). Authority is defined as the “institutional code within which the use of power is organized and legitimized” (Parsons, 1963, p. 243). Authority is a particularly apposite form of power as it is deemed the relevant mechanism for “exercising intended influence in an inter-institutional context” (Beritelli and Laesser, 2011, p. 1300).  Authority has been further conceptualized as comprising four components – coercive, induced, legitimate and competent authority. Coercive authority refers to the extent to which an agent is believed to have authority to punish another stakeholder if they fail to conform to the influence attempt (French and Raven, 1959). Induced authority can be seen as the opposite of coercion, and involves one stakeholder’s use of material rewards to entice another stakeholder to comply (Wrong, 1979). Under legitimate authority, “the power holder possesses an acknowledged right to command and the power subject and acknowledged obligation to obey” (Wrong, 1979, p. 49), and is associated with a feeling of ‘oughtness’ (French and Raven, 2001). Competence authority is exerted when one stakeholder uses their expertise to influence other actors (Saito and Ruhanen, 2017). In examining the influence of different stakeholder groups on the implementation of green waste management practices, we consider the role of both the source (bases) and form of power that different stakeholder groups possess on the implementation process. We thus extend previous studies, which focus on either source (Hein et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018) or form (Harness et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2019; Roome and Wijen, 2006). Furthermore, there is little research which considers how organizations respond to regulations which require a change in green practices. Perhaps there is an assumption that organizations will comply. The recent case in France, however, suggests that franchise chains are either unwilling or unable to comply. In either case, this might mean that fast food franchise chains believe their salient stakeholders do not have the power or inclination to punish them for non-compliance, or the stakeholders are using their power to inhibit the franchisors’ ability to implement the necessary changes. This becomes even more complex as franchising leads to the creation of further groups of stakeholders, as emphasized by Kim and Lee (2020). Methodology Our research was guided by a constructivism paradigm where reality is socially constructed, and thus context is deemed to have an important role in theory development (Bogna et al., 2020). A qualitative approach was adopted, based on in-depth interviews with fast food chain franchisors and their head office staff operating in France. Qualitative approaches are increasingly being used in franchising studies (e.g., Doherty, 2009; Watson et al., 2020) and studies of green practices (Bondy, 2008; Lin et al., 2019; Roome and Wijen, 2006). A qualitative research method was believed to be the most appropriate, as it enables data to be gathered that is grounded in the real-life experiences of people (Altinay et al., 2013). The subjective nature of qualitative research methods “allows researchers to better understand and interpret the depth of responses and respondents’ opinions about creating and maintaining their social realities” (Grünhagen et al., 2020, p. 6). In this regard, we limited our sample to franchisors, given it is they who are ultimately responsible for compliance with green waste regulation, and therefore it is their social reality which is our concern. Their perceptions may not reflect an objective reality, but it is what drives their actions. Thus, a qualitative research approach enables us to build an in-depth understanding of how and why organizational members view an issue as they do, and the ways they behave as a result (Walsh, 2003). France was chosen as a particularly relevant context for several reasons. Firstly, the government’s public ‘naming and shaming’ of fast food chains who have not complied with waste sorting regulation highlights that regulation alone does not necessarily create change in environmental practice. This provided an opportunity to explore why this might be the case, and the potential influence of different stakeholder groups. Secondly, France is one of the leading markets for franchising in the world, with 1,927 franchisors, 78,032 franchised units, sales of 63.88 billion euros and 668,837 direct and indirect jobs (French Franchise Federation, 2021). Thirdly, franchising is particularly developed in the fast food sector both internationally, but also within France, with 208 domestic and foreign (mainly US) chains operating within France, represented by 6,658 franchised restaurant outlets and revenues of 5.42 billion euros (French Franchise Federation, 2021). Data CollectionOur sample of 19 franchisors and their head office staff (representing 17 different chains) were selected through a combination of purposive and snowball sampling, an approach often used in qualitative franchise studies (Doherty, 2009; Watson et al., 2020). Respondents were selected based on their position within the network affording them insights into the implementation of waste management practices, and the role of different stakeholder groups. Recruitment of participants ceased when no new themes were emerging from the data collected – i.e., when data saturation was achieved. Boddy (2016) suggests that saturation is typically achieved by 12 interviews, and that samples over 30 are likely to be too unwieldly to analyse. Our sample size is of similar magnitude to other hospitality studies (e.g., Filimonau et al., 2019b, Crawford, 2013) and stakeholder research (e.g., Tiew et al., 2015, Lin et al., 2018). The respondents, on average, had been in post for 5 years (tenure ranged from 1-16 years). The sample included representatives from chains of various sizes, and fast-food sectors (cuisines). The interviews were semi-structured in nature and began by asking the respondents about their current waste management practices, and how their chain has responded to the five-stream sorting mandated by the French government. We then asked questions designed to explore the role of both internal as well as external stakeholders in the waste management process, and the impact of green waste management practices on their business. Table 1 provides the interview guide. Most interviews were conducted by phone for reasons of geographical distance, and all were audio-recorded. The interviews were conducted in French and then transcribed. The total length of the interviews was 14 hours 34 minutes, for an average of 48 minutes. Details of the participants are provided in Table 2. <<Insert Tables 1 and 2>> Data Analysis To interpret the data, we used an abductive analytical approach, such that the analytical process moved back and forth between theory and data (Hahn and Ince, 2016). We analysed the data in three key stages, using an approach recommended by Corley and Gioia (2004). In the first stage, an open coding approach was used, where initial concepts were identified, and grouped into categories using descriptive coding, under the broad themes of the interview questions. We focused on identifying the stakeholder involved, the nature of their involvement, and their influence. The data was initially analyzed in French, before being translated, and the codes reviewed by a second coder. In the second stage (axial coding), we searched for relationships between and among these categories, to create higher order themes, navigating between the data-driven codes and the theory (Timmermans and Tavory, 2012). This stage was conducted by the first coder in French, and then reviewed using the translated text by a second coder (after back translation checks). The creation of a dataset in both languages (French and English) increased reliability and construct validity (Altinay et al., 2013). In the final stage (dimensional coding), the themes were gathered into overarching dimensions. Table 3 provides some examples of this process. This three stage approach was undertaken to enhance internal validity (Altinay et al., 2013). Furthermore, by having one author code in the native language, with checks made by the second coder from the translated data, it meant that where disagreements existed, translation issues could be easily identified and validity enhanced. The examination of data by two coders also helped alleviate inductive bias (Miles and Huberman, 1994). Test for interrater reliability found Cohen’s Kappa at 0.8, indicating substantial agreement between coders (McHugh, 2012). Where disagreements existed, inconsistencies were resolved by discussion between the two coders.  <<Insert Table 3>> Findings External Stakeholders National Government The prime source of the government’s power comes from its resource power, and its degree of centrality (number of links to other stakeholders). Whilst the government does not necessarily possess resources required by franchise chains, it does possess the capacity to remove critical resource (through fines) from franchise chains who do not comply with its regulatory requirements. The government can use coercive authority to ensure that organizations act in the manner they wish. However, whilst the introduction of the law in 2016 for waste sorting suggests the use of coercive authority, the absence of sanctions on those chains who are not compliant, suggests the French government is reluctant to wield this form of power. It was not until 2019 that the fast food operators were confronted, and despite a lack of compliance for three years, chains have been granted further time to introduce appropriate waste management practices before they will be penalized. It would seem, however, that the threat of the use of coercive authority has sharpened the focus of franchisors who now see this as an imperative.  The French government has also used its position in the network to exert pressure on the franchisor through other stakeholder groups, most notably consumers by publicising the shortcomings of major fast food chains in national media, even naming the non-compliant chains. One franchisor commented: “…I think she's [Brune Poirson] putting pressure on us, not necessarily with sanctions but rather with the media in fact” (#10). This ‘naming and shaming’ of franchise chains within the media is a form of persuasive power.  Local Government Whilst the national government has imposed requirements for fast food chains to introduce green waste management practices, our findings suggest that local government also has the power to help ensure fast food chains implement better practices. Local government’s key source of power relates to the infrastructure resources and facilities they possess for waste collection and disposal. Whilst some local municipalities have invested heavily in waste collection services, in others the provision is seen by franchisors as substantially lacking. In particular, frequency of collection over busy periods like weekends means that outlets face difficulty in storing waste. For example: “[City name] has commissioned a truck that goes from Tuesday to Friday. They stay there for half an hour, and we have to put out all the rubbish and all the boxes. The problem is that we're open 7 days a week, every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, which are our busiest days, which makes it a bit complicated because we end up with all our waste” (#17). The amount of sorting supported also varies, with some municipalities supporting five stream sorting, and others only offering two or three stream sorting. Some respondents explained that sorting at their restaurant was futile, as everything is placed in a single bin by the municipal collection services. A franchisor said: “…we can sort it out on our side, and at the end, they take all the bags, they put them in the same bin…there's no logic at all. What's the point?” (#4). This perception of variability in local authority commitment to waste management is supported by statistics, with recycling rates of solid waste varying between 28% and 55% across different regions of France (European Environment Agency, 2016), perhaps reflecting differences in budget allocation for waste management, as well as differences in how national policies have been applied. Local authorities can thus be seen as possessing inducement authority with respect to the franchise chains – the provision of waste collection and disposal services by local authorities facilitates the adoption of green waste management practices by franchise chains. In some cases, local authorities also use coercive authority to help promote sorting practices by imposing fines on restaurants which do not comply with local regulations. Customers The customers of the fast food chains were found to be powerful stakeholders. The customers’ source of power comes from the resources they possess: financial and human capital. Customers have the power to withdraw their custom from chains who do not meet their expectations of appropriate waste management practice (coercive power). Thus, for some chains, customers were a strong driving force behind decisions to change waste management practices, due to their increasing green expectations. As one franchisor commented: “I think it's the consumer behavior that impacts businesses […] I think it's not necessarily because a restaurant is going to start sorting that customers are going to start sorting. I think it's because consumers are going to start wanting to sort that restaurants in general are going to do the same...” (#18).Even in the context of government regulation and potential sanctions, it is the economic power of the customers that appears to motivate changes in practice. However, several systems are not convinced that the environmental performance of the chain is important to consumers patronage decisions. A franchisor remarked: “I don't know if we gain customers because we recycle. I don't know if we can lose customers because we don't recycle… it's true that it's possible, but I don't know…” (#19).  For those systems which are wishing to change their practices in order to comply with government regulation, consumers were felt to be an impediment to compliance. Consumers hold an important resource – human capital – that franchise chains are dependent upon for the successful implementation of waste sorting. As one franchisor commented: “…they put everything in the same bin. That's what's quite surprising because today's consumers are extremely demanding when it comes to brands in terms of their environmental commitments. But in their consumption habits, they don't sort waste. A few do, but the vast majority, over 90%, do not do so…” (#3). The lack of cooperation of customers was certainly felt to inhibit the chains ability to comply with regulation. One franchisor said: “We want to do well, we want it to work, we want to sort but it's not necessarily the case for the customer […] It's not a question of putting a trash in the garbage and saying that is ‘sorting’! That's not how it works…” (#10). Franchisors seem to lack legitimate authority over their customers, and therefore simply obliging consumers to participate in sorting of their waste within the restaurant, is not sufficient to induce the desired behavior. Whilst some chains feel that consumers have little concern about environmental issues, and impede their ability to comply with regulations, other chains believe consumers are concerned with the brand environmental performance. Unsurprisingly, those chains who feel their consumers are influenced by environmental factors are the most proactive in improving their waste management practices.  Suppliers Our findings showed that suppliers have the power to facilitate or inhibit the implementation of green waste practices in fast food restaurants. Primarily this is because some suppliers have valuable resources in the form of knowledge and facilities which can be used to help improve waste management. Suppliers were able to assist franchisors in the implementation of green waste practices in several ways. Firstly, many franchisors were able to work with their suppliers in the development of more ecological materials (e.g., organic cutlery, or recyclable packaging). Suppliers seem to be more advanced than the franchise chains in the development of more ecological materials, making suggestions to the chains as to how they can improve their practices. One franchisor said “We work with [Name of the supplier] who provides us with … all of our packaging […] They're the ones who first suggested we use paper straws” (#5).   Secondly, suppliers play an important role in waste recovery. A franchisor explained: “… Our logistics provider comes each week to deliver one to four pallets of dry or cold products. …When they make the delivery, they take the cardboard boxes and plastic waste which we generated during the week; and then we enter into a much more virtuous circle, a much better win-win situation” (#3).  Many franchise chains have developed partnerships to reduce and recover waste. Some chains work with a social enterprise to recover their food waste, with unsold items sold at a lower price through an online platform. Other partnerships concern organic waste, coffee grounds, oils. For example, one franchisor said: “We have a partner who retrieves all our organic waste to make fertilizers for agriculture around Paris. […] We also have [another partner] […] and in fact it's a company that grows mushrooms and retrieves our coffee grounds […] They reclaim our coffee grounds to make fertilizers for their mushrooms. So in fact it revalorizes our waste […] 90% of our organic waste is coffee, so it's huge!” (#18). As new and existing suppliers have developed ecological initiatives to help improve waste practices, this has persuaded franchisors to adopt better practices. In this regard, suppliers use authority power, in the form of competence (expert) authority to influence franchise chains’ waste practices. Many suppliers seem to have reacted to the changes mandated by government more rapidly, developing new materials to protect their business in the long run, and identifying new market opportunities in offering waste solutions.   Whilst generally suppliers seemed to be enabling franchise fast food chains to develop greener waste management practices and comply with regulation, a few franchisors had experienced difficulties with their suppliers. As one franchisor explained: “We have a lot of trouble because our suppliers give us wooden crates for the vegetables, and we can't put the wood in any garbage cans” (#17). However, franchisors have the power to delist suppliers (coercive authority) who do not offer packaging or materials that meet their requirements. Overall we find that suppliers, through their competence authority, have created improvements in the waste management practices of the fast food sector. Internal Stakeholders Franchisees According to the literature, both internal and external stakeholders play a role in the development and implementation of green practices (Lin et al., 2019). For franchise systems, they have an additional, and potentially powerful stakeholder - their franchisees. Whilst a franchisor is usually considered the more powerful partner in the franchisor-franchisee relationship, we found that franchisees are not without power when it comes to the successful implementation of waste management practices. Similar to consumers, franchisees’ power is derived from both their resources (particularly human capital) and network position (proximity to final consumer).  For many chains, franchisees are required to follow the waste management practices stipulated by the franchisor (in the same way they are required to follow all operational processes stipulated by the franchisor). Although the franchisor has the potential to use legitimate or coercive authority to influence franchisee behavior, the extent to which franchisees adhere to, or are required to adhere to, franchisor instructions with respect to waste practices varies. One franchisor commented that franchisees are given a certain amount of latitude, stating that: “…the franchisees are independent, so we strongly advise them but we can't force them, so they are free. Now, in our own stores [company-owned stores], we don't leave them any choice” (#11). For other systems, waste practices are mandated, and checks are made to ensure compliance. As one franchisor stated: “The franchisees are bound by the franchise contract […]. It will become an obligation […] and there will be repercussions if they don’t” (#14). Of course, whilst franchisors can make checks that franchisees are following instructions, and potentially impose sanctions if they do not (use coercive authority), ultimately franchisees have considerable operational power with respect to sorting. The franchisees network position affords them power to impede the franchisor’s ability to comply with the regulations.  The variability of local municipalities in the provision of services they offered, also creates additional challenges for franchisors to establish chain-wide sorting practices that can be mandated, as they have to tailor the processes for franchisees located in different territories. For other aspects of waste management, such as the use of packaging materials, franchisors have greater sway (coercive authority), given they control the supplies. As one franchisor commented: “they [franchisees] are dependent on the packaging we offer as they are not able to buy packaging anywhere else” (#13).In this regard, the resources of the franchisor can be used to afford coercive authority over their franchisees. Although, the franchisor-franchisee relationship is usually characterized as one where the franchisor has greater power, it is not subject to the same types of hierarchical controls typical in employer-employee relationships (Combs et al., 2004), and this means that some franchisors do not feel they have the power to introduce changes without consultation, or at least are more reluctant to introduce changes without considering the potential impacts on franchisees. In such cases, franchisees themselves have some legitimate authority, primarily obtained from their position within the network. As one franchisor commented: “…negotiation is important.” (#13). Several franchisors stressed how they had to explain the need for change to their franchisees, for example: “…our approach is to try to explain on the one hand that in terms of brand image for a network, continuing to make 100% plastic … is in the long run quite suicidal. What we are advocating to them is that integrating an environmental approach to packaging is a question of survival for restaurant groups.” (#13).In this regard, franchisors use competence authority to influence their franchisees’ behavior. Such an approach may be preferred over coercive methods to ensure maintenance of good franchisee-franchisor relationships. Whilst the need to consult with franchisees about proposed changes does potentially slow some franchisors implementation of green waste management practices, for other systems, franchisees were driving the changes, encouraging the franchisor to adopt greener practices, and proposing potential initiatives or solutions. As one franchisor explained: “sometimes there are franchisees who have good ideas, good practices and we will take this information to the company-owned stores, and listen to the franchisees” (#14). In this regard, it was the legitimate authority of the franchisees which led to changes in waste management practices. Franchisees’ key source of power is their betweenness with respect to different stakeholder groups; their position in the network means they, unlike the franchisor, have direct interactions with both employees and customers. Several franchisors commented on their reliance on franchisees to train and motivate employees appropriately, as well as educate consumers. Of course, this means that franchisors are relying on franchisees to be motivated and provide their human capital to support effective implementation of green waste management practices. A franchisor said: “… they have to be motivated on their own because otherwise a manager who is not motivated can't pass on the motivation of sorting to his/her teams and show them that it's not that complicated” (#18). Motivation withstanding, some franchisors felt that because they are reliant on franchisees to convey information to employees, that employee training will not be as effective. As a franchisor stated: “We're going to teach the franchisee who will then teach the employee and the manager. So, at the end of the day, there is always a loss of information…” (#5).  In addition to their legitimate authority over employee behavior, franchisees were also seen to be in a position of power when it came to educating consumers. As a franchisor commented “…it's up to them [each franchisee] to put in place, at least at the customer level, a member of staff who can explain to customers how to sort, which bin to put it in and how to do that for sure” (#6). Thus, franchisees have persuasive power with respect to consumers, afforded to them by their network position. Restaurant Employees Just as franchisees have power as a result of their position in the network, employees too have power afforded to them because of their betweenness and can use coercive power to withhold their human capital that is required to implement green waste management practices as set out by the franchisor. Whilst employees are generally believed to follow procedures, some franchisors mentioned that this is not always the case. Franchisors are reliant on franchisees to train and enforce appropriate behaviors among their employees, and thus franchisors have no direct legitimate or coercive authority over employees in franchised outlets. Further evidence of the power afforded to employees, through their network position, was found in the relationship with the chain’s customers. Since employees are the ones who directly interact with consumers, it provides them with persuasive power in their relations with consumers. As one franchisor commented: “…they [employees] have an educational role vis-à-vis the customers. Today as a small business and a restaurant, you are the leader of your customers, it is up to you to demonstrate that the implementation of sorting is important. So, we are going to ask you to be an educator…” (#1). However, because it is the franchisees who are responsible for managing employees, ultimately the franchisor has only an indirect relationship with employees, which leaves them with little ability to control their behaviors with respect to this important informational role. In other words, the franchisor lacks coercive or legitimate authority with respect to employees in franchise outlets. Although employees do appear to have power to influence the implementation of green waste practices, they did not appear to have power to influence the development of the waste management strategy. The power employees hold with respect to implementation, comes from the relationship with the customer, rather than their interactions with the franchisor. Discussion Whilst the important role stakeholders play in the development of green strategies has been highlighted by several studies (Baah et al., 2020; Harness et al., 2018; Lin et al.2018; Prud’homme and Raymond, 2016; Theodoulidis et al., 2017), little attention has been given to how stakeholders influence the implementation of environmental practices mandated by government through regulation. Although it might be expected that regulatory powers bestow governments with the greater power compared with other stakeholders, our findings suggest that the presence of regulation is not in itself sufficient to induce change without the co-operation of several stakeholders.We find that for franchise chains, the stakeholder with the greatest power is the franchisee. Indeed, their network position – their betweenness – provides them with substantive persuasive power, and coercive and legitimate authority in relation to employees and customers. Their network position also fundamentally alters the ability of franchisors to directly engage in dialog, consult with, and educate these two key stakeholders. Thus, whilst franchisors can potentially mandate franchisees to comply with the operational processes they develop, they are reliant on their franchisees’ motivation and co-operation in engaging other stakeholders, most notably the customer, to ensure a mutuality of sustainability interests and knowledge and skills development. For example, customers, must follow waste sorting instructions, and thus, franchisees and their employees have an important role to play in educating them (ensuring customers have the knowledge of how to sort) and convincing them of the benefits of co-operation (mutuality of interests). Thus, for implementation to be successful, franchisees are required to do more than simply follow processes mandated by franchisors but be proactive in their engagement with those stakeholders with whom they have regular interactions. In this respect, franchisors cannot rely on coercive authority to force franchisees to cooperate – such an approach is only likely to have sway in relation to operational aspects. Rather they should use persuasion, competence and legitimate authority, in order to motivate franchisees, and convince them of the potential benefits of improved environmental practices for their business.  As with other types of organization, consumers were found to be a highly influential stakeholder group. Many franchisors do not believe that the environmental performance of fast food chains is important in most consumers’ decision-making. In the absence of consumers using their persuasive power or coercive authority to influence franchisors (or indeed franchisees) to improve their waste management practices, many franchisors do not view compliance with regulations as an urgent issue. The franchisor’s detachment from their customers means they are heavily reliant on their franchisees for customer insights and engagement, given it is they who sit at the coalface of customer centric activities (Watson et al., 2020), making it more challenging for franchisors to understand how to approach and implement sustainable practices. Whilst most franchisors believe that the majority of consumers are not significantly motivated by environmental issues, of course for some consumers this a concern. Chains that target environmentally concerned consumers were found to be (or at least claimed to be) compliant with the regulations. This highlights the important role of consumers in changing organizational practices.  Our findings thus show that the possession of various forms and bases of power by different stakeholder groups has important implications for the implementation of green management practices, even those required by law. Figure 1 illustrates the network of inter-stakeholder power relationships and the central position of franchisees. It highlights how the existence of different bases and forms of power create a complex web of often opposing forces. Whilst franchisors have coercive power over their franchisees, franchisees have substantive legitimate and competence authority (due to their local market knowledge) over their franchisors. Franchisees have persuasive power over their customers; yet customers have coercive authority as they may boycott restaurants, and can refuse to co-operate with waste sorting.  This intertwining of power, along with the reciprocity, make the implementation of green practices within franchised fast food chains, even those that are regulated, highly challenging. <<Insert Figure 1>> Contributions to the Literature Our research contributes to the literature on green practices and franchising in several ways. Firstly, we enrich the stream of literature on green practices in the tourism and hospitality sector (Kim et al., 2017) by examining the question of stakeholder power in the specific case of the restaurant sector that has been neglected in the literature compared to the hotel sector (Chan and Hsu, 2016). Moreover, the number of studies which include franchise organizations in exploring green practices is scant (Kim and Lee, 2020). Secondly, whilst within the franchising literature, a few studies have explored CSR (Choi and Lee, 2018; Jell-Ojobor, 2019; Meiseberg and Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015), these have not focused on environmental practices in particular, nor the role of different stakeholder groups in their implementation. The presence of franchisees can slow implementation, as franchisors must persuade franchisees of the potential benefits to their business of any changes in practice in order to maintain positive franchisee-franchisor relationships, and ensure their co-operation in educating and training employees and customers in new green practices.  Thirdly, we contribute to stakeholder theory by focusing on how stakeholder power contributes to the implementation of green practices. Our study is one of the first studies to consider how organizations respond to regulatory changes, unlike the extant literature where the focus has been on voluntary actions.This study therefore broadens and deepens our understanding of the role of different stakeholders in ensuring that regulations are effective in changing organizational practice. Moreover, whilst power has long been recognized as determining the salience of different stakeholders to environmental strategy development (Harvey and Schaefer, 2001; Rivera-Camino, 2007), its role in the implementation phase is less researched. However, as Lin et al. (2017, p. 319) comment, “understanding the distribution of stakeholder power is important for the clarification of different roles and responsibilities on implementing social responsibility”. We consider both the bases and form of power that different stakeholders possess, extending previous studies which have focused on either the source (Hazra et al., 2017; Pajunen, 2006; Tiew et al., 2015) or form (Beritelli and Laesser, 2011; Marzano and Scott, 2009; Saito and Ruhanen, 2017) of power. Contributions to Practice Our research also contributes to practice and policy. For franchisors, our findings may help them to better understand the role of different stakeholders in achieving improved green practices. Given the powerful role of franchisees in ensuring successful implementation, franchisors should consider carefully how they communicate changes within the system to ensure that franchisees not only adopt the necessary processes, but are motivated to promote these changes to their employees and consumers, and recruit employees who are environmentally sensitive. Using coercive power alone over franchisees is unlikely to be successful – rather they have to use their legitimate and competence authority to persuade franchisees of the benefits of their involvement. Franchisors can codify their know-how on waste management practices in their operational manuals, and transfer this set of know-how to their franchisees through initial and continuous training sessions, including webinars on their Intranet system for franchisees’ employees as well. Knowledge-sharing structures which encourage social exchanges (such as Franchisee Advisory Councils) and regional and national meetings could be used to promote social capital (Watson et al., 2020), given its importance in mobilizing stakeholder engagement in sustainability activities (Maak, 2007). For governments, we highlight that without co-operation of several stakeholder groups, their coercive power may not be sufficient to ensure effective regulation. Regulators need to consider how different stakeholder groups will respond to any proposed changes, and how other forms of power, for example persuasive power, can be used over different stakeholder groups to ensure organizations are motivated and able to respond to changes in legislation. Approaches which seek to align the interests and values of stakeholders, and provide incentives for stakeholders to cooperate on advancing sustainable practices may be more fruitful in comparison with coercive approaches alone (Hörisch et al., 2014).  Limitations and Directions for Future Research Our research is not without limitations. Firstly, the qualitative approach based on a series of 19 in-depth interviews with franchisors and senior head office staff limits our ability to generalize our findings. Whilst a qualitative approach was deemed appropriate in understanding the power of stakeholders, as it enables an understanding of behavior to be developed “from the point of view of those being studied” (Bryman, 1988, p. 46), we need to be cautious in generalizing to other contexts. A quantitative study could help overcome limitations of generalizability, and be used to assess franchisor perceptions of stakeholder power (persuasion, and coercive, legitimate and competent authority) and engagement to determine their influence in the implementation process. Secondly, our study only considers the views of franchisors and their head office staff. Whilst we believe their perceptions are critical in understanding the implementation process, particularly in a context where changes have been mandated through regulation, it could be interesting in future research to explore the perceptions of other stakeholders, e.g., franchisees, franchisee employees and customers to determine how well franchisors truly understand the issues. Such an approach could enable more practical insights for franchisors. Thirdly, our study deals with the French market only. Given that all European member states are subject to the EU Waste Framework Directive, it could be of interest to conduct a multi-country study within Europe in order to explore the potential effects of cultural or institutional factors. Fourthly, another direction for future research could consist of studying the green practices of chains that operate internationally to determine if/how differences in stakeholder influences in different markets affect implementation in those markets.  Due to the need for ever greener practices not just in the fast food sector but other sectors where franchising is prevalent, we hope our findings will encourage further research on green practices in franchise chains given the particular challenges franchisees infer.

THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS FRANCHISING  IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY ABSTRACT Although franchise and management contracts constitute the dominant way of organizing business-to-business relationships within hotel chains, no study has compared their relative performance. This paper aims to explain their differences and assess their impact on online scores, currently a key performance indicator in the hotel industry. We argue that franchises are less effective than management contracts for operating upscale hotels due to the relative advantages that the latter have in transferring and enforcing tacit knowledge, typically embedded in skilled staff and very relevant in such quality-tier hotels. Conversely, franchising is better for large hotels because, first, its incentive structure better addresses managerial shirking (typically more severe as hotel size increases) and, second, it offers advantages when the normalization of business procedures is key to success (as is true for large establishments). Our empirical findings broadly support these arguments in a dataset of 220 Spanish hotel groups, also providing evidence that no single organizational solution fits all situations.Key words: Franchising, management contract, hotel industry, knowledge, online scores TO DO OR TO TEACH? THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS VS. FRANCHISING IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY INTRODUCTION As with the tourism industry, the hotel sector has grown significantly in recent decades. For instance, international tourist arrivals worldwide more than doubled during the 21 century. This growth has facilitated hotel firm specialization, driving companies to focus on fewer stages of the supply chain (Stigler, 1951). A clear example of this specialization is the move by the world's leading hotel groups to divest properties (i.e., real estate business) and specialize in hotel operations and brand management (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). This growth has resulted in the so-called asset-light and fee-oriented (ALFO) strategy (Li and Singal, 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014), which is strongly based on the development of effective business-to-business relationships between hoteliers. Starting years ago with US market leaders such as Marriot and Hilton, the ALFO strategy is currently a dominant trend in the industry (Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017; Mercier, 2020) and consists of growing by developing brands and business concepts and then incorporating affiliated hotels that pay a fee for their use. However, this affiliation means that several independent firms must cooperate by contributing those assets necessary to offer a full lodging service. The choice of how to implement this cooperation between firms is key to success according to the interorganizational relationship literature (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Gulati and Singh, 1998; Williamson, 1991).  International tourist arrivals rose worldwide from 686 million in 2000 to 1.461 million in 2019, according to World Tourism Organization (available at: https://webunwto.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2020-01/Barometro-Jan-2020-EN-pre.pdf). We have not taken into account the year 2020 to avoid the COVID-19 pandemic effect which is not relevant in our analysis. Several papers have analyzed the influence on different performance measures of, first, the decision to affiliate with a brand or to remain unaffiliated (e.g., Carvell et al., 2016) and then the affiliation choice (e.g., Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosová et al., 2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Madanoglu and Karadag, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, these studies are substantially biased towards the analysis of franchised vs. owned establishments, probably because of the economic relevance of franchising in retailing and the interest arising from franchise contracts among academics (e.g.,Combs, Michael and Castrogiovanni, 2004; Dant and Kaufmann, 2003; Lafontaine, 1992; Williamson 1991). Furthermore, these studies are not conclusive. While some authors conclude that differences in the relative performance of governance forms are not systematic (e.g., Carvell et al., 2016; Kosová et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Vázquez, Mejía and Sánchez, 2020), others find significant impacts on various key performance indicators (KPIs), such as prices, occupancy rates, or profitability (e.g., Kalnins, 2016; Moon and Sharma, 2014; Piot-Lepetit et al., 2014). In addition to franchising, the hotel industry has adopted another organizational form that underpins the ALFO strategy: management contracts (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988). In the management contract, a hotel group that owns a well-known brand (and the related key assets such as know-how and a reservation system) agrees to use its assets in a hotel (owned by a local partner), assuming, unlike in a franchise agreement, the management of this property directly in exchange for a share of the revenues (base fee) and profits (incentive fee). In franchising, the hotel group (franchisor) standardizes the business format and creates a franchise package to transmit the know-how that enables the local partner (franchisee) to replicate the business concept successfully and run it almost independently in exchange for a franchise fee (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). Conversely, in the management contract, the hotel group (the management company) does not so explicitly transfer its know-how because its personnel run the property directly (Ferrary, 2015). In other words, the hotel group must “teach to manage” in franchising, while it must “manage” the property itself in a management contract. We argue that the difference between “doing” and “teaching to do” is not trivial for hotel management. Surprisingly, despite the relevance of management and franchise contracts in the hotel industry—the European average for management contracts and franchises in major hotel groups is 21% and 50%, and in the US, it is 13% and 85%, respectively (Collins and Perret, 2015)—little research has been done on their differences. Different comparisons have been made, but not between these two forms. Some authors group them into a single category, the ALFO strategy, to compare them with ownership and/or rental (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, Izadi, and Olya, 2020; Hua, DeFranco and Abbot, 2020; Fernández, González and López, 2021; Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019; Soh, Tan and Jang, 2013; 2014). Others, more numerous, seek to compare franchising with other organizational forms, ignoring management contracts (e.g.,Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015) or grouping them with company-owned establishments in a category called company-operated or company-managed hotels (e.g., Kosová, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Kosová and Sertsios, 2018, Kalnins, 2017, Zhang et al., 2015). The literature analyzing international hotel group expansion takes organizational forms as separate categories and highlights their differences (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018), but they do not analyze the effect on performance, instead examining the probability of choosing one form depending on host country characteristics and other contextual factors. This paper aims to compare the performance of franchising and management contracts, studying whether there are systematic differences in the characteristics of the hotels in which one formula outperforms another. Thus, we assume that no contract solution systematically outperforms the other, nor does it always produce better results. In this regard, we hypothesize that the franchise and management contracts differ in asset allocation and control, yielding two effects. The first effect is related to how the managed/franchisee firms access the knowledge needed to run the hotel according to brand standards and routings (i.e., knowledge transfer problem). The second effect is linked to the capacity of both types of contracts to prevent misbehavior and managerial shirking at the local level. We maintain that management contracts outperform franchising for transferring tacit knowledge because “doing” works better than “teaching to do”, especially when tacit know-how is relevant. Conversely, franchising outperforms management contracts when shirking and the need for standardization are significant issues. Our performance variable is online scores, a KPI in the hotel industry (e.g., Kwok et al2017; Sainaghi et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). This study makes two contributions to the hospitality literature. First, we focus our comparison only on those organizational forms that represent the real choice of hotel groups (franchising vs. management contracts) given the predominance of the ALFO strategy. To date, the typical comparison in the literature on interorganizational relations and organizational economics (., Fadairo and Lanchimba, 2014; Kalnins, 2017; Kosová, Lafontaine, and Perrigot, 2013; Lawrence and Perrigot, 2015; Michael, 2000 and 2002) has been based on aggregations that, although correct from a theoretical standpoint, do not truly reflect the options that hotel groups actually consider in their expansion decisions. Furthermore, this fine-grained analysis avoids the problem of grouping substantially different organizational forms in a single category that can bias the results. Second, we contribute to the literature on organizational fit in the hotel industry because our results show that management contracts fit better in upscale hotels, where the business requires more tacit knowledge, suggesting that the transmission of know-how is more effective within the organization than between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al. 2008; Kogut and Zander, 1993; Shaw and Williams, 2009). This highlights a franchise weakness: the transfer of this type of knowledge when it is key for success (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). Similarly, we show that franchising moderates the negative effect of size on performance (Kosová and Sertsios, 2018). This suggests that its higher standardization capabilities, combined with its higher-powered incentives, make the franchise a better organizational form than management contracts in large hotels. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Franchise and management contracts stand out as prevalent business-to-business governance solutions used by large hotel groups to achieve rapid expansion in the industry (Balyozyan, Perret and Martin, 2017; Collins and Perret, 2015; 2019; Mercier, 2020). Both types of contracts have significant similarities that have led them to be jointly analyzed in the hospitality literature. In a franchise agreement, the franchisor (brand owner) owns a business concept and grants the right to operate it to the franchisee (hotel owner) for a term in exchange for a franchise fee (Brickley and Dark 1987; Rubin, 1978). In a management contract, the hotel owner (managed company) hires a management company as an agent to operate the hotel business on its behalf in exchange for a management fee (DeRoos, 2010; Eyster, 1988). A key common feature of these two types of contracts is that the ownership of the business format (held by a hotel group) is separate from the hotel ownership/property (held by the franchisee/managed firm) (Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Melissen, van Ginneken, and Wood, 2016). Therefore, both partners must ally to use their co-specialized resources and provide the service. One partner (i.e.,the franchisor/management company) provides the brand name and the method of doing business according to a proven business system. The other partner (i.e., franchisee/managed firm) contributes all local physical assets (facilities, furniture, fixtures, and equipment) and is entitled to the hotel’s residual income. Thus, in the transaction cost economics literature (Williamson, 1991), both franchise and management agreements generate a hybrid form of governance that contrasts with independent or chain-owned hotels (where hotel proprietors operate under their own brand). This shared feature has led franchise and management contracts to be considered equally valuable instruments for hotel groups' adoption of the so-called ALFO strategy. This strategy involves reducing the real estate ownership at stake and basing revenue generation on fees charged to owners of the property (Li and Singal 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014). Through franchise and management contracts, hotel groups can grow and leverage their intangible strategic assets (e.g., brand equity, business know-how, and reservation systems) without making large capital investments while basing their revenues on the collection of franchise and management feesAmong the main advantages attributed to the ALFO strategy, the hotel literature has highlighted its ability to reduce financial risks for hotel chains (Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn, Tang, and Jang, 2013; 2014) and to expand the hotel business, efficiently leveraging intangible assets and avoiding huge capital investments (e.g., Chen and Dimou, 2005; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Dev, Erramilli and Agarwal, 2002). However, although recent research does seem to confirm the risk advantages of this strategy (e.g., Kim, Noh, and Lee, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013; 2014), the evidence for its ability to improve hotel chains' performance, as measured by different financial ratios, is inconclusive. Whereas some studies suggest positive impacts on performance  The franchise fee follows a nonlinear payment schedule, with a fixed initial fee plus variable continuing fees (e.g., royalty fee, advertising or marketing fee, reservation fee, loyalty fee). The continuing fees can be tied to the gross revenue or the number of rooms (Collins and Perret, 2019; Mathewson and Winter, 1985). By contrast, the management fee is composed of a base fee and an incentive fee. The base fee can be a fixed sum or a percent of revenues/profits. The incentive fee depends on the achievement of a certain predefined profit level and is usually linked to the gross operating profit (for the operator to monitor the hotel’s operating costs). Thus, the incentive fee implies a risk-sharing arrangement with the management company (Hua, DeFranco, and Abbott, 2020). e.g., Sohn et al., 2013; Seo and Soh, 2019; Hua, DeFranco, and Abbot, 2020), others find only negligible differences (Bourke, Izadi, and Olia, 2020) or no difference in performance between asset-light and asset-based (i.e., with significant ownership or leased property stakes) hotel groups. ALFO also introduces other problems. According to agency theory arguments (Eisenhardt, 1989), the separation of hotel (i.e., real state) ownership from its strategic intangible assets (i.e.brand name and know-how) may also lead to significant conflicts of interest, with negative consequences for the hotel group and its brand equity (Brickley and Dark, 1987; Rivas, et al.2013; Rubin, 1978). On the one hand, the franchisee and the managed company as residual claimants of their establishments directly receive the result of their management efforts, which usually makes them well-motivated local hoteliers compared to hired managers of company-owned hotels (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017). However, the transfer of ownership that accompanies an ALFO strategy also implies the loss of control over hotel properties by the brand, which may undermine its ability to ensure compliance with its standards and lead to serious inconsistencies in quality and operations within the chain e.g., Brookes, Altinay and Aktas, 2015; Kruesi, Hemmington, and Kim, 2018; Michael, 2000, 2002; Sun, Park and He, 2019). Ultimately, this could result in worse service and lower customer satisfaction in franchise and managed hotels, challenging brand performance in the medium and long term. Comparative effectiveness of franchising vs. management contracts in ALFO strategies The success of the ALFO strategy as a preferred form of expansion may lead to the mistaken assumption that it fits, in terms of performance, all organizations in the hospitality industry (Blal and Bianchi, 2019). However, its effectiveness also depends on  (governance form) and where (contextual factors) it is applied. In this regard, recent studies highlight that its benefits/drawbacks may not necessarily be uniform across companies or even over time (Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Li and Singal, 2019; Seo and Soh, 2019; Sohn et al., 2014). Moreover, the effectiveness of the ALFO strategy may also depend on the contractual forms that support it, i.e.,franchise vs. management contracts. On this point, the interorganizational literature proposes that there is no universally superior organizational form (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Wiliamson, 1991). Rather, the distinctive characteristics of each organizational form make them better suited to respond to particular problems. However, most studies have overlooked the comparative analysis of franchise vs. management contracts and their differential effects on hotel performance (Kruesi et al., 2018). In fact, extant research on the impact of ALFO strategies on firms’ performance has ignored this issue, regarding both types of contract as a single or equivalent governance form (e.g., Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Bourke, et al., 2020; Hua, et al., 2020; Seo and Soh, 2019; Sohn et al., 2013). Therefore, a closer examination of the differences between these alternative models is necessary. Despite their similarities, franchise and management contracts have meaningful differences in their governance structure that can alter the type and severity of conflicts between brands and proprietors and, thus, the performance of hotel firms. Contractor and Kundu (1998) recognize that the main differencelies in the degree of control over strategic business assets (e.g., brand name, global reservation system, and business know-how embedded in routines and daily operations). This is because in a management contract, the hotel group retains the responsibility for directing and managing the establishment's operations. That is, the hotel group appoints one general manager to run the local hotel directly, usually in collaboration with other local managers who are hired by the managed company (Brooks and Roper, 2010; Contractor and Kundu, 1998; Kruesi et al., 2018; Melissen et al., 2016). Consequently, the owner of the strategic intangible business assets (the hotel group) has a substantial influence on most of the daily decisions of the local hotel, affecting its value. In contrast, under a franchise contract, the franchisor firm has less control over the intangible assets because it has delegated day-to-day management of such assets to the franchisee, and no franchisor representative is present daily at the local level. Clearly, the franchisees must abide by the contract and the operations manual, but they independently interpret how to operate the hotel establishment. Another key distinguishing feature is that the management contract entails the clearest separation between the operation of the hotel and its ownershipi.e., ownership over real estate and residual income) (Melissen et al., 2016). In franchised hotels, the person who operates the establishment (franchisee) also receives the residual income from the business; however, in managed hotels, the operator (management company) is not the residual claimant. These differences in terms of asset allocation and control can alter the ability to transfer knowledge and prevent opportunistic behavior within the hotel group. In this regard, we propose that no contractual solution is always superior, but its effectiveness will depend on the particular context in which it applies. Distinctive characteristics of the service provision will determine the knowledge transfer requirements and main agency problems supported by a hotel and, thus, the governance form best suited to respond to them. In hypothesis form:H1. The impact of governance form (franchise vs. management contract) on hotel performance is not direct but contingent on hotel characteristics. Management contract advantages in (tacit) knowledge transfer Unlike management contracts, franchising requires the franchisor to transfer business knowledge to franchisees because they are independently running the property and need to learn how to do so. This means that it is necessary to transfer knowledge between independent companies. Conversely, management contracts do not require any explicit transfer of knowledge because the general manager who operates the establishment and oversees the application of such know-how has already acquired it (i.e., they are employees of the management company). Consequently, here, the transfer of knowledge is within the management company and among its employees (Ferrary, 2015). In this regard, the organizational literature argues that the transfer of knowledge within an organization is less challenging than that between organizations (Easterby-Smith et al., 2008; Kogut and Zander, 1992; Shaw and Williams, 2009), meaning that management contracts hold a potential advantage. In the franchise context, the franchisor has the legal obligation to transfer its know-how to the franchisee, since it is assumed that such proprietary and distinctive knowledge is essential for the success of the franchise business. Furthermore, such knowledge is articulated into business practicese.g., Combs and Ketchen, 1999; Barthélemy, 2008) that are subsequently conveyed to the franchisee through contracts, operation manuals, initial training, and day-to-day assistance (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). This set of codified knowledge (i.e., franchise manuals and contracts) constitutes the franchisors’ main repository of knowledge (Solís and González, 2019). Conversely, in the management contract, the management company specializes in supplying its employees to the affiliated hotels. It focuses on recruiting, training, and managing qualified staff i.e., general managers and experts responsible for specialized departments) and then assigning them to the group’s establishments. The managed firm (i.e., hotel owner) hires the remaining line workers and deals with the real estate aspects of the business (Ferrary, 2015). Therefore, the main repository of knowledge is not the manuals, as in franchising, but the skilled staff of the hotel group, so the strategic know-how needed to operate the business remains in-houseFurthermore, compared to the knowledge acquired by independent franchisees, managerial know-how in management contracts is more likely to be of a tacit (non-codifiable) nature because knowledge acquisition is based on internal training, internships, and daily experiences within the hotel group. Internal knowledge transfer facilitates the informal links, communication, and learning by doing that are needed to develop and absorb tacit knowledge (Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). Because tacit knowledge cannot be fully articulated in electronic databases or manuals, passing on tacit business practices to independent franchisees can becomeimprecise or too expensive (Barthélemy, 2008; Combs et al., 2004; Paswan and Wittman, 2009). In sum, when hotel groups need to transfer highly tacit business know-how, they should benefit more from management contracts. The category of the hotel might determine the tacitness of the knowledge to be transferred. Upscale and luxury hotels are knowledge-intensive companies, and most of this know-how is more complex and difficult to codify (tacit) than that of lower-category hotels (Ferrary, 2015; León et al., 2011). Upscale hotels are also more difficult to monitor than lower-category hotels because it is very costly to detail ex-ante the attributes and procedures for delivering high-value service and, thus, establish reasonable standards to evaluate them. In this regard, Ehbauer and Gresel (2013) highlight how luxury retail still lacks adequate management tools because of the difficulty in designing qualitative and quantitative KPIs to ensure effective management in upscale stores. Therefore, in upscale or luxury hotels, which require the transfer of more tacit knowledge, the typical knowledge transfer between companies that the franchise entails and its subsequent articulation in manuals or documents is less effective than the transfer of knowledge within the company (i.e., based on the employees) typical of management contracts. In other words, “doing it” is easier than “teaching how to do it”. This difficulty may result in the inability to ensure adequate compliance with brand quality standards in high-end franchised hotels, ultimately resulting in poorer service and lower customer satisfaction (i.e., lower online scores) for franchised hotels than for managed hotels. Thus: H2. The interaction of franchise ( management) contracts and hotel category has a negative effect on online scores. Franchising advantages in preventing shirking and fostering standardization The governance differences between management contracts and franchising may also affect the severity of the different types of opportunism that may occur at the establishment level. First, in any network of geographically dispersed establishments, it is necessary to prevent shirking in the effort of the local manager (Rubin, 1978). Both contract forms provide a helpful tool to reduce this problem because managed firms and franchisees both bear the economic and financial risks of their actions because they are the residual claimants on the hotel’s profits. However, management contracts likely offer a weaker solution to this problem than franchising. Unlike franchisees, the general managers of managed hotels have no residual claim on the profits of the establishments because they are employees of the management company. This condition provides them with less powerful incentives to perform (e.g., to closely supervise hotel personnel and operations) (Freedman and Kosová, 2012; Hodari et al., 2017). Management companies monitor their behavior and can introduce incentive systems that better align interests, such as performance-based variable pay (e.g., executive bonus plans), which links managers’ compensation with hotel performance measures (Namasivayam et al., 2007; Patiar and Wang, 2020). However, these compensation plans cannot replicate the high-powered incentives of  In managed and franchised hotels, the hotel chain only partially retains the role of the residual claimant through franchise and management fees. These fees are mainly linked to the number of rooms or revenues per room (ranging 1-5%) in franchising (Collins and Perret, 2019) and mainly linked to gross operating revenue (ranging 2-4%) or operating profit (under 15%) in management contracts (Balyozyan et al., 2017). franchisees tied to their position as hotel proprietors (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Hajdini and Windsperger, 2019). Second, both franchisees and managed hotels can use their leeway as hotel proprietors to free-ride on brand equity and maximize profits at the local level at the expense of the overall interests of the hotel group. This theoretical problem translates into different types of misbehavior that have been studied for both franchises (Brickley and Dark, 1987; El Akremi ., 2011; Kidwell et al., 2007; Michael, 2002) and management contracts (van Ginneken et al2019; Schlup, 2004; Turner and Guilding, 2010). There are also differences in how free-riding is solved under these governance forms. We argue that a management contract reduces free-riding problems more easily than franchising because the former has an advantage over the latter in terms of supervision and monitoring. The general manager of the managed hotel, i.e., an employee of the brand owner, holds a more advantageous position for monitoring and preventing opportunistic behavior than the auditors, external supervisors, or mystery shoppers that a franchisor might establish to control franchisee behavior. In sum, management contracts solve free-riding on brand equity better than franchise contracts but worsen the problem of managerial shirking. This paper considers hotel size as a relevant contingency factor for assessing managerial shirking but with no significant effect on free-riding problems in hotel groups. The reason is that we consider the size of a particular hotel property and not the size of the chain (i.e., number of  Opportunistic behavior in franchise relationships usually includes failure to meet chain service and quality standards, unjustified price increases, concealment of local information useful to the chain, nonpayment of royalties, or undue deviation from standards. In management contracts, Turner and Guilding (2010) underline a horizon problem. Managed hotels will be interested in those investments that contribute most to improving the hotel’s net benefits (bottom-line) in both the short and long term. Conversely, the management company will prefer those investments that can enhance overall brand value or hotel revenue (or gross profits) in the short term (i.e.management and incentive fees). branded hotels). The number of rooms or guests directly affects the monitoring and administrative efforts required from managers (related to shirking) but not necessarily the abuse of shared brand assets (related to free-riding)—i.e., chain size and brand value could make free-riding on shared assets more appealing (Shane, 2001). A management error in a large hotel can be extremely costly because of the number of employees, assets, and guests involved. Large hotels require more planning and supervising efforts than smaller hotels because, due to the size of their operations, nothing can be left to chance (i.e., their responsiveness is very limited) (Hodari and Sturman, 2014). In line with this argument, Kosová and Sertsios (2018) found that hotels far away from their franchisor’s headquarters (i.e., more difficult to monitor) were larger, but this size effect did not exist for chain-managed hotels. This finding supports the claim that the high-powered incentives of franchisees are especially useful for operating large establishments. Furthermore, large hotels require more standardized work processes than smaller ones because other coordination mechanisms (e.g., direct supervision) are not effective in this type of organization (machine bureaucracy in terms of Mintzberg, 1979) (Baker and Cullen, 1993; Sutton and Dobbin, 1996). Franchising offers an advantage over management contracts when working under normalized environments because franchisees are used to employing standardized routines. Franchise businesses develop a set of formal and routine procedures to transfer their explicit knowledge and practices to franchisees (Paswan and Wittmann, 2009). The potential cognitive, cultural, and/or interest distance with their franchisee partners, together with the impossibility of resorting to hierarchical authority to oversee franchisee behaviors, means that franchisors must develop routine procedures, rules, and policies (contained, for example, in the franchise manual) to guide cooperation between the partners (Knott, 2003; Winter, Szulanski, Ringov, and Jensen, 2012). In fact, the ability to create \"standard operating routines\" and communicate and transfer them to their franchisees is considered a key alliance capability in franchise chains (Gillis et al2020). Moreover, we expect this \"alliance management capability\" represents a differential advantage of the franchise agreement comprising the ability to ensure coordination and standardization in challenging contexts, such as in large hotels. In sum, we expect franchising to be better suited to larger hotels than management contracts, resulting in better service and online scores of large franchised (vs. managed) hotels. H3. The interaction of franchise (vs. management) contracts and hotel size has a positive effect on online scores.EMPIRICAL SETTING To test our hypotheses, we use a dataset consisting of the 250 most outstanding hotel groups with establishments in Spain during 2018. These hotel groups ran 3,105 establishments (505,752 rooms) in Spain at the beginning of 2018 out of a population composed of 3,887 hotels belonging to hotel groups (Nota, 2018). These figures do not take into account independent hotels, which were not considered in the empirical analysis because the aim of the paper leads us to focus only on hotel chains (i.e., independent hotels are always company-owned hotels, so we do not observe variability in terms of organizational forms). The Spanish hotel industry is an appropriate setting because Spain’s tourism industry is a consolidated sector, occupying the second position in the world by the number of international tourist arrivals and receipts (World Tourism Organization, 2019; p. 9). We have focused on hotels from a single country—Spain—to maintain control over the possible effect that different countries may have on the choice of governance forms (e.g.,sector organization, regulation and economic and political stability) (Lafontaine et al., 2017). Using a single country also avoids the appearance of bias in online reviews from nation-specific features (Radojevic et al., 2017). Data regarding the establishment features (governance form, stars, rooms, location, restaurants, hotel group, and opening date) were obtained from Alimarket, a well-known economic data producer in Spain. Given our interest in comparing franchising and management contracts (using chain-owned hotels as a control group), we restricted the dataset in the following way. First, we did not consider leased hotels because we did not want to contaminate our control group with other organizational forms in which different conflicts of interest might exist (real estate owner and the hotel group). Second, we also ruled out those establishments whose business concept was not the canonical example of hotel accommodation, as these might introduce noise in the estimations. We next rejected apartments, focusing only on hotels and aparthotels, because the core services differ significantly (e.g., meals, bedmaking, cleaning, etc.). Similarly, we rejected minor types, such as hostels, rural tourism establishments, and holiday villages. Finally, after rejecting those hotels for which we lacked information for all the variables, our dataset was 1,664 hotels belonging to 220 hotel groups. 3.1 Variables The dependent variable is Score, which is the weighted mean of three website scores for each hotel after homogenizing their scales. We took these scores from the Booking, Expedia, andTripAdvisor websites between March and June 2018. We weighted each website score by its number of comments. Website scores are increasingly used by hotel customers in their booking decisions (Cantallops and Salvi, 2014), thus becoming KPIs and being increasingly used in academic papers (Kwok et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018). We use two different dichotomous variables to identify the governance form of hotel The variable Franchising takes the value “1” when the chain operates a hotel through a franchise contract and “0” otherwise. Similarly, the variable Management takes the value “1” when the hotel group operates the lodging establishment through a management contract. Because of our research methodology, the variable governance form also acts as a dependent variable in an auxiliary regression, in addition to a predictor of online scores. Upscale is a dummy variable that takes the value “1” if hotel has more than three stars and “0” otherwise In Spain, the hotel category is measured from one to five stars. We consider establishments with fewer than four stars to be different types of economy hotels. Conversely, upscale full-service hotels are those classified as 4- and 5-star hotels and are characterized by offering more sophisticated services and larger rooms. Specifically, 5-star hotels are featured by having the best-equipped facilities and offering the most sophisticated set of services. The variable LRooms quantifies the size of the establishment as the logarithm of its number of rooms. Renewal measures the number of years since the establishment was built or renovated and is utilized as a proxy of the establishment’s maintenance needs. Restaurants alludes to the number of eating places in the establishment and is used as a control variable. Hotel group-z are dummy variables constructed for each of the =1, …, 220) hotel groups included in the study. The list of hotel groups was extracted from the Report of Hotel Groups in Spain 2018 (Nota, 2018) and aims to control for potential hotel group effects, such as corporate strategy or preferences in terms of governance forms. Lastly, and although we refer to this in greater detail in the estimation section, to control for self-selection bias in the choice of the governance form, we use two variables as main instruments: Geographic concentration and Ratio of j-form hotelsGeographic concentrationrefers to the number of establishments of a hotel group in a province. Ratio of j-form hotelsmeasures, for each establishment , the ratio of establishments that its hotel group maintains in the same province with organizational form  over the total of the hotel group’s establishments in that province. The variables are summarized in Table 1, Table 2 displays descriptive statistics, and Table 3 shows the number of hotels in the dataset per governance form and category. Dependent Variables Definition Score Weighted mean of online ratings for hotel Franchising 1 for hotels operated under a franchise contract Management 1 for hotels operated under a management contract Independent Variables Definition Upscale 1 for a 4- or 5-Star hotel LRooms Log of the number of rooms Renewal Number of years since the hotel facility was built or renovated Restaurants Number of restaurants in the hotel.

This problem recurs in research (Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Mesquita and Brush, 2008), and several authors have insisted on the fact that the choice of governance form may be made systematically rather than randomly (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Shaver, 1998). Hotel group managers may self-select into different governance forms (i.e., types of affiliated hotels). They could decide considering the alternative that they expect to be more cost-effective for the hotel group. Therefore, a simple OLS of the Score (performance) as a function of the governance form may produce biased estimations (Hamilton and Nickerson, 2003; Masten, 1996; Mayer and Nickerson, 2005). To correct this bias, we rely on the method proposed by Heckman (1979), which consists of running a two-equation model. The first is a “treatment” model that explains the self-selection decision. The second is a performance regression, which is estimated to fit the self-selection of the first equation. The two-stage estimator used in the model is shown in Maddala (1983: 120-122) and the Stata reference manual (v.14, p. 59-64). In our case, we estimate a probit model of the treatment equation that is specified as follows: Franchising/ManagementUpscale*LRooms + Renewal +Restaurants +  Geographic concentration + Ratio of franchised hotels + Ratio of managed hotels + Ratio of chain-owned hotels + Hotel group 1 +…+Hotel group 220 + ε                             [Eq. 1]In Equation (1), is the random error term and Franchising/Management represents unobservable measures of the organizational form. Nevertheless, we do see the chosen governance form, a dichotomous variable, Franchising/Management, with Franchising/Management= 0 if Franchising/Management and Franchising/Management= 1 if  Franchising/ManagementThe second step estimates the scores conditioned by the election of the governance form and other hotel features as follows: Score =   β*Upscale + β*LRooms + β*Renewal + β*Restaurants + βFranchising/Management + β*Franchising/Management *Upscale+ *Franchising/Management *LRooms+ β*Franchising/Management*Renewal + β*Hotel group 1 +…+ β*Hotel group 220 + β*Mills_Ratio + ε                                                                                                                                                             [Eq. 2]It is important to note that we must econometrically identify Equation (1). This means that we need to introduce at least one instrument in the treatment regression (first stage) that is not considered in the performance regression (second stage). Specifically, we use Geographic concentration and Ratio of franchised/managed/chain-owned hotels as the instruments for Franchising/Management, which are the endogenous variables. We expect the ratio of hotels in a hotel group with governance form  in a given province to be inversely related to the unit costs of monitoring establishments with identical governance forms (Kosová et al., 2013). This ratio captures the unobservable costs of selecting a governance form in a given province. Besides, there may be economies of scale in the mechanisms and activities developed to control each governance form (Dahlstrom et al., 2009; Hoffman and Preble, 2003; Shane, 1996). In short, as the ratio of establishments with a given governance form in a geographic area increases, the cost of controlling additional establishments with that governance form decreases and the likelihood of choosing it for other establishments increases. The Geographic concentration variable allows us to take into account the size of the hotel group. Therefore, it facilitates weighting the effect of the economies of scale that we have approximated using the previous variable. It is reasonable to believe that neither of the two instrumental variables influences the online scores. Actually, when guests rate a hotel, they do not necessarily know either the total number of hotels of the hotel group in the province or which have the same governance form as the one in which they are staying. 3.3 Results Table 4 shows the main results reflecting the performance comparison of hotels operated under franchise and management contracts. Although our interest is in the second stage, it also shows the first-stage results for their methodological value (Appendix 1 summarizes descriptive statistics for the two-stage estimations). These resultssuggest that Heckman's correction is not needed. The coefficients of Hazardwhich is the parameter that Stata uses to estimate i.e., the correlation between the error terms of equations [1] and [2]), are not significantly different from zero, and thus we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between these error terms. Therefore, the equations can be considered independent because bias selection is statistically nonsignificant. Furthermore, some of our instruments are statistically significant (Ratio of franchised/managed are significant and have the expected effect on the organizational form), which suggests that they fulfill the requirement that they should be correlated with the choice of organizational form so they can identify the equation [1]. For the second stage, we estimated a baseline model with the direct effects and an augmented model in which we also consider the interactive effects of the organizational form and the features of the hotels. The results of the baseline models in Table 4 indicate, first, that the hotel scores positively depend on their category and on the number of restaurants and negatively depend on the size of the hotel (in terms of rooms) and on the renewal date of the facilities. However, the Franchising coefficient is not statistically significant, suggesting that none of these organizational forms is better on average in terms of scores. This is an expected result because it broadly supports the idea that there is no universally superior organizational form that works for all types of hotels (in regard to improving performance) (hypothesis 1). Second, the augmented model results reflect two important findings. On the one hand, we observe that when hotel groups decide to operate upscale hotels under franchise contracts, the expected performance in terms of score is lower (6F-M= -0.3475 p < 0.01) than that at upscale hotels run under management contracts. Consequently, it seems that franchising is the worst solution for higher-category hotels, as proposed in hypothesis 2. By contrast, franchising positively moderates the negative effect of hotel size on score. We obtain a positive and significant parameter for the interactive effect in Table 4 (7F-M0.1812 p < 0.05) as expected (hypothesis 3). This means that for large hotels, franchising  Please note that these two variables do not need to sum to 1 because in the ratio calculations, we consider the four existing types of organizational form. Consequently, they can be considered simultaneously in the regression. is more effective than management contracts (i.e., it mitigates the impact of size on scores).Predictors First Stage: Estimates (β) for Governance formSecond Stage: Estimates (β) for ScoreFranchising vs. Management Franchised  and Management Baseline model      Augmented model Upscale -1.0525677** .4854087*** .62254414*** LRooms .117914 -.12671228*** -.17564839*** Renewal .02982326 -.01024148* -.00789178 Restaurants .00295741 .06349429** .06690741** Franchising .06080103 -.47803964 Franchising x Upscale -.34749606*** Franchising x LRooms .18123349** Franchising x Renewal -.01079423 Geographic concentration .00847343 Ratio of franchised hotels     4.9570793*** Ratio of managed hotels -2.4955424* Hazard -.00848623  -.04150931 Cons -1.3599676 8.4227736*** 8.5241422*** 467 467 467 Goodness of fit Wald chi102.51*** =15.82 Wald chi116.26*** =17.30 LegendEstimates (standard deviation): *p<0.10; **p<0.05; ***p<0.01. Table 4: Regression models (I)As a robustness check, we also present the results from comparing the performance of franchised and managed hotels with that of company-owned hotels (Table 5). The aim of adding this comparison is twofold. First, it facilitates the comparison of our results with the extant literature and, second, it helps check the soundness of the hypotheses if they can also predict the differences with these new comparisons. Panel A compares franchised and chain-owned establishments (the dependent variable in the first stage is Franchising) and Panel B considers hotels operated under management contracts and chain-owned hotels (the dependent variable in the first stage is ManagementThe results corroborate our previous main findings. First, Panel A in Table 5 (augmented model) shows that the choice of franchising also reduces the positive effect Upscale on the expected score when compared with chain-owned hotels (6F-O0.3388 p < 0.01). Meanwhile, Panel B in 5 (augmented model) shows that managed hotels are not significantly different in terms of score from company-owned hotels for operating upscale establishments. Both results are consistent with H2, which argues that franchising is the less appropriate organizational form for operating upscale hotels. Second, the Franchising x LRooms parameter is also positive and significant in the augmented model of Panel A in 5 (7F-O= 0.1631 p < 0.1) but is not statistically significant in the estimate of Management x LRooms (Panel B in 5), which again is consistent with H3. Finally, the Management coefficient in Panel B in 5 (i.e., managed vs. owned hotels) is significant and negative (5M-O= -0.1122 p < 0.05), which suggests that management contracts deliver worse scores than company-owned hotels, irrespective of the characteristics of the hotels, in contrast to H1.

Table 5: Regression models (II)To reinforce the above results for H2 and H3, we plotted the interaction effects, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. These figures show the relationship between the category/size of the hotel (the x axis) and scores (y axis) for each value of the moderating variable (i.e.,franchise and management contract). As shown in Figure 1, as the category of the hotel increases, although both governance forms enhance scores, franchising becomes a worse choice compared to management contracts (H2) because its scores grow at a lower rate. Figure 2 shows that as the size of the hotel increases, the two forms of governance clearly have differing performance. Management contracts worsen their scores, while franchising improves them, albeit slightly (H3). Consequently, above a certain size, franchised hotels exceed the scores of managed hotels, making franchising a better option for large establishments. Figure 1: Interaction effect of the governance form (franchise vs. management contract) and the hotel category on scores 0 low1 highManagementFranchiseCategoryScores1 upscaleFigure 2: Interaction effect of the governance form (franchise vs. management contract) and the hotel size on scores DISCUSSION One of our most outstanding results is finding that franchise contracts are less effective for operating upscale hotels than management contracts. This finding is aligned with our second hypothesis, which argues that the disadvantages of franchising are more relevant in high-quality services because of the difficulties in transferring tacit knowledge. We sustain that this type of knowledge is more effectively transferred within organizations (i.e., through company-personnel interactions in daily work) than between organizations (i.e., through codification in different manuals and contractual documents). In other words, tacit knowledge is transferred more effectively in managed hotels than in franchised hotels. The initial training, remote assistance, and operations manuals (typical franchising procedures) are efficient devices for conveying explicit knowledge, but the transfer of tacit knowledge demands alternative tools (Paswan and Wittmann, 8,058,158,258,35Título del gráficoFranchiseManagementRoomsScores2009). Management contracts incorporate some of these tools because it is the company personnel themselves (e.g., the general manager) who teach the local partner as they their tasks (Ferrary, 2015; Kruesi et al., 2017; 2018). Here, employees are the repository of firms' tacit knowledge. We have not found any previous research that has compared these two organizational forms, so we cannot relate these findings to previous results. However, this weakness of franchising also holds when comparing franchised hotels with company-owned hotels (Table 5). This finding is consistent with previous results (e.g., Michael, 2000; Barthélemy, 2008), and it makes sense because company-owned establishments use the same tacit knowledge transmission system as managed properties (more effective than those in franchising). Relatedly, this argument of the tacitness of transferred knowledge has been empirically tested as a determinant of the entry mode of multinationals in host countries (Kogut and Zander, 1993). A second outstanding result is that franchising is more effective than management contracts for operating large hotels. The overall negative effect of hotel size on guests’ scores for the lodging service is more attenuated in franchised hotels than in managed establishments. This finding supports our third hypothesis that maintains that large hotels perform better when operated under the form of a franchise (vs. management contract). This is because the general manager (the franchisee) is more motivated to prevent managerial shirking than in managed hotels (an employee of the hotel group) and more used to applying standardized and codified business concepts (i.e., the franchise package is a standardization of the business model and a procedure for transfer to local partners) (Maalouf, Combs, Gillis, and Perryman, 2020). These relative advantages are especially relevant in larger hotels because both shirking (on manager effort) and the need for standardized procedures are also expected to increase with the size of the hotel (e.g.,Hodari and Sturman, 2014; Kosová and Sertsios, 2018). We have also found similar results when we compare franchising and ownership because, in terms of managerial shirking, managed hotels and company-owned hotels are similar. Kosová and Sertsios (2018) also found this correlation in their comparison of franchised and company-managed hotels. Finally, there is direct and indirect evidence corroborating the organizational fit hypothesis. The indirect clues come from the results just discussed, which show that management contracts are more suitable for operating upscale hotels, while franchising is better for operating large hotels. The direct evidence is derived from the lack of significance of the direct effects of the organizational form in most of the estimations Franchising in Tables 4 and 5). These results supporting the organizational fit hypothesis are also in line with those of other papers in different settings (., Gulati and Nickerson, 2008; Blal and Bianchi, 2019; Fernández, González and López, 2021). However, one of our results does not support this hypothesis because the direct result of Management suggests that managed hotels outperform company-owned hotels on average, regardless of property features. Clarification of this result requires further research on management contracts (as also suggested by Hua et al., 2020), since we only control for two characteristics of the establishments in which management contracts and ownership are very similar (knowledge-transfer problem: both are personnel-based and within the organization; and managerial shirking: both are employees). However, we cannot observe the allocation between the owner of the lodging property and the hotel management company of decision rights about operations and investments that can affect parties’ (mis)behavior in different settings (e.g., Arruñada, Garicano, and Vázquez, 2001). This lack could justify our empirical findings. CONCLUSION, MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS, AND LIMITATIONS In sum, this work shows that differences exist between the two main business-to-business organizational solutions that constitute the ALFO strategy, so one size does not fit all (i.e., there is no universally superior form, and the optimum is contingent on organizational problems). Management contracts prove more effective than franchising in upscale hotels, likely because they ensure an effective tacit knowledge transfer and reduce the agency conflicts caused by the separation of real estate from brand management. Conversely, franchise agreements seem more effective than management contracts for operating large hotels, arguably because they provide high-powered incentives to prevent managerial shirking and facilitate the standardization and codification of business procedures. The theoretical implication of this work is that to advance understanding of the choice of the business-to-business relationship, it is necessary to understand not only the problem we want to solve (the replication of a business concept without large capital investments) but also the comparative advantages of the organizational solutions we apply (i.e., the management contract vs. franchising). Hua et al. (2020) have recently shown that management contracts provide value, and we claim that the relative performance differs for each of these organizational solutions in guaranteeing the replication of knowledge and preventing shirking. However, other problems might remain hidden because the property rights granted to hoteliers are not known in detail. Contractual clauses (not observed) determine the distribution of decision rights and the risk allocation for operations and investments. This type of fine-grained study (e.g.Arruñada, Garicano, and Vázquez, 2001), which already exists in other types of contracts such as franchises or alliances, is missing for management contracts and is needed to understand how they truly work. The findings of this study also have managerial implications. Hotel groups are influenced by multiple and complex (financial and strategic) criteria when choosing the governance form of their hotels. Given the increasing strategic relevance of online scores (as drivers of consumer decisions and as a key business performance indicator), it is important to be aware of how the governance choice for a hotel may influence such scores. The consequences that this choice has on the incentives of hotel general managers are crucial, since within this sector, it is an axiom that \"a hotel is only as good as its manager\" (Forte, 1986, p. 119). From this view, our study highlights important differences between hotels under management and franchise contracts, which translate into their ability to satisfy guests. Specifically, hotel group managers should be aware that franchising is weak for transferring tacit knowledge, so they must develop complementary devices for transmitting this noncontractible knowledge to the local partner. Otherwise, the use of franchising should be restricted in favor of management contracts, for example, in upscale and luxury hotels. From this perspective, it makes sense to first use a management contract, and once the transfer of tacit knowledge is guaranteed, to transfer to a franchise agreement. This hybrid form is what practitioners call “manchising” (Collins and Perret, 2019). From the opposite perspective, i.e., in terms of protecting hotel group knowledge, management contracts are more effective because the business concept is not as explicitly transferred as in franchising. This is relevant because franchisees with an entrepreneurial orientation use franchising as “schools or entrepreneurial ‘internships’” to gather new skills before launching their own brand or concept (Grünhagen, González, Hussain, and Monteiro, 2020). The hotel group can prevent this by tying the franchisee to larger investments (properties) and high-quality-tier hotels, since this makes it more difficult for them to leave. Kosová and Sertsios (2018) empirically observe this practice for distant hotels. The paper has some limitations. The first limitation is that it is difficult to have precise information about the comment review policy of each website, which undoubtedly affects the scores. Unlike several previous papers, we believe that these potential biases have been corrected by aggregating several websites that use different algorithms and are run by different people. The second problem is related to the generalization of the results. Focusing on a single country has the advantage of controlling for institutional effects on the results because they are theoretically constant but limits the validity of our results when we want to extrapolate them to other countries with different institutional environments. Therefore, a strong need exists for an international comparative study. International franchising governance mode choice: A stakeholder perspective Vanessa P. G.

A quantitative analysis is employed using Brazilian Franchising Association data related to 463 observations of franchisors operations in each foreign market and databases from the International Monetary Fund and Global Entrepreneurship Index.

Key words: International franchising; Entry modes; Governance modes; Stakeholder theory INTRODUCTION Franchising is an important contractual entry mode in international markets, and its relevance is reflected in the market entry and international franchising literature since the early 1990s. International franchise chains operate in an interconnected web of relationships and present complex and specific configurations. The decision-making processes involving international franchising agreements are dynamic and often lead to non-traditional structures and governance modes different from the ones observed in domestic settings and international firms in general (Brown, Dev, & Zhou, 2003; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Ludvigsson-Wallette & Lawrence, 2020; Rosado-Serrano, Paul, & Dikova, 2018).  The governance mode choice is one of the major streams in international franchising research. It investigates the decision between higher control modes, such as company-operated outlets and joint venture franchising, and lower control modes, such as franchisee-operated arrangements. Most of the studies in this field focus on profit-maximization and cost-optimization aspects, offering one-dimensional explanations based on the franchisor perspective. However, as the choice of the international governance mode configures a complex and multidimensional decision-making process, it can be influenced by several factors besides the factors considered by rational models of mode choice, including the influence exerted by internal and external stakeholders (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  Despite the acknowledged importance of the stakeholder perspective to explain international franchising phenomena (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Jell-Ojobor & Alon, 2017; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Merrilees, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018), the theory is scarcely applied in franchising research (Raha & Hajdini, 2020). Hence, the purpose of this article is to analyze the international franchising governance mode choice through the lens of stakeholder theory, verifying the influence of other stakeholders on the franchisor decision.  To achieve this purpose, we employed a quantitative analysis through OLS (ordinary least square) regression model using Brazilian Franchising Association data related to 463 observations of Brazilian franchisors operations in each foreign market from 2017 to 2019. We also used databases from the International Monetary Fund, Global Entrepreneurship Index, and a cultural distance index based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions. We found that the business groups, government agencies, and host markets' networks of stakeholders are relevant to explain the Brazilian franchisors' governance mode decisions.The article contributes to the market entry and international franchising literature as it shifts the one-dimensional focus of the rational perspectives of mode choices to a dynamic approach that considers other franchise system stakeholders. In that way, we extend the understanding of the international mode choice decision, accounting for critical aspects that increase the explanatory power of previous rational models (Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). The remainder of this article is structured as follows. After this introduction, the next section presents the theoretical background and hypotheses. The third section shows the methodology adopted. The following section offers the empirical test of the hypotheses and results. Finally, we discuss the findings and present the conclusions of the study. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND International franchising  Franchising is a contractual agreement between two legally independent parts, a franchisor, and a franchisee, in which the franchisee pays fees to the franchisor for the right to sell products or services using its brand and business system. The franchising system has been expanding steadily as a business model worldwide, with impacts on outputs, job creation, economic modernization, and entrepreneurship development. According to the World Franchise Council, the top ten most prominent countries in the number of franchise brands contain 25,483 franchisors and 2,197,716 establishments as the total number of units. In the United States, the sector has created 8,434,090 million jobs and $787.51 billion worth of outputs as of 2019.  Its growing economic relevance is reflected in academic research, generating a large amount of multi-disciplinary research (ABF, 2020; Alon, 2004; Castrogiovanni, Combs, & Justis, 2006; Dant & Grünhagen, 2014; Dant, Grünhagen, & Windsperger, 2011; FRANdata, 2020).  The franchising business model is a prominent entry mode in international markets, classified as a contractual and medium-control mode. International franchising is considered a stream of literature distinct from the domestic franchise and the broader entry modes studies because of its specific characteristics. Most of the franchise chains are service companies in which consumption and production are inseparable, creating a distinct dynamic in international expansion. Aspects related to this dynamic, such as legal issues, knowledge transfer, monitoring, and control, require more complex franchise network configurations in international markets  (Brown et al., 2003; Cavusgil, Knight, & Riesenberger, 2017; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  One of the major fields in international franchising literature is the governance mode choice. It investigates the decision between higher control modes, such as company-operated outlets and joint venture franchising, and lower control modes, such as franchisee-operated modes like master franchise agreements and area developers. These modes differ in terms of the allocations of residual income, ownership, and decision rights between the franchisor and the partners in foreign countries. The degree of franchisor's investment and control increases from modes such as master franchising to company-owned outlets, as shown in Figure 1 (Benito, Petersen, & Welch, 2009; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Mumdžiev & Windsperger, 2011; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  ------------------------------------- Insert Figure 1 about here -------------------------------------- Company-owned outlets refer to direct investment made by the franchisor in the foreign markets. In franchising joint ventures, the franchisor enters in an equity relationship with the foreign partner to set a joint venture company, adopting a master franchising or area development agreement with the joint venture company to expand the system. In franchisee-owned outlets, the international franchisor sells the business concept to an individual franchisee in the host country. In a master franchising agreement, the franchisor grants to a master franchisee the right to operate franchise units and grant franchise rights to third parties. In an area development agreement, the franchisor grants the franchisees a defined territory in which they can develop units (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  The majority of the articles investigating franchising governance modes adopt the Agency theory (AT), Transaction Cost Theory (TCT), and Resource-Based View (RBV) as theoretical lenses, providing one-dimensional explanations focused on the franchisor perspective. Under AT and TCT, the choice of the governance mode in international markets is related to cost-minimizing and profit maximization strategies adopted by franchisors. According to RBV, the decision is connected to the franchisors' resources and competitive advantage (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  However, the choice of international governance modes configures a multidimensional and complex decision-making process. Several aspects besides the rational and cost-related concerns can influence it. For instance, franchise partners, the organizational structure of the business group, and policymakers may contribute through resources and network links that might affect the company's goals. Stakeholders such as unions, customers, suppliers, governments, and other interest groups exert pressures on the firms' decisions through explicit and implicit contracts (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). As highlighted by Brouthers and Hennart (2007), the inclusion of a multidimensional perspective such as the stakeholder theory can add a level of realism to the understanding of the international mode choice decision. Stakeholders perspective and international franchising The classical stakeholder definition given by Freeman (1984, p. 46) is \"any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objective.\" According to the stakeholder theory, besides the management concern about profit maximization and cost-optimization aspects, the claims and pressures of internal (owners, customers, employees, suppliers) and external stakeholders (governments, associations, competitors, consumers, the media) are also considered in the strategic decision making due to power, legitimacy, and urgency attributes of these stakeholders. That means management choices are a function of the stakeholders' influences (Hill & Jones, 1992; Laplume, Sonpar, & Litz, 2008; Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997; Rowley, 1997).  Despite its acknowledge relevance to explain franchise structures and dynamics (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014, 2017; Ludvigsson-Wallette & Lawrence, 2020; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018), there is a scarcity of studies that apply stakeholder theory in the franchising literature (Raha & Hajdini, 2020). Besides, most of the empirical studies adopting the stakeholder perspective to franchising research investigate topics related to corporate social responsibility. Only a few works approach international franchising decisions under a stakeholder frame of reference. Welsh et al. (2006) proposed a conceptual model of international retail franchising stakeholders in emerging markets. Altinay and Miles (2006) used the stakeholder theory to explain the selection process of international franchisees. Based on the stakeholder framework, Jung et al. (2018) analyzed the effect of corporate social responsibility on the relationship between internationalization and systematic risk. Table 1 summarizes the franchising articles applying the stakeholders' lens. ------------------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------------------- Brouthers and Hennart (2007) argue that if the stakeholders influence companies' strategic decisions, they might impact the international mode decisions as well. Through the same reasoning, Altinay and Miles (2006) propose that stakeholder theory can be applied to examine the decision-making processes in international franchising. Calls for application of stakeholder theory in international franchising are also stated by Merrilees (2014), Rosado-Serrano (2018), and Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger (2014, 2017).  The international franchising decision-making processes have specific characteristics that deviate from international firms in general. The role of stakeholders within the franchising system is complex, ambiguous, and overlapping when compared with traditional stakeholders' groups, requiring closer scrutiny to shed light on how they interact in foreign markets. Franchising creates other groups of stakeholders, such as the franchisees, employees of franchisees, institutional partners as government agencies and franchising associations, private equity, and business groups (Combs, Ketchen, Shook, & Short, 2011; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; B. Kim & Lee, 2020; Ludvigsson-Wallette & Lawrence, 2020).  Therefore, the choice of governance modes configures a decision-making process in international franchising that is dynamic and multidimensional. The learning process in global franchise groups needs to be considered, besides the cost-reduction and agency issues. For this reason, other dynamic theoretical approaches, such as the stakeholder theory, might account for important aspects influencing the international franchisor's choice of governance mode when expanding into foreign markets. Multiple other stakeholders and their complex relationships, formal and informal, influence these decisions (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014, 2017; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). This study explores the impact of three central stakeholders within the franchising system, the business groups network, government agencies, and host markets' networks.   Hypotheses  Business groups consist of individual firms linked to each other by multiple ties, coordinated by central administrative management to achieve a common goal. The main characteristics that distinguish the business groups from other organizational forms are administrative coordination and unitary direction (Cainelli & Iacobucci, 2011; Kim & Lui, 2015; Kumar, Pedersen, & Zattoni, 2008). Administrative coordination is achieved through different mechanisms such as the standardization of processes, mutual adjustment in decision planning and implementation, and direct supervision. Unitary direction consists of the \"influence over the decisions taken by the controlled companies in strategic areas such as investment, vertical integration, financial structure\" (Cainelli & Iacobucci, 2011, p. 1567).  Franchisors that belong to business groups in the domestic market might be subject to forms of unitary direction by means of pressures and influences from the group's companies and the holding management team. Besides, firms that belong to business groups obtain assets from their intragroup members, sharing valuable tangible and intangible resources (Khanna & Palepu, 2000; Kim & Lui, 2015). The stakeholders' relationships within the business groups enable dynamic exchanges and learning processes such as spillovers, imitation, resource sharing, and technological linkages, affecting their internationalization strategies. Other business group members can offer linkages with overseas firms, influencing the expansion approach through access to local structure, contacts, suppliers, and other resources (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Freeman, 1984; Hobdari, Gammeltoft, Li, & Meyer, 2017; Laplume et al., 2008; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018).  Therefore, being part of a business group can influence the franchisor's internationalization strategies, such as the decision about the level of control of the international governance mode. Franchisors that belong to business groups with other internationalized companies share the experience, contacts, and international partners. Thus, the business group resources and networks in the local market might favor low-control modes in foreign expansion: Hypothesis 1: Franchisors in business groups favor low-control modes in international markets. Institutional partners, such as universities, trade associations, and government agencies, are essential stakeholders for companies (Kim & Lui, 2015). The government agencies that provide financial and other support for business development are examples of key government actors that have interactions with organizations and can influence their decisions. These agencies respond to demands for efficiency and accountability, requiring compensation from companies in exchange for resources and influencing their decisions. Firms need to follow the agency's recommendations regarding strategy and investments (Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008; Parmigiani & Rivera-Santos, 2011).  Government agencies that support international business can play a major role in influencing the decisions of companies operating abroad, such as governance mode choices. Agencies programs such as the Franchising Brazil, a joint project of the Brazilian Franchising Association (ABF) and the Brazilian Agency for the Promotion of Exports and Investments (Apex-Brasil), organize trade fairs, and international commercial missions to promote experience exchange and networking. Through participation in this project, franchisors can have more opportunities to find local partners, counting on the agency's guidance and structure to develop their international expansion.  Thus, the government agency support enhances the probability of franchisors to choose low control modes since they have access to the structure and reliable partners in the local markets: Hypothesis 2: The support of government agencies favor a higher low-control mode ratio in international markets More recent developments of the stakeholder theory recognize that organizations are inserted in complex networks of relationships, each possessing its own set of stakeholders. Different stakeholder groups may interact, form alliances, and cooperate. Social network analysis is useful to explain contexts characterized by stakeholder multiplicity. The structure of the network and the organization's position within it affect the firms' reaction to the stakeholder influences (Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997). The host markets' network of stakeholders is essential as a reference group from which the franchisor can learn about their experience. They can provide critical operational knowledge about the market (Kim & Lui, 2015). When the host markets network of stakeholders is concentrated, and the local partners' relative centrality within this network is high, they have increased access and can provide or withhold access to others to the network (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997).  That is to say, in more concentrated networks, local partners with a position of centrality would offer to the franchisor access to these networks. Thus, local partners embedded in concentrated networks of stakeholders have more power and influence, obtained through the network's structure.  Thus, we hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 3. The more concentrated is the host market network of stakeholders, the higher the share of low-control operations. METHODOLOGYSample A representative sample of data from the Brazilian Franchising Association was used, with 463 observations about Brazilian franchisors operations in each foreign market related to the period from 2017 to 2019. The dataset has observations on 188 companies operating in 64 countries, and since there are no observations for all firms along the whole period, we considered only the most recent observation from each firm. Thus, there are 31 observations in 2017, 19 in 2018, and the remaining 413 observations were recorded in 2019. Besides the franchising dataset, we also used databases from the International Monetary Fund, Global Entrepreneurship Index and the franchising cultural distance index developed by Aliouche and Schlentrich (2011) based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions.Variables and measures Table 2 summarizes the variables adopted, measures, and sources of data. The dependent variable is the governance modes' level of control, measured by the ratio of the low-control units (franchisee-owned outlets, master franchisees' outlets, and area developers' outlets) to the total of foreign operations in each host market. We followed previous classifications that consider franchisee-operated arrangements such as franchisee-owned,  master franchisees, and area developers' outlets as low control modes (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Mumdžiev, 2011; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). The hypotheses involve three independent variables. Franchisors' enrollment in business groups (bus_group) is a dummy indicator that received the value of 1 if the franchisor is part of a business group in the domestic market, and zero otherwise. Participation in the Brazilian government agency internationalization project (gov_ag), with a value of 1 if the franchisor participates, and zero otherwise. And the network of stakeholders (network), measured through the Global Entrepreneurship Index item related to networking, which consists of how much the local entrepreneurs know each other, and their networks are concentrated. This indicator evaluates the countries' networking structure to those who want to do business, presenting higher scores for countries with more concentrated networks. For instance, the United Arab Emirates has the highest score, indicating that local entrepreneurs know each other and can make connections in the country. Trinidad and Tobago has the lowest score (GEDI, 2018).  Moreover, in conjunction with the above-mentioned independent variables, this article uses as controls several variables broadly adopted and tested by previous governance mode studies focused on profit-maximization and cost-optimization aspects: the franchisors' age (age), considering the time of existence since their foundation; franchisors' brand/reputation (adv_fee), indicator of the existence of an advertisement fee applied to franchisees; franchisors' financial resources (fee_average), measured by the average of franchising and initial fees; international experience, measured by the total number of units abroad (int_unit); international depth, measured by the number of units abroad per foreign country (un_country); host market potential, measured by the population (market_pot); economic development of the host countries (econ_devel), measured by the GDP per capita obtained from the International Monetary Fund; geographic distance (dist_geo) between home and host countries; cultural distance between home and host countries (dist_cult) accessed through the franchising cultural distance index (Aliouche & Schlentrich, 2011; Alon & McKee, 1999; Alon, Ni, & Wang, 2012; Aydin & Kacker, 1990; Baena, 2012, 2013; Burton, Cross, & Rhodes, 2000; Contractor & Kundu, 1998b, 1998b; Elango, 2007; Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014, 2017; Ni & Alon, 2010).  ------------------------------------- Insert Table 2 about here -------------------------------------- Research design Table 3 shows the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients for all variables under study. The correlation matrix revealed that correlations are relatively small. To test the hypotheses presented, the statistical method of analysis adopted was the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. All the non-binary variables are mean-centered, except for the economic development and market potential for which we used the logarithm of the GDP per capita and population, respectively. We estimate the following regression equation: 𝐿𝑂𝑊 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑅𝑂𝐿 𝑅𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂 + 𝛼𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑈𝑃𝑁𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑂𝑅𝐾𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠 + 𝛿where 𝐿𝑂𝑊 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑇𝑅𝑂𝐿 𝑅𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂 represents the governance modes' level of control, and the main variables of interest are the franchisors' participation in business groups (𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑈𝑃participation in the Brazilian government agency internationalization project (), and the features of the local network of stakeholders (𝑁𝐸𝑇𝑊𝑂𝑅𝐾) for each operation abroad. We included dummy variables to control for the sectoral fixed-effects (), and since the errors are correlated within groups of observation, the results of the regression are adjusted by standard errors clustered at the franchisors firms (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller, 2011).    ------------------------------------- Insert Table 3 about here -------------------------------------- RESULTS The results of the regression analysis are presented in Table 4. The first column (1) shows the estimates for the main variables of interest, while the column (2) shows only the control variables. Columns (3) and (4) present the estimates for the complete regression model. The latter model includes dummy variables to control the effects of the sector on the decision making of firms.   --------------------------------------- Insert Table 4 about here -------------------------------------- In general, our findings provide evidence for all three hypotheses. Results for the complete model (4) show a significant positive relationship (p <0.01) between being part of a business group and a higher low-control ratio, supporting Hypothesis 1. Stakeholders from business groups impact the franchisor's decision regarding the level of control of the international governance mode. The positive coefficient identified in the analyzed sample indicates that Brazilian franchisors' are influenced by business groups' stakeholders to choose low-control modes abroad (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008).  Hypothesis 2 asserts a positive relationship between the participation in the internationalization project of an important stakeholder, the Brazilian government, and a higher low-control mode ratio in international markets (Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008). The results confirm this hypothesis, showing a positive and significant relationship (p <0.05). Companies that participate in the internationalization project have opportunities for meeting local partners in trade fairs and missions promoted by the agency to facilitate the Brazilian franchisors' international expansion. With the guidance and help of an official government agency, franchisors can find reliable foreign partners and opt for low-control modes abroad. Results for the model (4) also support Hypothesis 3, showing a positive and significant effect (p <0.05) of the host markets network of stakeholders in a higher share of low-control operations. Local partners with more concentrated and strong networks can provide access to franchisors within the network, consisting of an important resource and advantage to the international expansion. Thus, franchisors expanding to host markets with local entrepreneurs that know each other and have concentrated networks have strong incentives to opt for low-control modes (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997). The results for the control variables' economic development and market potential are significant and show a negative relationship with the low-control ratio, as previously verified. More developed host countries with a higher market potential increase the incentives for high-control modes (Baena, 2012, 2013; Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995). The geographic distance has a positive relationship with the low-control mode ratio. Low-control modes can reduce monitoring costs in distant markets (Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995).  The cultural distance is negatively related to the low-control mode ratio. Cultural distance is a variable analyzed by several previous works, but the results are contradictory or inconclusive (Aliouche & Schlentrich, 2011; Baena, 2012, 2013; Baena & Cerviño, 2014; Burton et al., 2000; Contractor & Kundu, 1998a, 1998b; Fladmoe-Lindquist & Jacque, 1995). Contractor and Kundu (1998b) argue that the mixed results in empirical studies for cultural distance might be related to the contradictions between the need of local partners in culturally distant markets and the challenges related to the absorptive capacity of local partners in different cultural settings.  The international experience has a negative relationship with a higher low-control mode ratio, consistent with previous research. Franchisors with more international experience have more knowledge of how to do business abroad, reducing the risks and costs of choosing high control modes (Baena, 2012; Baena, 2013; Contractor & Kundu, 1998b, 1998a).  International depth is positively related to low-control ratio. Franchisors with more units in the same country have more low-control mode operations. Franchisee-operated modes such as master franchising and area development agreements usually define a territory in which local partners can develop units (Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). DISCUSSION The empirical analysis reveals that internal and external stakeholders influence the Brazilian franchisors' decisions regarding international governance modes. The franchisors' relationships within the business groups in the domestic market, with government agencies that support international business and with host markets' networks of stakeholders, impact the choice between low and high-control modes in foreign markets.  Being part of business groups has a positive relationship with a higher low-control ratio. That means, business group firms and the holding management team influence franchisors to choose low-control modes in international markets. Other internationalized companies within the same business groups can share experience, structure, and contacts with partners in foreign markets. Different companies from the same business group engage in action coordination and joint agreements with local partners to develop their operations (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Hobdari et al., 2017). One example is the Brazilian franchising group Paquetá - The Shoe Company, which controls the firms Dumond and Capodarte. Dumond started its internationalization in the 2000s with franchisee-operated modes. Capodartefollowed the same strategy, learning from Dumond's experience and counting with its local partners (Paquetá - The Shoe Company, 2015; Silva & Silva, 2014).   The participation in the internationalization project of the Brazilian government agency, Franchising Brazil Project, have a positive relationship with a higher low-control ratio, too. The agency can facilitate encounters with reliable foreign partners and thus influence franchisors to opt for low-control modes abroad (Freeman, 1984; Laplume et al., 2008; Parmigiani & Rivera-Santos, 2011). This was the case of the Brazilian foodservice franchisor Hot n' Tender – HNT. In 2018, the company participated in a mission to the Multi-Unit Franchising Conference Las Vegas promoted by Franchising Brazil Project. In this mission, the company signed a contract with the Rohan Group, a multi-unit franchisee, to open 50 outlets of the brand in the USA until 2025 (Apex-Brasil, 2020).  The structure of the host markets stakeholders' network also influences the Brazilian franchisors' decisions.  Franchisors expanding to host markets with more concentrated networks have strong incentives to choose low-control modes (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Neville & Menguc, 2006; Rowley, 1997). These results are aligned with de Almeida et al. (2018) findings of a qualitative study. They showed that the Brazilian franchisor Young Free (fictitious name), a textile company, decided to operate in the United Arab Emirates with a master franchisee because of its history of doing business in the country. In the United Arab Emirates, a country with a highly concentrated network of stakeholders in which local entrepreneurs know each other and can make connections (GEDI, 2018), the choice of a low-control governance mode with a local partner embedded in the business environment was more suitable.  CONCLUSIONIn this article, we analyzed the international franchising governance mode choice through the stakeholder lens. We verified the influence of other franchise system stakeholders on the franchisors' decisions. The results revealed that business groups, government agencies, and the host markets' network of stakeholders significantly impact the international governance mode choices. Being part of business groups in the domestic market, government agencies' support, and a more concentrated host market network of stakeholders increase the low-control mode ratio in international markets. Our findings contribute to the entry mode and international franchising literature as we shift the one-dimensional focus of the rational perspectives of mode choices to a dynamic approach that considers other franchise system stakeholders. By doing so, we amplify the understanding and bring more realism to the international governance mode choice research as suggested by several scholars (Altinay & Miles, 2006; Brouthers & Hennart, 2007; Jell-Ojobor & Alon, 2017; Jell-Ojobor & Windsperger, 2014; Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018). This study also provides a managerial contribution to franchisors seeking international expansion, presenting aspects to be evaluated and considered to the international governance mode choice.  Limitations One limitation of our study is the lack of data for other potentially relevant variables related to the stakeholder theory. For instance, future research can incorporate the firm's size to verify whether the influence of stakeholders on governance mode decisions changes according to the franchisors' size. Another limitation is related to possible home country context issues that might impact the role of stakeholders on governance mode decisions. The analysis presented is related to a sample of Brazilian franchisors. In order to understand possible context-related differences, a cross-national sample is needed. We also recognize that other stakeholders may have an important contribution to international franchising decisions, for instance, the host markets' government, employees, customers and the franchisees. Franchisees usually assume multiple stakeholder roles, taking aspects of customer, employee, and owner (Raha & Hajdini, 2020), and this is an feature that would benefit from further research in the international franchising stream.

Franchise System Configurations for High Performance: The Role of Dynamic Capabilities and Know-How Abstract The performance drivers of franchise systems have spawned considerable research interest. Almost exclusively this research has relied on independent sets of explanatory variables in linear analyses. These analyses mask the complex interdependencies that are likely to exist among key success factors, leading to faulty theory and misspecified implications for practice. In this paper, we propose a model that consistently articulates dynamic capabilities, operational capabilities (know-how) and performance. This model provides a canvas to a configuration approach to franchise system performance that accounts for complex interdependencies among dynamic capabilities, know-how and franchise ownership conditions (plural form versus “turnkey” franchisors). Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis of a sample of 119 France-based franchisors, the authors identify necessary and sufficient conditions to business format franchise system performance. These conditions include dynamic capabilities, both business and organizational know-how, and franchise ownership strategy that form causal paths towards franchise system performance. The study allows identifying the main know-how that are crucial (necessary) to performance and, in association with dynamic capabilities and depending upon the franchise ownership strategy, the conditions under which these different capabilities lead to high performance. We deepen the current understanding of configurations that promote the performance of franchise systems, offer important implications for theory and practice, and set new directions for future research on the strategic management of franchise systems. Key words: configuration approach, dynamic capabilities, fsQCA, know-how, performance INTRODUCTION Dynamic capabilities (DC), defined as “the firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (Teece et al., 1997, p. 516), are fundamental to firms' differential performance. Their role in firm strategy, value creation, and competitive advantage has attracted a great deal of interest among scholars (e.g. Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Helfat et al., 2007; Teece, 2007). Theoretical arguments have been advanced about the nature of DC and their relationship with firm performance. Research has found that DC are conducive to superior firm performance (Wang et al., 2015). However, the question as to why and under what conditions some firms are better at developing and applying DC than others remains under-researched and the debate about DC has reached a point where theoretical arguments should be further complemented by relevant empirical work (Protogerou et al., 2012). The question of whether and how DC affect performance is still open (Helfat et al., 2007). In addition, some scholars have limited the consideration of DC only in rapidly changing environments (e.g. Teece et al., 1997; Teece, 2007) leaving open the examination of their role under other environmental conditions.  This study aims to investigate how franchise systems can achieve high levels of performance under different configurations of DC and operational capabilities labeled as know-how (KH). In this study, DC are conceptualized as higher order strategic processes that integrate, recombine, and generate franchisors’ new organizational KH and franchisees’ new local KH, which in turn shape franchise system performance. We operationalize DC as a composite, unified construct defined by two interrelated, although distinct, dimensions: sensing capability and adaptive capability. Using a survey design in business format franchising, we consider KH at both organizational and local levels and we attempt to identify the KH that are decisive to performance. Finally, we introduce the franchising rate (proportion of franchised units in the system), a variable that reflects the strategic choice regarding the system development and the challenges it faces. By articulating DC and KH in relation to performance in different contexts and from the franchisors’ view, we aim to inform about the diversity of relevant dimensions of capabilities that form franchise management capabilities (Gillis et al., 2020).  This article contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it makes an explicit distinction between the DC higher order construct and operational capabilities. The relationship between DC and operational capabilities (know-how) cannot be considered as direct and linear, and both dynamic and operational capabilities have to be examined together in their relationship with performance. Our methodology, based on fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), is consistent with this framework and our results confirm the validity of this postulate. Second, it declines and explores the link between DC, operational capabilities, and performance in the context of franchising, in which the concept of DC has not been often used yet. We contend that DC and the franchise ownership strategy (plural form versus “turnkey” franchisors who franchise all, or almost all units), together with know-how (KH), allow for the identification of quasi-sufficient conditions for high performance in franchise systems. The results enrich the understanding of high-performing recipes to performance in franchise systems. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND Dynamic capabilities and operational capabilities “Dynamic capabilities are the firm’s processes that use resources—specifically the processes to integrate, reconfigure, gain and release resources—to match and even create market change. Dynamic capabilities thus are the organizational and strategic routines by which firms achieve new resource configurations and markets emerge, collide, split, evolve, and die” (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000, p. 1107). DC consist of specific strategic, organizational, and managerial processes such as strategic decision making, new business units’ development, alliances creation, and product development, which create value for the firm within dynamic markets by manipulating and reconfiguring resources (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997).  Teece (2018) argues that DC are easier to understand in the context of an organization's overall portfolio of capabilities, which can be thought of as working on two levels (Winter, 2003). At the base level are operational and other ordinary capabilities, the routine activities and administration that allow any organization to pursue a deﬁned set of activities, more or less efﬁciently. Above these is a layer of DC, which can be divided into “microfoundations” and higher-order capabilities (Teece, 2007). Microfoundations, which involve the adjustment and recombination of a firm’s existing ordinary capabilities as well as the development of new ones, are second-order DC. “Guiding these are the high-order dynamic capabilities by which management, supported by organizational processes, senses likely avenues for the future, devises business models to seize new or changed opportunities, and determines the best conﬁguration for the organization based on its existing form and the new plans for the future” (Teece, 2018, p. 41). In our paper, we will be referring to the DC as well as to the operational capabilities (labeled as KH). Dynamic and operational capabilities differ in their purposes and intended outcomes (Helfat and Winter, 2011). Following Protogerou et al. (2012), capabilities can be either operational or dynamic and they both reflect the firm’s capacity to perform a particular activity or function, but they can be distinguished along the two following aspects: “(i) operational capabilities help the firm to perform basic functional activities; while (ii) DC are referring to the transformation and reconfiguration of operational capabilities”. Assuming a hierarchical view of capabilities, we consider that higher-order DC serve as a basis for acquiring and reconfiguring lower-level capabilities in order to make a sustainable living.Relationships among dynamic capabilities, operational capabilities and performance The definition of DC specifies that, regardless of any ultimate effect, the effect of DC is primarily on the firm’s operational capabilities. In this way, the concept of DC is not necessarily linked to firm performance but foremost to the ability to reconfigure operational capabilities. Therefore, this definition specifies that DC can create value indirectly by changing operational capabilities. Any impact of DC on firm performance is “mediated” by operational capabilities.  This perspective consistently articulates DC with the resource-based view (RBV) framework. Following the RBV, each pool of resources –including operational capabilities- has its own intrinsic performance. This performance is dependent upon its VRIN (valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable) or VRIO (O for organization) attributes (Barney, 1991, 2002). However, a pool of resources is not forever VRIN and a source of superior performance. In an evolving social, economic and technological environment, these operational capabilities have to be modified and adapted to maintain a high level of efficiency and performance. DC come in as they allow creating, adjusting, reconfiguring, and leveraging resources and operational capabilities. Hence, operational capabilities and DC are directly linked to each other, but they do not play the same role regarding performance. Operational capabilities relate to technical fitness, defined by how effectively a capability performs its function, regardless of how well the capability enables a firm to make a living (Helfat et al., 2007). Some operational capabilities will be conducive to performance (they are “VRIN”), while others will not. Nevertheless, operational capabilities directly relate to present performance, although not in a linear and monotonic way, depending on their VRIN characteristics. DC are in appearance more directed toward performance because they relate to evolutionary or external fitness, that is to how well the capability enables a firm to make a living (Helfat et al., 2007). Evolutionary fitness references the selection environment and concerns sustainable or long-term performance. However, theoretically, there is no direct relationship between DC and the present performance of the firm, but only a direct relationship between DC and operational capabilities. DC drive to performance only because they allow creating or adjusting news capabilities, which present VRIN characteristics. Qualifying the relationships in terms of necessity and sufficiencyBecause there is no high performance without VRIN operational resources or capabilities in RBV, the relationship between operational capabilities and performance is of a necessary nature. This statement simply establishes that if we observe a firm with high performance, there must be some (VRIN) operational capabilities sustaining and explaining this performance. This does not mean that all or some operational capabilities will systematically lead to performance. There can be plenty of operational capabilities, effective at operating some particular tasks in a firm, which result in low performance if these capabilities or tasks are not useful to firm competitive advantage. Hence, operational capabilities are necessary to achieve high performance, but they are not sufficient. Even taking the definition of an operational capability at a certain level of generality, there is not one “super” capability, which would be sufficient by itself and forever to achieve high performance. An operational capability or a particular bundle of operational capabilities will lead to high performance only in some contexts and under particular conditions. Hence, operational capabilities are in a relation of necessary nature with performance, but they are not sufficient on their own to achieve high performance. For an operational capability or a bundle of capabilities to retain their VRIN feature and lead to high performance, it has to be reshaped from time to time. DC, by creating, adjusting, reconfiguring, and leveraging resources and operational capabilities play this role. Hence, in conjunction with operational capabilities (that they contribute to leverage, create, and adapt), DC can be seen as a sufficient condition to performance. Neither DC nor operational capabilities are sufficient by themselves. They are insufficient taken alone, but sufficient taken together (at least in some contexts). Hence, one can define DC in conjunction with operational capabilities (and vice versa) as quasi-sufficient or INUS condition for performanceEstablishing and qualifying the fundamental relationships between operational capabilities and DC allows the concepts to be properly articulated. However, it remains to give them substance: what are the core operational capabilities (or KH) that constitute the necessary conditions for high performance in franchise systems? How and under which conditions do they articulate with DC to lead to high performance? Figure 1. A model of the relationships among dynamic capabilities, operational capabilities and performance Legend: Operational capabilities are necessary conditions to high performance, and consistently, the set of high performing franchise systems is included into the set of systems with valuable operational capabilities. Sufficient conditions to high performance necessitate the articulation of some operational and some DC, under certain conditions. The set of high performing franchise systems is at the intersection of these three sets.                                                  In terms of FsQCA, dynamic and operational capabilities would be qualified as INUS condition. INUS means “Insufficient condition but Necessary part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition”. This is exactly what dynamic and operational capabilities in relation to performance are. Taken alone, they are insufficient, but taken together they are (necessary) part of a sufficient condition (although this condition is not necessary: it exists plenty of other conditions that can lead to high performance).Environmental or organizational conditions Set of (systems with) DC Set of (systems with) operational capabilities Set of high performing franchise systems DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES, OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES AND PERFORMANCE IN FRANCHISE SYSTEMS We consider the different franchise systems’ KH as operational capabilities. These can be understood as the “zero-order” capabilities needed for performing effectively day-to-day activities, such as offering particular products or addressing specific customer’s needs. Their renewal and reshaping by DC according to the franchisor’s strategic intent and environmental needs might be a prerequisite for sustainable competitive advantage. Operational capabilities: transferring valuable know-how at the local level and controlling the system We consider operational capabilities from the franchisor’s point of view, but we acknowledge that several operational capabilities or KH are transferred or even created at the franchisee level. Franchisors provide their franchisees with two major strategic assets—brand name and business practices. Specifically, they provide manufacturing capabilities, regulatory KH, information on managing and deploying their sales forces, and standard operating processes to manage franchised units effectively (Hoang and Rothaermel, 2010; Knott, 2003; Watson and Stanworth, 2006). The primary task of a franchisor is to create and maximize value through optimally transferring KH to franchisees. Beyond these franchisor-owned strategic assets, franchisors also build value creation on knowledge-sharing routines (Gillis et al., 2014). These routines include advice from franchisee consultants, newsletters, and national, regional, and local meetings. These routines not only allow franchisors to communicate current standards and to monitor franchisees, they also allow them to learn about franchisees’ adaptations or innovations, and then to share successful changes throughout the system (Bradach, 1998). They also allow franchisees to share ideas and learn from one another. Hence, the value creation in a franchise system does not only depend on the franchisor’s KH and operational capabilities, but also on the symbiosis between these partners, and on the franchisees’ KH and capabilities. The KH we have discussed so far are those, which are transferred to the franchisees and to the system units. They can be defined as “business KH” and are at the heart of value creation in franchise systems. They operate at the local level, but the franchisor remains in charge of these KH.  Other KH, which can be qualified as organizational, are not transferred to local units and are the exclusive responsibility of the franchisor. These organizational KH are numerous. We can mention the codification and transmission of knowledge to franchisees, the support to human resources management for franchisees, and the internal cohesion management (El Akremi et al., 2009). Among these organizational KH, one -namely the control of the system- is crucial to system performance, although probably in a contingent way (Yakimova, Owens, and Sydow, 2019). The franchise literature emphasizes the role of monitoring (Combs et al., 2011). Indeed, to protect the brand value and the business practices transferred to local units, the franchisor must deter deviant and opportunistic behaviors and must ensure that the business practices are correctly implemented. The need for the mastering of such monitoring capabilities is nevertheless contingent. A good mastering of control capabilities will be of greater importance for high performance when the system uniformity and integrity is at risk. Franchisors can also develop some KH that substitute/limit or complement the need to monitor the franchisees. In this regard, the management of internal cohesion in the system is an important capability, that is akin to relational form of governance (Cochet, Dormann, and Ehrmann, 2008). Having a good mastering of internal cohesion capability could limit the monitoring need or it could effectively complement it by making the franchisees more collaborative and proactive, e.g. in their reporting and their audits. Controls are not only coercive but also enabling (Yakimova et al., 2019). Including the mastering of cohesion in the system in the analysis makes it possible to consider the concept of control in a broader sense that is not limited to its monitoring or disciplinary nature. It allows embracing more broadly- even if not completely- the franchise management capabilities (Gillis et al, 2020), which are “the main cognitive, behavioral, and organizational routines that enable a franchisor to achieve both standardization and adaptation in working with franchisees\"Among the different KH in a franchise system, we contend that the 3 KH evoked -namely having a business KH of value and mastering the control and/or cohesion organizational KH- are crucial to performance. Consequently, we posit: H1: Business KH of value, mastering the control and/or cohesion organizational KH constitute altogether a necessary condition to high performance.  In terms of fsQCA: (Business KH of value + Mastering of control KH+ Mastering of cohesion KH)  High performance The sign “+” represents an inclusive or logical “or”. In terms of set theory, it refers to an union. The backward arrow means “is necessary for”. We could rephrase H1 by saying that the set of high performing systems is included into the union of the sets of highly valued business KH, and good mastering of control and cohesion organizational KH.                                                  Gillis et al. (2020) do not distinguish between KH and DC in the definition of their franchise management capability construct. Part of these management capabilities are subsumed in DC in our framework.H1 states that having one or the other of the three KH (or any combination of two of them or the combination of the three) is necessary to high performance. It might be that some combinations of two KH only constitute a necessary condition to high performance. This is an empirical issueFinally, there should be no misunderstanding regarding the purpose of this hypothesis. If H1 were to be not corroborated, it would not call into question the theoretical framework and model (which are by themselves not testable, but rather useful or not). It would rather indicate that high performance in franchise systems is based on a set of KH that is larger (or differently structured) than the three KH retained in our study tests. The fact that KH, if properly chosen, constitutes a necessary condition for high performance follows from our theoretical framework. However, it does not inform us about the main concern in management: under what circumstances do these KH lead to high performance, i.e can we find some conditions for the KH to be a sufficient condition to high performance? In that regard, as already outlined, a good mastering of control capabilities will be of greater importance for high performance when the system uniformity and integrity is at risk. The franchise literature identifies the development mode- a strategic variable reflected by the proportion of franchised units in the system- as such a risk (Gillis and                                                  On a theoretical ground, we can mention that H1 has a corollary. Indeed, if the union of the three KH is a necessary condition to high performance it follows that not mastering any of these KH is a sufficient condition to low performance.  Corollary of H1: Not mastering any of the KH is a sufficient condition to low performance. In fsQCA terms: (worthless Business KH * weak mastering of control KH * weak mastering of cohesion KH)  low performance The sign “*” represents an “and”, it refers to an intersection in terms of theoretic set. The arrow means “is sufficient for”. Combs, 2009; Gillis et al., 2020). First, because it refers to the acuteness of the risk of free riding in the system, as more franchisees in a system entails a greater risk of free riding (Michael, 2000). Furthermore, systems that make strong use of franchising compared to their rivals may have advantages regarding system innovation (especially at the local level), but at the expense of higher risks for system uniformity and probably at the expense of the plural form symbiosis itself (El Akremi et al., 2015). When the franchising rate increases, the franchisors' risk of losing control over business processes is greater (El Akremi et al., 2015). A high level of company ownership, in contrast, promotes standardization and guarantees valuable replication. It may help to diffuse novelty across the entire system while maintaining uniformity. The specific advantage of hierarchy via company ownership is that it helps secure chainwide standardization and increases strategic flexibility (Gillis and Combs, 2009). The mastering of control capabilities is thus crucial to achieve high performance when the franchising rate is high. On the contrary, in systems with low franchising rates, control and uniformity in the system may be maintained without necessarily mastering such capabilities. Hence: H2: A good mastering of control KH is a quasi-sufficient condition in a context of high franchising rate (or in “turnkey systems”).In fsQCA terms: (High franchising systems * good mastering of control capabilities) high performance The notion of quasi-sufficiency deserves further explanations. In fsQCA, we could reframe H2 by saying that “a good mastering of control KH” is an “INUS” condition of performance (Insufficient (by itself) but Necessary part of an Unecessary but Sufficient condition)”. This means that: i) the good mastering of control alone is not sufficient to lead to high performance, it will necessarily be associated with other conditions, in particular but not solely, a high franchising rate in H2 (“insufficient by itself but necessary part of”); and ii) There may be many other configurations that lead to high performance but do not necessarily include the control KH and a high franchising rate (“an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition”). In other words, our hypothesis stipulates that there will be at least one configuration in which the association of at least the good mastering of control KH and high franchising rate lead to high performance. However, particularly in our context where the different KH may interact to deliver high performance, we do not dismiss that the high performing configuration that associates control KH and high franchising rate, also further includes other KH. An association of control and cohesion KH would indicate that these KH are complementary rather than substitutes. The value of business KH could also integrate the configuration as business and organizational KH are interrelated in franchise systems (Perrigot et al., 2020). Whatever the specific form of this expected configuration, we expect that it will cover a significant part of all high performing configurations, but as the point underlined in point ii), many other high performing configurations may exist that do not include neither control nor a high franchising rate.  Dynamic Capabilities We expect that the system and local capabilities can be at the source of competitive advantage in certain contexts. However, exogenous (e.g. economic, technological) as well as endogenous (executive replacement, franchising rate) changes might well jeopardize this competitive advantage. To ensure the sustainability of operational capabilities as a source of competitive advantage and to promote long-term performance, the franchise system should develop DC. In other words, the ingredients we gave in H2 are not the whole recipes of configurations that drive to high performance. They constitute only a part of the recipe and we now include the DC in the analysis.Although DC are not to be analyzed in sequential terms (Gelhard et al., 2016), they are often decomposed in different subcomponents in a seemingly chronological order: sensing, seizing and reconfiguring/transforming (e.g. Teece, 2007; Ellonen et al., 2009) or absorptive, adaptive and innovative (e.g Wang et al., 2015). These categorizations can be applied to the context of franchising. The sensing component of DC relates to the “the ability of a firm to recognize the value of new, external information” (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990, p. 128). In the franchising context and from the franchisor’s point of view, this capability relates to the capability to capture and evaluate information from the environment from external partners as well as from franchisees. Hence, in our context, this capability is outward and inward looking. It is also linked to knowledge sharing (operating) routines between the franchisor and franchisees. Adaptive and innovative capabilities are sometimes gathered into transformative capabilities (Pandza and Holt, 2007; Wang et al., 2015), which relate to a firm’s ability to constantly redefine a portfolio of product or service opportunities based on knowledge endogenous to the firm (Pandza and Holt, 2007). These DC relate to the adaptation of operational capabilities at the franchisor level (e.g. capacity to integrate new knowledge, reconsideration of existing practices) and to the ability to foster innovation (e.g. use of information to launch novel product or services, ability to engender and support innovative behavior for franchisees but also for managers, new methods of production and new ways of doing things within the firms).  In our framework, all these dynamic sensing and transformative capabilities apply to the organizational as well as to business (local) operational capabilities. They are intended to adapt existing operational capabilities or to create novel capabilities when necessary, to enable the firm to make a living on the long run. By themselves, or in conjunction with operational capabilities, these DC constitute “franchise management capabilities” (Gillis, et al., 2020). A general hypothesis from these observations is straightforward. As DC are intended to make it possible to maintain the effectiveness of organizational KH and the value of the KH transferred to franchisees, we expect DC to be quasi-sufficient condition to high performance in association with KH. In other words, we expect to observe the presence of good sensing  good adaptive capabilities in conjunction with one or some KH in high performing configurations. Accordingly: H3: Sensing or adaptive DC are, in conjunction with KH, INUS conditions to performance included in high performing configurations.  Noting SENS the sensing DC and ADAP the adaptive DC, we state H3: (SENS + ADAP)*(Business KH of value + Mastering of control KH+ Mastering of cohesion high performance This hypothesis indicates that high performing configurations must include simultaneously DC and KH. This statement is theoretically correct. We expect in our framework that most high performing configurations will include these conditions but not necessarily all high performing configurations. Indeed, our model includes business KH, control and cohesion capabilities as the focal and most important KH in relation to performance. We nevertheless recognize that other organizational KH, not accounted for in our model, exist that could also be relevant for high performance in some contexts. It is quite conceivable that the (sensing and adaptive) DC apply to other organizational KH not included in our model to deliver performance. In other words, we cannot discard that some high performing configurations will exhibit only one or the other DC, and none of the operational capability retained in our model. These potential cases have a simple interpretation: in these configurations, the DC apply to other (non-measured) operational capabilities. Nevertheless, we expect that only few configurations will include DC without at least one of the operational capabilities, as we included in our model the most important and expected KH for high performance in franchise systems. Finally, we may observe some high performing configurations that exhibit only operational capabilities and no DC. These cases would refer to configurations where performance is more tenuous and less sustainable on the long term.  METHODOLOGY Sample and data collection Both mail and face-to-face survey methods were used to collect data from France-based franchisors. We used the franchise listings provided by the Fédération Française de la Franchise (French Franchise Federation) to obtain the franchisors' contact details. We also contacted franchise systems that were not in the listings but who had participated in a prior research project conducted by the authors. A total of 930 top executives of franchise systems actively operating in France were contacted in December 2017. The survey was addressed to the managing directors of each franchise organization. Our target respondents also included top executives with a deep understanding of the orientation of the franchising strategy, including network directors, directors of development and franchise directors. Because dynamic and operational capabilities are an organization-level construct, we believe that these respondents are appropriate informants for capturing dynamic and operational capabilities in their franchise organizations.  After three reminders at the beginning of 2018, we received a total of 108 questionnaires (at least partially completed). As a complementary data-collection method, we conducted personally administered surveys at the annual meeting of Salon de la Franchise(Franchise Exhibition) in March 2018. Fifty-five questionnaires were then gathered. Incomplete questionnaires were excluded, bringing the total number of usable questionnaires to 119. Our final sample consisted of 119 franchise organizations, for an overall response rate of 12.8%. By way of comparison, there were 1900 franchise systems in France in 2016. Considering that this study required the involvement of top franchise executives, the sample size is considered appropriate, and a similar sample size has been reported in prior studies investigating the strategic management of franchising systems. For example, Dada and Watson (2013) collected 95 usable questionnaires. A non-response bias analysis was conducted by comparing early versus late responses (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). We also conducted t-test comparisons between mail survey respondents and face-to-face survey respondents. According to the tests, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean responses for the constructs that were measured in the study.  Table 1. Sample characteristics Franchise systems’ characteristics Frequency Age  Less than 5 years 24% 6-10 years  24% 11-20 years 23% More than 20 years  29% Total100% Size 1-50 units  45% 51-100 units 18% 100-150 units More than 150 units 28% Total 100% Industry sector  Construction and estate agents Miscellaneous retail Food retail 10 % Domestic goods retail 11% Personal goods retail 8 % Hotels and restaurants 15% Hairdressing and beauty Services to individuals  18% Automobile services  Business services  12% Total 100% The sample includes both young and well-established franchise systems, along with both very small and very large franchise systems in various sectors (Table 1). The average age of franchise systems, defined as the number of years the company has been franchising, was 15 years, and the average size was 97.5 franchised units. These figures and the sample distributions are very close to the sample of the CSA 2016 survey on franchising which is representative of the French franchise systems (average age =14 years; average size=95 units). MeasuresA research instrument was developed to serve as a basis for collecting data pertaining to DC, operational capabilities, and franchise system performance. Where possible, existing constructs and measures were used to ensure their validity. All questionnaire items were operationalized using self-typing seven-point Likert scales, ranging from 1, strongly disagree, to 7, strongly agree. It should be noted that operationalization of resources and capabilities in empirical research has not yet reached standard measures (Protogerou et al., 2012). In this study, the development of scales was based on theoretical contributions from resource-based scholars (eg. Teece et al., 1997). For a complete overview of all the items used in the survey, please refer to the Appendix 1. DC construct was gaged by using two sub-dimensions, namely sensing and adaptive capabilities, while each of them was measured with specific items. In sum, we measured DC as a higher-order reflective construct using 19 items, which were adapted from Wang et al. (2015). To measure operational capabilities, franchisors were asked to indicate in a seven-point scale the degree to which different types of organizational KH were well mastered in their systems and the degree to which the different types of local KH transferred to franchisees were rare and inimitable, on several items. The monitoring/control side of organizational KH was measured with 4 items. The Cohesion capability was also measured through 4 items. To measure the value of business KH, we used the scale developed by El Akremi et al. (2009) and Ghantous et al. (2013), based on 9 items. These items allow qualifying the nature of business KH, especially regarding their scarcity and inimitability. Performance is a multidimensional concept for which it is possible to find a wide diversity of measurements (Rauch et al., 2009). This study uses perceived measures to operationalize franchise system performance. The two most commonly used measurements of franchise performance are system growth (e.g., Combs and Ketchen, 2003; Kaufmann and Dant, 1996; Shane, 1996) and financial performance (e.g., Combs and Ketchen, 2003; Hoover et al., 2003; Lafontaine, 1992; Michael, 2003). The first measurement reflects the increase in the number of franchised units. The second measurement is typically framed in terms of sales and/or profits. To assess the performance of franchise systems, we used the integrative measurement of entrepreneurial performance (Chandler and Hanks, 1993; Murphy et al., 1996) that integrates both growth and financial measurements.  Using a framework derived from the literature on alliances, Gillis et al. (2020) focus on three dimensions that reflect franchise management capabilities: communication, coordination and bonding. They aggregate these different operational capabilities into a multidimensional construct reflecting \"management capabilities\". By using a different framework, we distinguish the components of franchise management capabilities between KH and DC of adaptation and detection. In our framework it is the articulation between these capabilities and not their aggregation that constitutes the franchise management capabilities. Beyond these differences, we find similarities in the concepts measured: the \"knowledge sharing routines\" of Gillis et al. (2020), for example, are for us adaptive DC; the \"trust routines\" rather refer to the KH of cohesion while the standard operating routines are closer to the KH of control. Validation of measures Particular efforts have been made to minimize measurement errors and potential bias. In essence, construct validation of the perceptual measures was tested in two basic steps. The first one checked for content validity, requiring the identification of a group of measurement items, which are deemed to represent the construct of interest. The scales concerning DC measures were developed based on theoretical contributions and especially Teece et al.’s (1997) DC framework. The operational capabilities and franchise system performance scales employed have been adapted from existing and validated scales used in the franchising literature. Table 2.

This first axis explains much (44.14%) of the sum of total variance explained by the 3 first axes (71.61%). Dimension 2 (14.46%) relates to the “specificity” of the business KH, while dimension 3 (13.01%) relates to the sustainability of the value of business KH. Franchise system performance (5 items) Related (calibrated) variable in FsQCA: PERF0.920 0.804 The second step addressed construct validity, seeking to establish the extent to which the empirical indicators actually measure the construct. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s . All constructs exceed the recommended level of 0.7 and therefore the specified indicators are sufficient in their representation of the constructs (Table 2). Hence, all analyses provide reasonable confidence that the measures used in the present study are valid and reliable. Method of analysis The configurational approach is primarily based on the fundamental premise that in a RBV framework, which articulates dynamic and operational capabilities, the strategic development of the system and performance cannot rely only on linear or curvilinear relationships between these elements. Efforts to estimate average relationships are indeed inconsistent with a central assumption of resource-based view —that firms maximize value by choosing strategies that exploit their heterogeneous resources and individual situation (Mackey et al., 2017). fsQCA is a normative model of set-theoretic connections and is applied as an analytical tool in social sciences. Since several problems of social science can be formulated in terms of sets and set relations (Ragin, 2008), in which high values of a causal statement are not necessarily sufficient for high values of a dependent variable to occur (Woodside, 2013), the fsQCA method can identify these asymmetric relationships. It has been applied throughout management and innovation research to test set-theoretic relationships in social science models (Aversa et al., 2015; Brenes et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2013; Woodside, 2013). The set-theoretic method applied focuses on configurations of variables as sets in which cases have membership or not. The first step in this method is to calibrate our variable so that a franchisor is said to belong to a set (e.g. “high performing system”, “good mastery of KH”…) or not. The attribution of cases to sets is called calibration. Different methods of calibration exist. We use a simple method that rank orders the variable and then standardizes this ranking to range from 0 to 1. This method implicitly sets the “cross over point” at the median and fits well with the distribution or our variables. For example, looking at the performance variable (5 items, each measured on a scale from 1 to 7) the median, separating “high performing” system from “low performing” ones with our method, is 5.7. This is more than the middle of our scale (i.e. 4 which indicates stagnation), but this minimum level is consistent in defining “high performing systems”Once subsets have been defined, we can turn to hypotheses testing. We can think of necessary and sufficient conditions as subset relations. For example, H1 states that those systems that are performing well is a subset of those systems which have a business KH of value or a good mastery of organizational KH. Large-N applications integrate probabilistic elements to capture the degree to which a majority of cases correspond to the statement that X is a superset of Y (quasi-necessity; X ≥ Y), or a subset of Y (quasi-sufficiency; X ≤ Y) (Ragin, 2000). The analysis of necessity starts with identifying simple conditions that are a superset of (that is: necessary for) the outcome (here: high performing system). If no simple condition (here: mastery of a KH) proves necessary, further simple conditions can be added disjunctively until necessity is obtained (Thiem, 2014). We interpret those supersets as necessary conditions that make theoretical sense                                                  Only for the variable that refers to franchising rate a different choice could be (also) consistent. For this variable, the limit between systems with “high” franchising rate and low franchising rate amount to 80% with our method. This quite high level fits well with the definition of “turnkeys” and is consequently relevant. However, some professionals or academics may see it as quite high. Changing the calibration for this variable (and using the direct method (Ragin, 2008) with anchors at 30% (minimum threshold), 70% (crossover point) and 90% (maximum threshold) does not alter our results.against the background of our hypotheses, and meet the criteria outlined below (see Schneider and Wagemann, 2012). For the analysis of sufficiency, a “truth table” is constructed. The rows of the truth table indicate all possible combinations. This enables us to attribute the cases accordingly to the truth table and identify empirically unobserved configurations (so-called logical remainders). If all or enough cases’ fuzzy set-membership in a truth table row is smaller than or equal to its membership in the outcome, then the row is identified as a sufficient configuration for the outcome. The logical minimization process then identifies the shortest possible expression depicting the configurations that imply the outcome— the solution term. This is a straightforward procedure that relies on a basic set theory: for example, A*B*C + A*B*~C (the tilde means “not”) can be reduced to A*B (Thomann et al., 2018). To evaluate our results, we use consistency and coverage measures. The values of these fit indices can range from 0 (low) to 1 (high). Consistency is the extent to which the results are in line with the statements of necessity or sufficiency. For sufficient conditions, consistency is indicated for single truth table rows (raw consistency), for single configurations of, or for the whole solution term. We ensure that a given configuration is not simultaneously sufficient for both the occurrence and the nonoccurrence of the outcome. Coverage sufficiency depicts how well the model explains the available empirical information. Raw coverage expresses how much a single configuration covers, and unique coverage indicates how much it uniquely covers. Low coverage means that the model has a limited capacity to explain the outcome. For necessary conditions, coverage expresses their relevance in terms of the condition set not                                                  This possibility is provided directly in the « fuzzy » command of STATA software. It is similar to the use of PRI (proportional reduction in inconsistency) in other study (e.g. Thomann et al., 2018).being much larger than the outcome set, and the relevance of necessity (RoN) in terms of the condition being close to a constant (all formulae in Schneider and Wagemann 2012, p. 128, 139, 235–239). RESULTS Know-how as necessary conditions to high performance To evaluate our results, we use consistency and coverage measures. The values of these fit indices can range from 0 (low) to 1 (high). Consistency expresses the extent to which the results are in line with the statements of necessity, i.e. the degree to which observations correspond to set relation. A high level of consistency is necessary to assess the statement of necessity. Following Thomann et al. (2018), we retained a level of 0.9. For necessary conditions, coverage expresses their relevance in terms of the condition set not being much larger than the outcome set. If the set of networks with high know how was much bigger than the set of performing networks (which corresponds to a low coverage), then it would be very likely that KH is a necessary conditions to performance and the relevance of this condition would be weakened. Therefore, we must check that the coverage is not too low. Thomann et al. (2018) used a minimum coverage threshold of 0.6. Another information is important to assess the relevance of the KH as necessary conditions: the relation in size between the sets of “high” KH networks and the set of “low” KH networks. If the set of networks with high level of KH is much bigger than those with low level of KH, then it is very easy for networks with high level of KH to be a superset of whatever the outcome set consists of. We check this by computing the relevance of necessity (RoN) (see Schneider and Wagemann, 2012), and by plotting high performing systems vs systems with high level of KH, showing that neither are skewed toward high membership (Figure 2).  The level of consistency of 0.9 is attained for the set of the three KH (cohesion and/or control KH at the organizational level, or business KH) (Table 3). The coverage ratio (0.668) is not too low, and the relevance of necessity (equals to 1 its maximum) or the graphs (see Figure 2) show no skewness in the distributions, which confirm that this condition of necessity is relevant. Figure 2. Plots of the membership in the outcome (“highly performing systems”) and the membership in the different configurations of mastering of KH Legend: These graphs show that there is not sharp skewness in the distribution of KH toward high membership, whatever the membership in high performing systems, which supports the relevance of the condition of necessity regarding these KH. Table 3. Analyses of necessity Conditions Consistency Coverage Relevance of Necessity Good mastering of (cohesion or control or business) KH:  (COHE + CONT + BUSI) 0.901 0.668 Good mastering of (control or business) KH:  (CONT + BUSI) 0.854 0.685 Good mastering of (cohesion or business) KH (COHE + BUSI) 0.868 0.695 Good mastering of (control or cohesion) KH (CONT + COHE) 0.823 0.685 H1 is thus corroborated: the set of the three KH (cohesion, control, business) constitutes a necessary condition to high performance. Further, the results show that the set has to include these three KH to reach the consistency threshold. The three KH taken altogether constitute a minimum set that assesses the statement of necessity in relation to performance in franchise systems.  Capabilities as quasi-sufficient conditions to high performance We also used consistency and coverage measures to evaluate sufficiency. For sufficient conditions, consistency is indicated for single truth table rows (raw consistency), for single configurations or for the whole solution term. There is no fixed anchor to set the raw consistency threshold, but 0.75 is considered a minimum (Schneider and Wagemann, 2012; Thomann et al., 2018). We set a first threshold above this minimum, at 0.85 and also run our model with a threshold at 0.80. Coverage sufficiency depicts how well the model explains the available empirical information. Raw coverage expresses how much a single configuration covers, and unique coverage indicates how much it uniquely covers. Low coverage means that the model has a limited capacity to explain the outcome. The results can be presented in three modes or solution types. The “complexity” or “conservative” solution considers that all high performing configurations, which are not (or too weakly) present in our data (the so-called “logical remainders”), should not be taken in the set of high performing configurations before the minimization process. At the opposite, the “parsimonious” solution considers that all the high performing configurations, whether they are actually in our data or not, have to be taken in the minimization process. The “intermediate” solution is in between these two modes. In this mode, the researcher chooses which “logical remainder” configurations are theoretically non-problematic and plausible, and only those logical remainders enter the final (reduced) solution. Most prior work considered that the intermediate solution was superior to the two other solution types (Schneider and Wagemann, 2012; Thiem, 2019). But as Baumgartner and Thiem (2017) have shown, the conservative (or complexity) solution and the intermediate solution frequently committed causal fallacies of varying magnitude by presenting inferences that violated the very causal structure QCA was supposed to recover from a set of data. The parsimonious solution type is not affected by these causal fallacies. Thiem (2019) explained this counterintuitive result, and showed how the incriminated (conservative and intermediate) solutions supplement empirical data with matching artificial data. Considering this result, and considering that our “logical remainders” do not present a priori any problem from a theoretical point of view, we choose to present the parsimonious solution types. H2 states that a good mastering of control KH is a quasi-sufficient condition in a context of high franchising rate (or “turnkey systems”). In other words, some high performing configurations should exhibit the conjunctions of a good mastering of control KH when the franchising rate is high.  19 solutions entered as true and 16 solutions treated as do not cares (dnt). The solution considered as true or dnt (i.e retained as high performing) before the reduction process must simultaneously: i) Show a consistency level in relation to performance significantly higher (at the 10% confidence level) than 0.85 and ii) a consistency level in relation to performance that is significantly higher (at the same confidence level) than the consistency for low performance. Table 4. Parsimonious solution of high performance model A black circle represents the presence of a condition, a white circle represents the absence of a condition, and an empty cell indicates an irrelevant condition. In Table 4, the parsimonious solution shows only 4 configurations, which lead to high performance. Overall this solution shows a high consistency, and a coverage of 0.612, which indicates that these solutions cover more than 60% of the high performing configurations. Only configuration 1 includes a high franchising rate as one of its conditions. All other high performing configurations include « Not having a high franchising rate » as an INUS condition to performance. The high performing configuration with high franchising rate also includes a good mastering of control. This Configurations Overall : Coverage 0.612 Solution consistency 0.883 Franchising rate  (FRAN) Control KH (CONT)  Cohesion KH (COHE) Business KH (BUSI) Adaptive CD (ADAP) Sensing CD (SENS) Coverage (uniq) 0.106 0.091 0.018 0.035 Coverage (raw) 0.356 0.429 0.318 0.303 Solution consistency 0.905 1.000 0.887 0.879 supports H2: the control is a quasi-sufficient (INUS) condition of high performance when the franchising rate is high. To achieve a high performance with high franchising rate, the franchisor must not only have a good mastering of control, but also have a good mastering of the other KH (cohesion, business) and some dynamic (adaptive) capabilities as well. The conditions for a system with a high franchising rate to be efficient are therefore very tight. Nevertheless, this configuration shows a significant unique coverage (0.106, the highest among the different high performing configurations), and a moderate raw coverage (0.356). We can conclude that achieving high performance with a high franchising rate necessitates more than just mastering control in the system. But these demanding conditions are met by a significant number of franchisors among the high performing ones.  H2 receives some support, but the supports for H3 are more mixed. H3 states that sensing or adaptive DC are, in conjunction with KH, INUS conditions to high performance. We should observe the conjunction of adaptive or sensing DC with at least one KH in the high performing systems. Actually, only configuration 1 offers a clear support to H3. In this configuration, not only the franchisor has to master the main KH, but he/she must also possess dynamic adaptive capabilities. In other high performing configurations —which all include a “low” franchising rate— the mastering of a KH (configurations 2 and 3, business KH) is not necessarily associated with having DC. In configuration 2 an INUS condition of high performance is, on the contrary, NOT to develop adaptive capabilities. In configuration 3, developing DC is irrelevant. The configuration 4 includes the adaptive capabilities as an INUS condition, but this is not associated with a condition regarding the mastering of KH. In this configuration, the mastering of KH is irrelevant (business, control KH), or the system must NOT invest in mastering a KH (cohesion). Table 5 crosses the sets of hypothesized and not hypothesized configurations, with the set of detected solutions (also in Table 4) and not detected (all other possible configurations). H3 is stated as (CONT + COHE + BUSI) * (ADAP + SENS)  PERF (for the computation of intersection between the different (theorized and detected) solutions, see Schneider and Wagemann (2012, p. 301)). Table 5 shows how the results behave with respect to H3. The upper left quadrant shows those configurations that were both hypothesized and observed as high performing (with a set-membership > 0.5). The lower left quadrant displays those configurations that were not expected, but observed empirically, revealing additional explanations for high performance. The upper right quadrant refers to configurations that were expected but not observed in the solution. The lower right quadrant displays those configurations that are neither hypothesized nor covered by the solution. The upper left quadrant crosses our hypothesized results with the detected solution. It indicates that adaptive DC can, in conjunction with KH, be INUS conditions of performance. Adaptive capabilities can lead to performance when franchising rate is high, associated with a good mastering of the 3 know how (solution: ADAP * (F * CONT * COHE * BUSI)). We recognize here the configuration 1. Less obvious because it doesn’t appear as such in the detected solutions but still consistent with these solutions: adaptive capabilities can also be present in high performing configurations with a low franchising rate. In that case, it must be associated with a good mastering of control and business KH, but a not a high level of cohesion KH (solution: F * COHE * (CONT + BUSI)). Finally, sensing capabilities can also incorporate performing configuration, but only in contexts with low franchising rate, a strong business KH, but no mastering in adaptive dynamic capability and cohesion KH (solution SENS * (BUSI * F * ADAP + COHE)). These results emphasize the importance of the business KH in these high performing configurations. Based on Schneider and Wagemann (2012, p. 302), in each quadrant we indicated the consistency and coverage scores of the solutions as sufficient conditions for performance (PERF) and nonperformance (PERF) respectively. In this upper left quadrant, the solutions are still highly consistent with the statement of sufficiency (consistency of 0.885) regarding performance, further they show a coverage (0.567) that is close to the coverage of all the parsimonious solution (0.612). A little more than 56% of the performing configurations are predicted by theory (H3) and covered by empirics. These figures offer some support to H3, and we conclude that DC are INUS conditions to performance, but only in relationship with other (also INUS) conditions. In other words, the DC and KH interact to deliver performance (H3) only in some specific contexts.  The upper right quadrant pictures configurations hypothesized but not detected in solutions. Much (6) of these configurations include sensing capabilities. Sensing capabilities are less than expected in the recipes for success. Two configurations also include adaptive capabilities associated with cohesion KH in this quadrant.   The lower left quadrant is where empirical findings overlap with those cases not expected by theory. These cases refer (at least partially) to configurations 2 and 4 in Table 4. Indeed, contrary to H3, under specific circumstances, some configurations deliver high performance based only on the business KH or on adaptive DC and without any interaction between KH and DC. Hence, having a business KH of value, associated with low franchising rate, weak DC and cohesion KH (whatever the mastering of control KH) lead to high performance. As noted by Schneider and Wagemann (2012, p. 302), these configurations (not hypothesized but present in empirical findings) identify cases that suggest the direction in which theoretical expectations should be extended. However, this holds only for cases that also lead to high performance. From this respect, we notice that the coverage of these solutions in relation to high performance is quite weak (0.363). Hence, they cover quite few of the high performing configurations. Further, we already offered some explanations to these cases. Our theoretical framework portrays configurations where KH are present but DC absent as possible but not sustainable regarding high performance (on the long term) (solution: ADAP * SENS * F * BUSI *COHE). We also mentioned that, in our framework, configurations based on DC but that do not associate at least one of the KH may appear. These DC might then apply to other KH, not included on our study. Here, a configuration show that adaptive capability can lead to performance under the condition that the franchisor do not develop any of the KH included in this study (solution: CONT * BUSI * COHE * ADAP), although these KH can be considered as necessary condition to performance. This may indicate that, in some cases, adaptive capabilities apply to KH other than control, cohesion or business KH to deliver performance. But as indicated by the low level of coverage of this solution, these cases remain rare. Finally, the lower right quadrant shows cases not expected by the theory and not detected in empirics as well. It refers to overlooked cases regarding H3. These configurations exhibit no DC at all, or they may include sensing DC but no mastering of any KH. The fact that the configurations in this quadrant that lead to high performance exhibit a quite high coverage (0.591) and a high consistency (1) simply indicates that H3 and the solutions detected in Table 4 do not cover all the high performing systems. But H3 does not pretend to be a general theory of high performing systems, it rather intends to offer a partial explanation deduced from a more general theory. Table 5.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In this study, we characterized two franchisor’s organizational KH -control, cohesion- and local KH as a set of conditions necessary for high performance in franchise systems. However, this result should not be misinterpreted. It states that a study that would take into account only one of these KH to explain performance, contingently or not, would explain the performance of only one part of the systems. But this result is not exclusive of other approaches or outcomes; in particular, it does not rule out the possibility that other conditions, including sets of other KH, may also form sets of conditions necessary for high performance. Above all, our analysis leads us to distinguish between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for high performance in franchise systems. While the KH taken into account in this study do indeed together constitute necessary conditions, they can only constitute sufficient conditions in association with other conditions. In this light, our analysis leads us to predict that, in combination with a high franchising rate, control KH should be a sufficient condition of high performance. Our results support this prediction. Simultaneously, they show that additional conditions are required, and that the configurations concerned represent at best a little more than 35% of the configurations that lead to high performance. We also predict that KH should lead to high performance in association with DC. Our results show that this is the case for a significant proportion of the high performing configurations. Nevertheless, they also show that certain DC can in certain contexts, even in the absence of the KH retained in this study, lead to high performance. We interpret this result as an indication that the KH retained in this study, although identified together as a necessary condition for high performance, are not the only KH to which DC apply. We also observe configurations where DC are absent (or without incidence), and certain KH, alone or in combination, lead to high performance. Our results confirm that business KH is a cornerstone of high performance, but not systematically and independently of other conditions.   Above all, our results inform about the nature, but also the diversity and complexity of the \"franchise management capabilities\" that lead to high performance (Gillis et al., 2020). Through the lens of franchise management capabilities, our results complement (and in fact depart from) those of Gillis et al. (2020). Indeed, they show that the package of dynamic KH and capabilities that lead to high performance is not the same depending on the franchise ownership strategy (plural form vs turnkey franchisor). For turnkey franchisors, who franchise all, or almost all, the franchise management capabilities that lead to high performance combine control knowledge, cohesion and DC for adaptation. Thus, the franchise management capabilities that lead to success do not only lie in the control of the franchisees, it is also necessary to gain their adhesion and to develop adaptive capabilities. The configuration approach therefore allows us to define a set of precise conditions that lead to high performance. The lack of a link between franchise management capabilities and performance observed by Gillis et al. (2020) concerning turnkey systems may be due to their linear approach and their measurements, either aggregated or separate, of the different components of the franchise management capabilities that do not allow highlighting these conditions. Our results for plural form systems contrast sharply with those of turnkey systems and are a priori less informative: franchise management capabilities either do not appear in the high-performance configurations or under a condition of absence (only business KH then appears positively), or only dynamic adaptation capabilities appear. Further studies are required to determine which (other) capabilities are to be considered in defining the conditions of high performance. However, our results already partially point the way. We show that control, cohesion and business KH are the necessary conditions for high performance. It is therefore possible to start from these conditions, and to think about other conditions, linked to capabilities or to the context of the franchise systems, which enable to define the conditions of high performance more precisely. This study’s results contain three limitations that should guide future research. First, the cross-sectional design of this study allowed to address the issue of complex interdependencies among dynamic capabilities, know-how and franchise ownership conditions but it did not allow us to examine these complex interdependencies over time. We measured the constructs at one point in time. However, the integration of time is important if not crucial in the study of dynamic capabilities (Ambrosini and Bowman, 2009). This complex and dynamic area of research requires rich and diverse research methods (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) to increase our understanding of dynamic capabilities within franchise systems and provide more insights into their practice. In particular, longitudinal studies should be undertaken to explore the long-term effects of dynamic capabilities. A longitudinal study design may then depict the dynamics of change in dynamic capabilities. Second, we used self-reported data. Although efforts were made to ensure data quality, the potential of survey biases cannot be excluded.  The respondents’ perceptions might not coincide with objective reality. Third, the sample was drawn from across several sectors, which increases the scope of our results; however, significant differences may be hidden.

Abstract Australia’s policy makers have worked since 1993 to curb unconscionable conduct in franchise relationships. One area that remains unyielding is franchise marketing funds. Franchise relationships are primarily regulated by contracts. The contracts are drafted to benefit franchisors, and in many relationships, franchisees are required make payments to marketing funds, controlled by franchisors. The franchisee’s understanding when making these payments is that the funds will be used for the benefit of their own franchise. However, the failure to require franchisors to hold marketing funds in trust and has seen their being used to boost franchisors’ profits and even fund a franchisor’s racing car. For a range of reasons, franchisors resist recommendations to protect marketing funds by requiring they be held in trust. Recently, the Australian government’s Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme has gained access to marketing funds to pay an insolvent franchisor’s employees. This article provides evidence of the scale of opportunism concerning marketing funds, identifies the current laws that stall effective regulation of these funds, and proposes solutions. Key words: contract, consumer protection, insolvency law, franchise marketing funds Franchise marketing funds and the law: the unscrupulous franchisor’s piggy bank.  Introduction Navigating ‘conflicts [of interest] is the primary challenge’ of franchising. The nature and content of franchise agreements facilitate ‘[a]n unrestricted exercise of control by the franchisor [that] will favour the franchisor’s interests over the franchisee’s and create an equally significant problem for the franchisee: the risk of opportunism’.  Potentially intractable conflicts of interest, are cemented into the franchise contract. They capitalise on franchisee over-optimism and enable franchisors to behave unconscionably.   The franchise marketing fund is particularly problematic. Answers to questions like who contributes to it, how and when funds are spent, what they are spent on, how the expenditure is accounted for and who makes the brand’s marketing decisions should be transparent. Often this is not the case. One justification may be that ‘[i]n some circumstances a franchisor’s decision to require increased advertising by franchisees … will reflect a legitimate exercise of franchisor control to overcome free-riding. But in other circumstances, it will reflect only opportunism’.Imagine being Mr and Mrs Scaf, a franchisee of the now failed Aussie Farmers Direct (AFD), who claimed, in relation to use of AFD’s $789,391 marketing fund: (1) AFD marketing tools which we were promised when we purchased the franchise (but which were never outlined in our Franchise Agreement) were simply removed at will ... (2) … The Franchise Agreement was limited in its content .... The Franchisor themselves had no obligations around … the website customers ordered through or the marketing tools they chose to use our funds on.

(3) Our marketing fund statements were impossible to make sense of …, if we even saw the statement at all.The AFD franchisee touches on the challenges posed by franchise agreements that document a relationship where ‘the [intellectual] property rights of the franchisor are often a primary interest of the contract’. It also highlights the failure of Australia’s legislation, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (‘CCA’), the Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’), the Franchising Code of Conduct (‘the Code’) and to a lesser extent the ASIC Act (because it applies to fewer franchise offerings) to prevent opportunistic misuse of marketing fund by franchisors. The CCA, ACL and the Code are administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (‘ACCC’) and the ASIC Act is administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’).  It is not just AFD that revealed weakness in contract and consumer protection law. Franchisees in the Croissant Express franchise submitted to the 2018 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, InquiryPJC’):  $420,000.00 [was] taken for the Point of Sale [POS] system when it is supposed to be used to market our businesses - no marketing of any significance done except in store posters to existing customers. … Requests for the financials that make up the Audits - declined  We approached the ACCC and found the franchisor to be deceptive to the ACCC - told them that the POS was actually a marketing tool with [the franchisor] suppling [products and programs] all of which we never received however; the marketing fund had paid for. This is a Point of Sale, and not a marketing tool, as they claim.

Kyle Hudspeth, PJC submission 34; Dean Stewart PJC submission 145. As David Lewellyn writes, ‘a moral hazard may emerge whereby consumers perceive there to be an “implicit contract” between themselves and the regulatory agency’. The Croissant Express submission suggests that the franchisee believed the ACCC as regulator would not accept the franchisor’s explanation. That optimism was misplaced. The Scafs’ AFD submission also hints at problems looming for AFD in another area of law, insolvency.  The financial auditors statement that Franchisors can get away with including currently is insufficient and even misleading – after all, our Franchisor was still approving sales of franchises in 2018, signing the Duty of Disclosure document which stated they were able to pay their debts for the next twelve months, while simultaneously following a process to investigate insolvency optionsHere, again, the franchisees’ interest in the marketing fund were shown to be vulnerable, revealing a conflict of interest between the franchisor’s administrator and the government. The potential for this conflict had been foreshadowed in the Wein Review in the context of a conflict between the interests of the franchisor’s unsecured creditors, and its franchisees.The above examples are but three extracts from franchisee submissions to the 2018 Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Franchising Code of Conduct. These insights highlight one of the horrifying blind spots of regulation of the franchise relationship in Australia. In this paper the categorisation of franchise marketing funds is examined through the lenses of contract law, consumer protection policy and insolvency law. Franchisors’ objections to a suggestion that they hold marketing funds in trust is challenged. How courts have resolved conflicts of interest concerning franchise marketing funds is addressed and solutions are proposed.

Alan Wein, Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, 30 April 2013.  The purpose of marketing funds in a franchised business Brand reputation and goodwill is at the core of the franchise business model. Central to the development of any brand is the way its products/ services are advertised and perceived by consumers. An effective and memorable advertising campaign has the ability to bolster a brand’s reputation and stay with consumers long-after the commercials have stopped airing or the newspapers have been thrown out. One example, the McDonald’s ‘I’m lovin’ it’ slogan has cemented its place in popular culture references since the 2006.  As Madden surmises ‘the use of, and association with, a trademark, in conjunction with a specific and confidential business methodology, is what gives a franchise system its value.’It is unsurprising then that almost all franchisors require franchisees to make payments into central marketing funds that are intended to be used for the purposes of enhancing and building the franchise’s reputation. The basis behind such an approach is that franchisees can pool their resources, leverage the economies of scale, and create campaigns that will be of benefit for the whole system.   In franchise networks, roles are allocated between the franchisor and its franchisees. It typically falls to the franchisor to collect, administer the marketing fund and to make the marketing decisions. The franchisees must implement them. Contract, consumer protection and insolvency The franchise agreement, as the primary regulatory instrument in a franchise relationship, sets out the franchisor’s marketing funds obligations. As franchise agreements are typically offered on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis, the franchisee is contractually incapable of curbing franchisor  Madden, L. S. (2019). Not Your Mama's Advertising Fund: Best Practices in the Use of Franchise System Advertising Funds. Franchise Law Journal(3), 379-399. opportunism in relation to how the funds will be spent. This can be attributed to historical ways of viewing a contract.  Classical contract doctrine claims to look only to the “four corners of the document” in identifying the content of the contractual relationship between the parties. Doing so in the franchise context would define a relationship almost exclusively in terms of the franchisor’s interest in protecting its trademark and the broad range of control that it assumes to pursue that interest. As Stewart Macauley has documented, however the real life of the franchise is found not in the contract but in its operationIn a franchise relationship, much of the operational guidance is documented in operating manuals which remain unregulated and can be changed at will by franchisors. This flexibility is necessary as it enables franchise systems to adapt to changing trading environments, but it creates an opportunity for franchisor opportunism. Most franchise relationships are intended to last for many years and are expected to adapt as markets evolve. To expect a static document to cater for all future contingencies is unrealistic. In franchising ‘[t]he contract supplies starting points: the frequency of payments, … and advertising responsibilities. It also supplies boundaries’. Beyond and within the boundaries the franchise agreement is incomplete. As Hadfield observed, ‘… the incompleteness … consists in either the absence or the intense ambiguity of these starting points and boundaries: [for example] How expensive can promotions be?’ For Hadfield, ‘franchisor and franchisee enter into a “franchise relationship” in reliance on commonly understood features of that relationship which fill in the gaps of the written contract and create an understanding of the full range of commitments involved’. The franchisor, being the repeat player, is always in the stronger position. As Issacharof notes,  ‘the relation between a repeat-play mass firm and individual consumers is more likely to give rise to disparities in bargaining power, and to opportunism on  Hadfield, 956 and 957.  Hadfield, 957  Hadfield, 957  Hadfield, 957 the part of the repeat player’. The use, or misuse, of marketing funds is a prime example of this opportunism within the franchise relationship.  On executing the franchise agreement, a franchisee allocates control over the marketing fund to the franchisor. As Hadfield has noted, ‘Franchisors can abuse the relationship most directly through the manipulation of the price or quantity of products or services sold to the franchisee’. These services can include items like researching and preparing marketing programs. She continues that  Observers note that it is “tempting for franchise companies to use these advertising dollars to boost their profit margins”. Many franchisees complain that “they do not receive advertising support commensurate with their payment of advertising fees”A second problem is protection of franchisees as business consumers. ‘… although franchising arrangements have traditionally been creatures of contract, they have become increasingly regulated.’ Pre contract disclosure, dispute resolution and some other aspects of franchise regulation are implemented in recognition that ‘consumer protection is a necessary part of a functioning market and the government has some responsibility to act when markets fail.’Instances of franchisors misleading or behaving unconscionably in relation to marketing funds are recounted in Parliamentary inquiries and complaints to the ACCC. They identify franchisors’ failure to adhere to the CCA and/ or the Code, and abuse of the franchise marketing funds by franchisors. Llewellyn suggests that their belief in regulatory protection may cause some people to underestimate the risks around their consumption of particular 18 Samuel Issacharof,  ‘Disclosure, Agents, and Consumer Protection’ Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics(167) 1, 28th International Seminar on the New Institutional Economics — Business-to-Consumer Transactions (March 2011), pp. 56-71 Hadfield, 967.

Leigh Anderson, Muel Kiel, ‘Consumer Protection Models and Theories’, Evans Policy Analysis Report Technical Report #387, April 4, 2019 accessed at https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/epar_uw_387_consumer-protection-20190404_0.pdf goods, and services, especially financial products’. As shown by Benoliel et al, many franchisees are unrealistically over-optimistic.The third challenge facing franchisees arises if their franchisor becomes insolvent. Franchisees are not recognised under the Corporations Act as stakeholders with rights in the franchisor’s insolvency. Franchisees have invested significant sunk costs in their business, which cannot be recovered from an insolvent franchisor. The franchisees do not see the insolvency coming in the same way as unpaid employees or late-paid trade creditors may do, so they have rarely taken any proactive action to protect their rights and assets.  Let us now turn to explore how the franchisees’ rights to do anything beyond paying money into the franchisor’s marketing fund plays out in the context of contract law, consumer protection and insolvency policy.  Contract law Hadfield noted that ‘… franchise relationships are too complex to reduce to precise statutory terms, [so] the heart of franchising’s legal structure is still contract’. She observed that ‘… the traditional function of contract law is to enforce the private commitments reached by contracting parties in structuring their exchanges’. She further noted that ‘[t]he duty to avoid defeating the reasonable expectations of one’s contracting partners is another possible fairness justification for contract rules that control free-riding and opportunism’.  Alongside the idea of the parties’ private commitments needing to be respected is the reality that ‘[i]nequality of bargaining power exists in most areas of consumer transactions,particularly in complex products such as financial service transactions where standard-term contracts are the norm and Llewellyn, D.T. (1995). ‘Consumer protection in retail investment services: Protection against what?’ Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance 3(1), 43-54 at 52. https://doi.org/10.1108/eb024826. Cited in C.

Hadfield, 939.  Hadfield, 954- 955.   Hadfield, 953. are encouraged by the development of large enterprises involved in mass marketing’. The same could be said of franchise agreements.  The disadvantages of standard-form contracts have been summarised by Professor Hondius as follows:  a)  A consumer will usually not review standard contract terms …; b)  The length and typography of the full text of general conditions does not invite a consumer to read the small print; c)  A consumer will often not grasp the full meaning of the text of general conditions; d)  If the consumer grasps the full meaning of the text of general conditions, they may believe that the event mentioned with will not take place, nor will the supplier invoke the terms in particular cases; e)  A consumer may be under the false impression that the contract terms have been officially endorsed or are in compliance with the law; and f)  A consumer will generally not succeed in altering the contract terms nor will the agent or employee of the supplier have the authority to do so.Examples of Hondius’ observations abound in franchise relationships. Regulators lament that many franchisees do not read their contracts. They trust the franchisor. According to American franchise lawyer Richard Solomon:  The materials provided for you have the “look” of authenticity. The language used is the same for the really bona fide business investment opportunity as it is for the fraudulent opportunity. In both you see references to belonging to a family. You see promises of “support”. You see reassurances of “proven systems”. You see representations of economic power, as in the instance of group purchasing. These are probably all the positive attributes of organizations with which you have previously been affiliated, and they make you feel comfortableThe length of a package of franchise documents including disclosure can easily reach 300 pages. The prospective franchisee’s eyes will glaze over early in the read. Much of the language is unfamiliar legalese and as Richard Solomon poignantly acknowledged ‘Just as you would not have stood up in a meeting in your previous employment and demanded of the chief  UNCTAD, Consumer Policy Manual, 2008.UNCTAD, Consumer Policy Manual, 2008. Richard Solomon, What You Learned In “Charm School” Will Not Work in Franchise Investment Due Diligence, post in Bluemaumau.org, December 27th, 2007. executive that he prove the truth of what he has stated, you wouldn’t think of doing so here.’Compounding this, as already noted, franchisees are optimistically biased.  As Thomas J observed in Bobox the New Zealand case concerning a supplier and a distributor, ‘[t]he sheer commercial absurdity of this lopsided bargain prompts the question as to how it could have come about’. Similarly in franchising, the one-sided nature of the franchise agreement means that the vast majority of obligations and commitments are made by the franchisee, including the obligation to contribute to the franchise marketing fund. Few franchisors will specifically outline firm obligations with regard to the nature, extent, and quality of advertising or the ways in which the marketing fund will be used. While the roles and responsibilities of each party are laid out in the franchise agreement, the very nature of a long-term agreement (anywhere from five to twenty years) means that it is near impossible to contractually encompass the idiosyncrasies of the future relationship within the confines of the original agreement. As such, franchise agreements are, by necessity, left vague and open to interpretation. As Hadfield identifies:  Rather than spelling out every decision ex ante, [the franchise contract] designs a decision-making structure and assigns to the franchisor responsibility for responding to market conditions … and to the franchisee responsibility for complianceBy way of example, in the context of marketing funds, Re Stay In Bed Milk & Bread Pty Ltd (In Liq) (‘Stay In Bed’) Randall AsJ acknowledged ‘[t]he Franchise Agreement is silent on what happens with the Marketing Fund in the event that SIBMB stops trading’. In this example, the Stay In Bed Milk & Bread (SIBMB) franchisee  was required to make payments into the marketing levy amounting to 5% of Gross Delivery Fees plus GST. In  Richard Solomon, What You Learned In “Charm School” Will Not Work in Franchise Investment Due Diligence, post in Bluemaumau.org, December 27th, 2007.

To illustrate this, the franchisees from 123 Michel’s Patisserie locations agree to contribute ‘the greater of 3% of their gross sales or $200 per week (plus GST)’ to the fund, plus an initial marketing activity fee of $3,000. They also acknowledge that the franchisor may elect to contribute, with no obligation. The fund, estimated at accumulating funds at the rate of $1,407,120 per annum (including GST) plus the sums of $3,000 for each new franchisee, is controlled by the franchisor. According to the franchise agreement, the scope of activities that the money can be spent on includes, but is not limited to: (a)  research and development of or in relation to the Intellectual Property (including, but not limited to, the Franchisor’s Business Name, the Names and Marks, the System, the [franchise brand’s] Image and the Products);  (b)  research, development, identification, assessment, evaluation and or analysis of products (including the Products), goods and or services marketed or used, or to be marketed or used, by the Franchisor or its Affiliates and or offered or to be offered, or proposed to be offered, for sale from [franchise brand’s] Shops or by [franchise brand] franchisees, regardless of whether those products, goods or services are ultimately used commercially or otherwise, together with the supply or distribution, or proposed supply or distribution, of the same amongst the network of [franchise brand] Shops or [franchise brand] franchisees;   Franchise agreement clause 4.1(c).

The language used favours the franchisor and their rights above those of the franchisees. Specifically, in sub clause (d) above the needs and wants of the franchisee are ranked fifth, not only behind those of the franchisor, but also the brand’s affiliates and external stakeholders.  Other terms used throughout this section of the franchise agreement, that should send alarm bells to prospective franchisees, courts  and the regulator, include ‘franchisor’s absolute discretion’and ‘as determined by the Franchisor, in any medium whatsoever’. It is abundantly clear that franchisees have little, if any, say into how the marketing fund is to be spent in this franchise, nor is it certain that the money will be or has to be used to the franchisees benefit. Furthermore, the fund is audited annually by one of Australia’s largest accounting firms, but the audit report provided as part of the disclosure combines all six of the parent company’s franchised brands together, so that no franchisee is provided with information that is unique to their franchise nor an overview of how the fund was used to the benefit of their business. Statutory consumer protection According to the United Nations,  Consumer protection addresses disparities found in the consumer-supplier relationship, which include bargaining power, knowledge, and resources. State intervention is premised to provide consumer protection on a number of grounds, including economic efficiency.Australian law provides notional consumer protection for franchisees through legislation that sanctions unconscionable conduct, misleading and deceptive conduct, unfair contract terms and breaches of the Franchising Code of Conduct, the CCA and its Australian Consumer Law (‘ACL’) Volume. Accessing that protection can be prohibitively expensive, slow, risky and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Manual on Consumer Protection, (2016) 15.daunting for franchisees. To many people reading through the above excerpt on marketing funds from the Michel’s Patisserie franchise agreement, it would be clear that this section of the agreement suggests the franchisor engaging in unconscionable or misleading and deceptive or false conduct. The terms have the capacity to become unfair contract terms depending on the business practices of the franchisor. Misleading, deceptive, false or unconscionable conduct Sections 18, 21, 29 and 37 of the ACL prohibit parties from engaging in conduct that is misleading, deceptive, false and or unconscionable. There have been a number of recent actions by the regulator (the ACCC) against franchisors for behaving in a way that breaches these sections of ACL.  Specific cases include Ultra Tune and, most recently, the Retail Good Group (RFG). Proceedings inthe latterwere filed in the Federal Court of Australia on 15 December 2020 alleging that RFG, as the listed holding company of the companies that operate several food-related franchised brands, had falsely misled franchisees in breach of ss 37(2), 29(1)(g) and 18(1) of the ACL and clause 6 of the Code. These breaches added up to RFG acting unconscionably in breach of s 21(1) of the ACL and s 51ACB of the CCA. A key focus of the litigation is the use (or misuse) of marketing funds.  The current regulatory requirements Following the Wein Review in 2013 the then Minister for Small Business, Bruce Bilson, announced that through amendments to the Code the Government would:  Introduce greater transparency for the way in which marketing funds are used and accounted for. This will include requiring additional disclosure on the types of expenses marketing funds are being used for;  giving franchisees the option to vote for an annual audit of the marketing fund; and  requiring franchisors to keep marketing funds in a separate account to the rest of their moniesAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12  The Hon Bruce Bilson, Minister for Small Business, The Future of Franchising, April 2014. This takes us to the current position where there are three requirements in the Code pertaining to marketing funds; Clauses 15 and 31 of the Code, and Item 15 of the Disclosure Document. They stipulate: Cl. 15: Copy of financial statements (1) If a franchise agreement provides that a franchisee must pay money to a marketing or other cooperative fund, the franchisor must: (a) within 4 months after the end of the last financial year, prepare an annual financial statement detailing all of the fund’s receipts and expenses for the last financial year; and (b) ensure that the statement includes sufficient detail of the fund’s receipts and expenses so as to give meaningful information about: (i) sources of income; and (ii) items of expenditure, particularly with respect to advertising and marketing expenditure; and (c) have the statement audited by a registered company auditor within 4 months after the end of the financial year to which it relates; and (d) give to the franchisee: (i) a copy of the statement, within 30 days of preparing the statement; and (ii) a copy of the auditor’s report, if such a report is required, within 30 days of preparing the report. Civil penalty: 300 penalty units [$54,000]. (2) A franchisor does not have to comply with paragraph (1)(c) in respect of a financial year if: (a) 75% of the franchisor’s franchisees in Australia, who contribute to the fund, have voted to agree that the franchisor does not have to comply with the paragraph in respect of the financial year; and (b) that agreement is made within 3 months after the end of the financial year. (3) If a franchise agreement provides that a franchisee must pay money to a marketing or other cooperative fund, the reasonable costs of administering and auditing the fund must be paid from the fund. Cl. 31 Marketing and advertising fees (1)  A franchisor must maintain a separate bank account for marketing fees and advertising fees contributed by franchisees. (2)  If a franchisor operates one or more units of a franchised business, the franchisor must pay marketing fees and advertising fees on behalf of each unit on the same basis as other franchisees. (3)  Despite any terms of a franchise agreement, marketing fees or advertising fees may only be used to:                      (a)  meet expenses that:  (i)  have been disclosed to franchisees under paragraph 15.1(f) of the disclosure document; or                              (ii)  are legitimate marketing or advertising expenses; or                             (iii)  have been agreed to by a majority of franchisees; or                      (b)  pay the reasonable costs of administering and auditing a marketing fund. Prior to signing a franchise agreement, a franchisor provides a disclosure document. Item 15 of the Disclosure Document requires the franchisor to provide information about its marketing or other cooperative funds that complies with the following: 15.1 For each marketing or other cooperative fund, controlled or administered by or for the franchisor, to which the franchisee may be required to contribute, the following details: (a)  the kinds of persons who contribute to the fund (for example, franchisee, franchisor, outside supplier); (b)  how much the franchisee must contribute to the fund and whether other franchisees must contribute at a different rate; (c)  who controls or administers the fund; (d)  whether the fund is audited and, if so, by whom and when; (e)  how the fund’s financial statements can be inspected by franchisees; (f)  the kinds of expense for which the fund may be used; (g)  the fund’s expenses for the last financial year, including the percentage spent on production, advertising, administration and other stated expenses; (h)  whether the franchisor or its associates supply goods or services for which the fund pays and, if so, details of the goods or services; (i)  whether the franchisor must spend part of the fund on marketing, advertising or promoting the franchisee’s business. Compliance with the above requirements should have been sufficient for franchise marketing funds to be operated for the purpose of marketing for the benefit of those whose contributions made up the fund. However, a number of franchise agreements, disclosure documents and submissions to the 2018 PJC inquiry revealed a different approach by some franchisors. The question raised here is how and why franchisors are able to skirt the law and get away with not complying with their disclosure requirements. The answer can be found in the most long-standing issue facing the franchise relationship, that of the inherent imbalance of power and control.  Insolvency law An entity becoming insolvent is a game-changer in terms of the applicable legislation and rights of stakeholders.  The usual laws of contract and consumer protection are replaced by the rights of creditors. In franchisor insolvency the franchisees are an externality and as a result, a range of different franchise stakeholders may be unjustly enriched by the marketing fund when remaining assets are distributed. This was demonstrated in an unexpected way in the Aussie Farmers Direct (AFD) example.   The franchisor’s liquidators. In theory a well-coordinated group of franchisees could make out a claim in quasi-contractagainst the administrator or liquidator, for unjust enrichment. This has not been tested in the context of insolvency in Australian courts. It depends firstly on the court granting consent to franchisees to embark on litigation against the administrator or liquidator or against the directors or solvent related entities of the failed franchisor.   An unjust enrichment action could be considered by franchisees that recently paid a franchise fee but derived very little benefit prior to the franchisor’s failure. The pool of money available to the liquidator to pay creditors is artificially expanded by both the franchise fee and the pool of funds in the franchisor-controlled marketing fund; thus, the liquidator is ‘unjustly enriched’. So, if liquidators and the franchisor’s secured and unsecured creditors and franchisor’s employees are benefitting from the money franchisees have paid into the marketing fund of an insolvent franchisor what can be done to address franchisees’ reasonable expectations? This is discussed in more detail later.Response of the courts According to Hadfield ‘[w]here the courts go astray … is in treating the franchisor’s interest as if it represented the entirety of the relation’. While several Australian franchise cases mention marketing funds, most are based on breach of contract claims; few concerned breaches of the marketing funds obligations in the Code.   Bruce Moore (ed), The Australian Oxford Dictionary ed, 2010) 479. ‘Quasi-contract (implied contract) a form of the equitable remedy of restitution to restore an innocent party to his previous position.’  Hadfield, 980. In 2007, Beech J denied a request for summary judgment in The Outdoor Furniture Specialists Pty Ltd v Liveris (TOFS). The franchisor plaintiff was joined in the action by its marketing company, TOFS Marketing Ltd. They claimed that  substantial disputes had arisen between the first plaintiff franchisor and the defendants. Among the matters in dispute were the applicable percentage rate to be applied to the calculation of marketing contributions and the question of the proper identification of the turnover to which such rate was to be applied.   An earlier mediation between the parties had resulted in them signing a Settlement Deed. It included the provision that 7.7 The Parties agree that the monies in the TOFS marketing fund for Perth will be reasonably expended during the currency of this Deed on advertising in and around Perth. Such expenditure will be in accordance with clause 15.10 of the O'Connor Franchise Agreement. However, they could not agree after that mediation how much money was involved. The franchisor asked a person at accounting firm PwC, Mr Vickers, to advise the correct sum.  He determined that an amount of $54,852.95 was payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs in respect of the marketing contributions for the period in questionWhat we can take from TOFS is that the application of moneys paid into the marketing fund by franchisees is of serious concern to franchisees, and that it may involves sizeable sums.  Although the next case is not about compliance with the Code either, it proved to be a taste of things to come for franchisors that are not explicit about how marketing funds are spent. BB Australia PtyLtd v Constanti was what Mukhtar AsJ described as ‘a quarrelsome appeal from a decision of the Magistrates’ Court concerning the payment of licence and marketing fees due by an ex-franchisee under a franchise agreement’ over the portion of the original claim that the magistrate had disallowed. In regard to the $16,168.62 sum of allegedly owing marketing fees, the court observed;    [2007] WASC 197  Para 21  [2017] VSC 114. the claim for unpaid licence fees and marketing fund contributions for $16,168.62 which the Magistrate disallowed was also the subject of a number of invoices which simply refer to marketing fee or ‘franchise-rental’ or ‘franchise-retail’ and a time period, state the amount due, and say no more. (71) the history of miscalculations elsewhere intensified the need to be satisfied that the calculations in the relevant invoices were proved to his Honour’s satisfaction.   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd[2019] FCA 12 Bromwich J considered the veracity of information provided to a range of franchisees operating Ultra Tune businesses in different states and different parts of those states.  72. For the 2014-15 and 2015-16 financial years, Ultra Tune was required by cl. 15 of the Franchising Code to prepare, have audited, and distribute certain annual financial statements if a franchisee was required to pay money into a marketing fund.   Having been satisfied that the franchisor (Ultra Tune) had not complied with its obligations the court considered the appropriate penalty 322. Specific deterrence looms large, as does general deterrence lest any other franchisor be tempted to conduct a franchise business in a like manner. Such conduct, by both Ultra Tune, and by others contemplating the same or similar behaviour, will only be likely to be deterred if the penalties imposed are large enough to ensure that this cannot be seen as a mere cost of doing business, or a chance worth taking, because of the greater returns to be made from franchisees, and prospective franchisees, who are not appropriately armed with the information they need to make sound business decisions, in entering into, and continuing franchise arrangements and in spending substantial sums of otherwise unchecked money on marketing funds.Quistclose trust In 2018, what Mr Wein had accepted was possible in 2014, came to pass.  Aussie Farmers Direct was Australia's first independent grocery delivery businesses to reach a national scale. They were pioneers in the grocery delivery space. Their mission resonated with millions, which lead to a strong community of people who wanted to bypass the supermarket duopoly and support Australian farmers. After 13 years of fighting the supermarket duopoly, the Aussie Farmers Direct business model ultimately became unsustainable and the company went into voluntary administration on March 6th, 2018Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd [2019] FCA 12  https://www.aussiefarmers.com.au/ The voluntary administration led to liquidation. The liquidators took the issue of who owned the marketing fund to court. Following a hearing on 18 September 2018, judgment was handed down 6 months later, on 22 March 2019. The case, In the matter of Stay in Bed Milk & Bread Pty Ltd (In Liq) [2019] VSC 181 the court heard arguments by the liquidator of the franchisor known as ‘Aussie Farmers Direct’(‘AFD’). The liquidator found itself in a tussle with the Commonwealth of Australia, represented by the Australian Government Department of Jobs and Small Business (‘the Department’). The Department administers the Fair Entitlements Guarantee (‘FEG’) schemethat was set up under the Fair Entitlement Guarantee Act 2012 (Cth) to replace the former General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS). The liquidators of AFD had to determine whether the marketing fund of $789,391 could be returned to the 91 franchisees that had paid into it, or whether the Commonwealth could access it to help make up a shortfall in the amount payable to franchisor, AFD’s 259 employees who were owed $4,263,654 in outstanding entitlements.  The liquidators argued that the marketing fund was held on trust for the franchisees, or, alternatively that a Quistclose trust was formed on the insolvency of the franchisor and that as a consequence, the money in the marketing fund should be returned to the franchisees. They lost. The Department argued that no trust had been created and that the money should be an asset of the franchisor and should be available to fund the shortfall of wages and entitlements owing to the employees and payable under the FEG. They won.  The court also ordered that the costs of both parties should be paid out of the marketing fund. Without knowing what those costs amounted to, we would suggest that they cut  The franchisor would also need to be included if it had contributed to the fund. significantly into the $789,391 that would otherwise have been able to be paid back to former franchisees.   The current Federal Court action against listed franchisor Retail Food Group (ASX:RFG) was filed in December 2020 as a result of evidence provided by franchisees to the 2018 PJC inquiry. RFG’s share price dropped 24% before a brief trading halt. Shares are now trading at 7.4 cents. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Retail Food Group Limited File number NSD1333/2020 the ACCC alleges that the franchisor made false and misleading claims about the profitability of corporate stores it sold to franchisees, made ‘improper payments from marketing fund accounts and failed to properly disclose marketing expenditures to franchisees,’ behaved unconscionably and with a lack of good faith. RFG has 10 brands including those specifically identified in the pleadings: Michel’s Patisserie, Brumby’s Bakery, Donut King and Gloria Jean’s. Six weeks later there is still no mention of the pending litigation on the RFG website so prospective franchisees who do not conduct extensive due diligence could be unaware of the case. Proposed solutions The Australian franchise sector has been the subject of numerous parliamentary reviews. These resulted in the introduction of a voluntary Code of Practice in 1993, followed in 1998 by a mandatory Code of Conduct and the expansion of the unconscionable conduct provisions of the CCA to cover business to business dealings. Minor tweaks were made to the 1998 Code following further reviews of franchising in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2018 and 2020. All identified the requirement that the franchisor provide marketing leadership in some form. https://hotcopper.com.au/asx/rfg/overview/ Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Retail Food Group Limited File number NSD1333/2020. Concise Statement 15 December 2020. https://www.rfg.com.au/shareholder-center/ viewed on 4 February 2021.  These reviews resulted in the following reports: ‘Opportunity not Opportunism’ (2008), the ‘Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct’ (2013), (the Wein Report), ‘Fairness in Franchising’ (2019).  Fitzgerald, R., ‘Franchising Code of Practice’ (1993, unpublished).  In the context of reform to the way marketing funds are managed, ‘[F]ranchisors have not been among those lobbying for change or regulation’. The opaqueness of franchise marketing funds and the consequential franchisor opportunism in relation to how these funds are accounted for to franchisees, and spent were strong, recurrent themes in the most recent review by the PJC ‘Fairness in Franchising’ Report (2019). Clearly, franchise marketing funds merit closer scrutiny. Some submissions identified that franchisors are avoiding obligations with respect to marketing by structuring their marketing and advertising fund so that it does not meet the definition of a fund as set out in the Code. It was suggested that marketing funds should be kept in a separate account, such as a trust account. Apart from the clarity and administrative benefits of a separate marketing and advertising fund, one submission indicated that it is possible such an approach may provide franchisees with an explicit proprietary claim to money in the funds in the event of the franchisor's insolvency. This reiterated one of the principles the Wein Report recommended be applied to marketing funds through the Code. They were:  a franchisor should separately account for marketing and advertising costs; contributions to marketing funds from individual franchisees should be held on trust for franchisees generally, with the franchisor to have wide discretion as to how to expend the funds (subject to principle ‘e’ below);  company-owned units must be required to contribute to the marketing and advertising fund on the same basis as franchised units;  the marketing and advertising fund should only be used for expenses which are clearly disclosed to franchisees by way of the disclosure document, and which are legitimate marketing and advertising expenses;  a once yearly independent audit should be conducted on marketing funds over a certain threshold value, with no capacity for franchisees to vote against such an audit; and the results of the audit (where applicable) and other detailed information about the expenditure of marketing and advertising funds should be made available to franchisees yearly.  Hadfield, 966.  Jenny Buchan, submission to the [Wein] review p 4. Changes mooted by government: The 2019 Task Force’s Regulation Impact Statement The 2019 Task Force outlined a number of options to address transparency of marketing funds in the Regulation Impact Statement. These included:  Option 3.1.1 Status quo. Under this option, there would be no changes to the Franchising Code. Over time, additional case law could work to improve the understanding of legitimate marketing expenses. Option 3.1.2 Address inconsistency in the Franchising Code on the treatment of marketing funds and increase reporting standards. Under this option the Government would improve consistency within the Franchising Code in relation to the treatment of marketing funds, particularly clauses 15 and 31(Recommendation 6.7), introduce civil pecuniary penalties for a breach of clause 31 (Recommendation 6.8), increase the frequency and standards of reporting of marketing funds (Recommendation 6.9), require master franchisors to meet requirements of marketing funds (Recommendation 6.10), and clarify the distribution of marketing funds in the event of franchisor insolvency (Recommendation 6.12).  Option 3.1.2 (a) Improve consistency within the Franchising Code about the treatment of marketing funds, particularly clauses 15 and 31. The Franchising Code would be changed to clarify obligations with respect to marketing funds, possibly by clarifying what would be ‘meaningful information’ for the purposes of clause 15 of the Franchising Code. This could assist parties in understanding their obligations. Option 3.1.2 (b) Introduce civil pecuniary penalties for a breach of clause 31. Creating a civil pecuniary penalty for marketing fund provisions in clause 31 will deter breaches of the Franchising Code. Penalties for non-compliance may boost confidence in the operation of marketing funds.  Option 3.1.2 (c) Increase the frequency and standards of reporting of marketing funds. Franchisors are currently required to produce annual statements for the use of marketing funds. By increasing the frequency of required reporting to quarterly (Recommendation 6.9), franchisees would have access to more up to date information on the use of marketing funds than is currently required. Stakeholders have submitted that franchisees may have to bear the cost of increased reporting but may not receive an overall benefit from increased information. https://docs.employment.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/final_franchising_ris_-_11112019.pdfOption 3.1.2 (d) Require master franchisors to meet requirements of marketing funds. Improved understanding will likely arise from making the requirements consistent between clause 15 and 31 and ensuring their application to master franchisors (Recommendation 6.10).  Option 3.1.2 (e) Clarify the distribution of marketing funds in the event of franchisor insolvency. Clarifying the distribution of unspent marketing funds (Recommendation 6.12) would give provide greater transparency of the operation of marketing funds in the event of franchisor insolvency. A number of stakeholders have stated that a potential unintended consequence of increasing the administration requirements of managing marketing funds is that, should the costs and risks of administration become too onerous, franchisors may choose not to operate shared marketing funds and instead recoup marketing costs through other means (such as franchise system fees).  Option 3.1.3 Increase awareness and provide guidance around existing legal obligations. Under this option, additional efforts would be made to educate the franchising sector on their existing legal obligations on the use of marketing funds, and clearer guidance could be provided around the preparation of financial statements (Recommendation 6.11). Stakeholders have suggested that improved interpretation of the existing provisions may reduce the incidence of disputes over the use of marketing funds. Case law and court decisions which interpret ‘legitimate marketing expenses’ will provide examples and clearer guidance to the franchising sector. The government’s response was that the Code should be amended.  The Government accepts that a new approach is warranted regarding the regulation of marketing or other cooperative funds. It will amend the Code to make the administration of marketing funds more transparent and ensure that marketing and advertising funds are spent on legitimate expenses related to the marketing and advertising of the franchise system.As we will see, unfortunately for the franchisees of AFD, Recommendation 8 b) that would have ring- fenced money that was paid to the franchisor for the purpose of marketing, was not adopted. The reason for deciding not to require marketing funds to be held in a trust account was stated to be that:  ‘Forward looking franchising regulation’ Commonwealth Government response to the Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, July 2013, 12.  this may result in unintended taxation consequences regarding marketing funds and may increase the compliance costs and risks in a way that is disproportionate to the benefit a trust arrangement would confer on franchiseesVeronica Taylor’s observation that ‘[p]art of the folklore of franchising is the presumed intimacy between the partiesis confirmed by the 2013 government’s optimism on the subject of the use of marketing funds; ‘[a]s a general position, the Government encourages franchisors to consult with franchisees or franchisee representatives on the use of marketing … funds’. Submissions to the 2018 Inquiry demonstrate that this hope proved to be in vain on occasion. Hold marketing funds in trust  The 2013 Wein Review recommended that marketing funds be held as trust funds. In the PJC review, when this possibility was raised, the stakeholders who prevailed argued requiring marketing funds to be formally treated as trust funds would be problematic as:  [T]he additional compliance burdens associated with keeping a trust account may deter franchisors from setting up marketing funds at all. This may deprive franchisees of the transparency provided for relating to marketing by other provisions of the Franchising Code. This could have an impact on taxation arrangements and the treatment from a taxation and accounting perspective. Some stakeholders argued this would significantly increase the legal and administrative burdens on franchisors. If marketing funds were held in trust, this could impact franchisors credit worthiness or the cost of credit for a franchisor.  The current provision states that if 75 per cent of franchisees agree no audit is required, that agreement remains in force for three years. The new requirements will mean that a franchisor will have to conduct a vote each year.   Veronica Taylor, “Continuing Transactions and Persistent Myths: Contracts in Contemporary Japan” Melbourne University Law Review (1993) 19, 352 - 398.  ‘Forward looking franchising regulation’ Commonwealth Government response to the Review of the Franchising Code of Conduct, July 2013, 12.  It was concluded by the PJC that this particular recommendation is unjustified when the potential costs are considered.So, the potential costs were considered but no mention was made of potential benefits. No change was made to the characterisation of the marketing funds paid by franchisees, or franchisors.  In Fairness in Franchising 2019, the issue of marketing funds was highlighted again in Recommendation 6.12 that reads: The committee recommends that the Australian Government clarify, through legislation, the distribution of unused marketing funds in the event of the franchisor winding upIt is worth testing the reasons given for failing to require franchisors to hold marketing funds in trust. Do they hold water? What are the benefits to franchisors and to franchisees? Our analysis in the table below suggests the government’s Task Force has accepted the view of franchisors without rigorously examining their veracity. Justifications for not requiring franchisors to hold marketing levies in trust as outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014 Our analysis  Given franchisors are not required to maintain a marketing fund, the additional compliance burdens associated with keeping a trust account may deter franchisors from setting up marketing funds at all.   This may deprive franchisees of the transparency provided for relating to marketing by other provisions of the Franchising Code. True. Anecdotally the suggestion of Franchise Council of Australia is for franchisors to increase the royalty by the amount formally being the marketing fund to remain unaccountable. Most franchisors do collect fees under the heading of ‘marketing fund’ and thus must ‘maintain a separate bank account for marketing fees and advertising fees contributed by franchisees’.Compliance burdens: The submissions to the PJC, and disclosure documents in the author’s possession indicate there is little transparency currently, so this is not supported.  https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/ems/r5307_ems_33cd0e50-f6ad-4ec0-84a4-7de458c05c7e%22  Competition and Consumer (Industry Codes—Franchising) Regulation 2014, clause 31 (a). Potential impact on taxation arrangements and the treatment from a taxation and accounting perspective.   Would significantly increase the legal and administrative burdens on franchisors. The likely impact, from a tax law and tax law compliance perspective is set out in the four points below. The Task Force could seek advice about any accounting impact from accountants. If marketing funds were held in trust, this could impact franchisors credit worthiness or the cost of credit for a franchisor. A franchisor should not be describing money tagged for marketing for the franchisees’ benefit as equity.  Firstly, the income tax law has some trouble with settling on the correct tax treatment of transactions where a payer pays money to a payee on the “understanding” (condition, requirement, expectation) the payee will use the monies for a particular purpose. The reason is the difficulty in characterising the transaction(s) and the precise legal rights of each party involved (e.g. is payee mere agent for payer in spending payer’s money, has payer’s money become property of payee). However, where the payee (the franchisor) is a trustee of the monies for the payer (the position unsuccessfully argued by the administrators in the Aussie Farmers case), the payee has not made assessable income. The difficulty is when the arrangement contains conditions that fall short of a trust (e.g. charge over monies). It comes down to a case by case situation. However, given all the circumstances surrounding the marketing fund in the Aussie Farmers case and judicial comments made throughout the case, subject to one potential qualification, the franchisors will have made assessable income on those facts. The main reasons are that (a) the money is either the proceeds of its business or a receipt for services (arranging marketing of franchise system for part benefit of franchisee) or a return from letting the franchise use its system, and more importantly and (b) the franchisor became the beneficial owner of the monies (e.g. no trust) because while there was an expected use, the franchisor had wide discretion in its use. The one potential qualification is that because the services of arranging the marketing occur over time (after payment in by franchisees), the tax law may defer assessable income recognition by franchisor over the time it is arranging those services.  Secondly, assuming the potential qualification does not apply, based on just the above, in terms of income tax for the franchisor, the trust situation seems to provide a better tax situation for franchisors because the receipt of the monies from the franchisee is not a taxing point for the franchisor. The situation in the Aussie Farmers case does involve a taxing point for the franchisor. Thirdly, again, assuming the potential qualification does not apply, where the funds are spent fairly quickly after payment in by the franchisee, it probably does not matter from a substantive income tax position whether there is a trust or not. In the trust situation, the receipt and the expenditure of the funds by franchisor is not a taxable event for the franchisor (no assessable income and no deduction). Where there is no trust, the tax treatment should be assessable income to franchisor on receipt and a deduction when monies are spent. But, when there is no trust in existence, a long-time gap between receipt of money and its expenditure means the franchisor is taxed upfront as income, but the deduction is delayed until expenditure occurs. It is here that the trust situation gives the franchisor a better income tax outcome compared to the no trust situation. And finally, what would be the regulatory impact under the Tax Act on the franchisor if the marketing fund was put on a trust footing (as opposed to current arrangements)? Assuming just franchisees’ monies are in this trust, the trust provisions of the Tax Act would apply. The franchisor would be the trustee. The trustee (franchisor) would need to comply with tax record-keeping rules, lodge tax returns for the trust (there would be interest income on the fund balance) and work out who is to be taxed on the income in the fund. So, a small number of tasks may be required to be undertaken that would not otherwise arise in the absence of a trust. There may also be the need for a Corporations Act 2001 report to ASIC. There would be no requirement to report to the overseer of trusts; as there is none, aside from State Supreme Courts.This level of compliance surrounding the trust situation needs to be compared with the level of compliance regarding the provision of an acceptable level of transparency and accountability when there is no trust (the current situation). There is arguably not much difference between the two situations from a regulatory impact perspective. It also needs to be remembered that the parties are largely free to build in as little or as much transparency into the trust as they want, subject to compliance with the legislation. If the parties do not set this out in the trust deed, general law will apply (e.g. trustees must maintain accurate accounts of transactions, accounts must be available to beneficiaries to see). That is, having a trust need not mean depriving beneficiaries of required transparency. Moving on, at a fundamental business model and brand-wide level, the funding, development and implementation of marketing, promotional and advertising activities should be addressed through a process that involves both the franchisor and its franchisees. Individual franchisees’ knowledge and understanding of their markets becomes very significant over time. Marketing the products/ services of franchisees in local areas is thus an activity where franchisees can contribute significantly to the success of a brand.  Unjust enrichment  As suggested earlier, it would be possible to argue that a range of different franchise stakeholders may be unjustly enriched by the marketing fund. These include the franchisors liquidators and, even the franchisor’s employees and the government, but as we saw from the Stay in Bed case, not the franchisees. The authors thank UNSW tax academic Dale Boccabella for his assistance with the tax analysis.  It is conceivable that franchisees could make out a claim in quasi-contract against the administrator or liquidator, for unjust enrichment. This action would theoretically be available to franchisees in Australia, though it has not been tested in the context of insolvency in Australian courts. It depends firstly on the court granting consent to franchisees to embark on litigation against the administrator or liquidator or against the directors or solvent related entities of the failed franchisor. Success in a restitutionary claim based on unjust enrichment depends upon the plaintiff establishing the following elements: Benefit or enrichment [defendant has been enriched by the receipt of a benefit – in the case of the franchisor, an upfront franchise fee that was charged for the right to conduct a franchise for, say, five years, but the franchisor became insolvent after two years – 3/5 of the initial franchise fee, and unexpended marketing fees, could be the starting point] At the plaintiff’s expense Unjust factor (unjust to allow the defendant to retain the benefit); and No bars to the restitutionary claim (no other consideration barring the claim, such as a subsisting valid and enforceable contract between the parties). To succeed in a restitutionary claim all four elements must be satisfied. In the first instance, the plaintiff must prove elements 1-3 on the balance of probabilities. In many cases this would be sufficient. Generally speaking, it is up to the defendant [eg the liquidator of the AFD franchisor] to raise the fourth element. Then the plaintiff [eg the government] must prove element 4. If, on the balance of probabilities, the court is not satisfied that there is no bar to a restitutionary claim, then the plaintiff fails.The use of an unjust enrichment action could be considered by franchisees that recently paid a franchise fee but derived very little benefit prior to the franchisor’s failure. Arguably, the pool of money available to the liquidator to pay creditors is artificially expanded by the  Bruce Moore (ed), The Australian Oxford Dictionary ed, 2010) 479. ‘Quasi-contract (implied contract) a form of the equitable remedy of restitution to restore an innocent party to his previous position.’  P Davenport and C Harris, Unjust Enrichment (1997) 34. franchise fee; thus the liquidator is ‘unjustly enriched’. This was pleaded by a group of franchisees in Ontario, Canada in one of the Country Style Food Services cases. There, whilst the franchisees did not act quickly or cohesively enough to succeed, the court did not rule out unjust enrichment as a possible cause of action for future franchisor insolvency cases’.One example of a franchisee claiming unjust enrichment, in a context unrelated to a marketing fund, occurred in Australia in Wang v HACCP Cleaning Australia Pty Ltd & OrsWang became a cleaning franchisee of HACCP Cleaning in April 2009.  After performing cleaning unsatisfactorily for two clients and losing their business in 2010 and 2011, the franchisor did not allocate any more jobs to Wang. The franchisor went into liquidation in January 2012. The final of five heads of claim by Wang against the franchisor claimed Churning and unjust enrichment.  The claim alleged that HACCP Cleaning received franchise fees from the plaintiff under the two contracts, but then on sold at least one of the contracts soon afterwards “thereby doubling its money unjustly”.  It also alleged that HACCP Cleaning claimed that it was unable to find any replacement contract for the plaintiff yet failed to refund the plaintiff’s money. [para 27] Wang did not satisfyDoyle J ofthe Appellate court that any of his five heads of claim held water, but, ‘even if made out, none of those claims will entitle the plaintiff to recovery of the franchise fees’.Unjust enrichment was pleaded in another franchise case, BSB Pty Ltd v Stan Meyer Pty Ltd, again unsuccessfully.  So, if liquidators, the current creditors and the government are the only ones benefitting from the money franchisees have paid into the marketing fund of an insolvent franchisor what can be done to address franchisees’ reasonable expectations?

Para 42  [2017] VCC 320 Conclusion As documented throughout this article, the issue of misuse of marketing funds has been put to policy makers and those charged with reviewing the industry code since 1993. Unfortunately, in that time, despite many legislative reviews, a profusion of stakeholder submissions and academic commentary, and the recommendation in the Wein Report of 2013, little has changed to ensure that franchisees are protected, and their marketing fund contributions are used ethically. This article has documented the recent debate on changes to the industry code and weighed stakeholder concerns against the need for protection of vulnerable franchisees. It is evident that the current laws are not effective against franchisor opportunism. The answer is not yet another protracted review process with tokenistic signalling that this is an issue that ought to be addressed. Instead real changes are needed. Changes that proactively ensure franchisor accountability and franchisee protection, not only changes that come into effect when it is too late, and a franchisor has become insolvent.

Despite advances in the knowledge management literature, our understanding of the role of the institutional context in knowledge transfer within social entrepreneurship remains inadequate. In particular, further explanation is needed about the role of institutions and the adaptation of the franchise model by social entrepreneurs in Africa. Using the qualitative induction methodology, we examine a social franchise network operating in Africa. Our findings suggest that social franchises respond to institutional frameworks (both formal and informal) to scale up their social impact on African countries. In settings dominated by formal institutions, social franchises transfer and adopt strategic knowledge and expand rapidly through direct franchising. In contrast, in those dominated by informal institutions, social franchises adapt their training strategies and use indirect franchising such as area master franchising. We provide valuable insights into the expansion of a rapidly growing business model within social entrepreneurship, social franchises, and show how this model responds to institutional environments in Africa.  Key words: Institutions, Social franchising, Franchising, knowledge transfer practices, AfricaIntroduction Franchising has been globally acknowledged as an engine for entrepreneurial growth in Western economies. It involves a contractual agreement between two independent parties to use the proven business format from the franchisor for a monetary fee paid by the franchisees (Alon, 2001). Due to its success, it has been adapted into smaller businesses and social enterprises mainly in developing countries as micro-franchising and social franchising, respectively (Crawford-Spencer & Cantatore, 2016; Giudici, Combs, Cannatelli, & Smith, 2018; Tracey & Jarvis, 2007). The franchise model involves the transfer of a business format from the franchisor to the franchisee, with the former providing training to the latter. However, less attention has been paid to the factors that promote and inhibit the transfer of knowledge in social franchises, despite its usefulness in having a social impact (Iddy & Alon, 2019). Prior research indicates that we cannot generalize about the barriers to knowledge transfer (Karagoz, Whiteside, & Korthaus, 2020). For example, existing studies have identified various factors that hinder knowledge transfer in the public sector (Amayah, 2013; Karagoz et al., 2020), higher education (Lockett, Cave, Kerr, & Robinson, 2009; Romano, Del Giudice, & Melita Nicotra, 2014), the oil and gas industries (Olaniran, 2017; Ranjbarfard, Aghdasi, López-Sáez, & López, 2014), ICT (Kukko, 2013), franchising (Iddy, 2020; Khan, 2016; Okoroafor, 2014) and social enterprises (Bloice & Burnett, 2016; Weerakoon, McMurray, Rametse, & Arenius, 2019). However, these studies present findings from developed economies with relatively stable institutional frameworks (Chliova & Ringov, 2017; Liao & Yu, 2012). In developed economies, businesses thrive due to stable institutions that ensure fair play. The situation is different in Africa, which has weak and informal institutions (Chliova & Ringov, 2017). In this situation, social franchises that grow by replicating knowledge struggle to protect their unique knowledge to ensure their competitive advantage (Ringov, Liu, Jensen, & Szulanski, 2017). Most social franchises focus on scaling up their social impact overlooking the institutional limitations where they operate or expand (Desa & Koch, 2014). Informal institutions pose a challenge for contract-based relationships such as franchising in transferring patent knowledge (Baena, 2012; Baena & Cervino, 2014). The role of institutions in the performance of social entrepreneurship has been underexplored in emerging economies, particularly regarding knowledge management (Brookes & Altinay, 2017). While it can be easier to generalize some of the contextual characteristics across Africa (Zoogah & Nkomo, 2013), research exploring country-specific factors needs further attention. Our study, therefore, seeks to answer the questions: How does the institutional environment in Africa affect knowledge transfer and how do social franchises respond to the institutional environment?When investigating these questions, we find that social franchises that expand successfully in Africa's different countries respond to the institutional environment. Some African countries have shown improvement in the formalization of laws and regulations, yet informal institutional frameworks still prevail to a large extent. As a result, we underscore the importance of examining the country-specific institutional environment and how it affects organizational practices. We contribute to a better understanding of how informal institutions in Africa affect social entrepreneurs’ growth. We argue that the failure to adapt a business model to the existing formal and informal institutions will undermine a social entrepreneurship’s growth strategy. The following theoretical section precedes the study’s empirical section, which discusses franchising in Africa, the rationale for social franchises in Africa, and the social franchise network where we collected our data. After that, the research method section is followed by the findings and a discussion about the study’s contributions and limitations, and suggestions for future research. Theoretical framework Institutions  The neo-institutional theory has undergone developmental changes since its inception in the late 1970s (Jepperson, 2002). In early 2010, the theory gained momentum in the organizational and management field (Alvesson & Spicer, 2019; Scott, 2008a). In an earlier explanation of institutional structures, institutional forces were usually equated with formal regulatory frameworks (Meyer & Rowan, 1977). Later on, Scott divided institutions into three groups: cultural-cognitive or mimetic, regulatory (related to DiMaggio and Powell’s (1983) notion of coercive), and normative (Scott, 2001, 2005).  Organizations adopt new structures and practices when entering another country. They do so not necessarily to increase the efficiency or effectiveness of the firm, but rather to comply with the regulations of the country and with its moral and cultural norms (Scott, 2005, 2008b). An organization’s actions are considered legitimate when they correspond to a country’s rules, laws, and monitoring system (Scott, 2008b). The normative element of the institutional environment comprises of socially accepted obligations, for example, through professional certification and accreditation (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Scott, 2005). The cultural-cognitive element emphasizes commonly shared beliefs of the society and taken-for-granted understandings ‘through which meaning is made’ (Scott, 2008b).  Similarly, institutional theorists categorize institutions into formal and informal structures (Morgan & Quack, 2005; North, 1990), which are the terms we shall adopt in this study. Formal and informal institutions include the political system, the legal system, and social and cultural beliefs (North, 1990). Regulatory elements that are formally composed and accepted to guide the legal framework and economic activities of society fall under the formal structures of institutions. Informal structures, on the other hand, comprise of cognitive and normative elements, which are unwritten codes of conduct (traditions, norms, culture, and customs) accepted by society to shape business activities (Scott, 2001). As North (1990) noted, organizations are constrained by either the formal or informal structures of institutions. These structures, however, tend to complement or substitute for each other (Estrin & Prevezer, 2011). Where informal and formal institutions are not incompatible, firms must deal with institutional misalignment (Chaux & Haugh, 2020; Williams & Vorley, 2015) or weak institutions when informal institutions dominate or substitute for formal ones (Estrin & Prevezer, 2011), as in the case of Africa and other developing countries (Zoogah, 2018). Drawing on findings from modern institutions in Western countries, researchers have maintained that strong institutions support organizations, while weak institutions hinder organizational performance (Estrin, Mickiewicz, & Stephan, 2016). Gradually, however, expanding research in weak institutions has determined that, rather than acting as constraints (Zoogah, Peng, & Woldu, 2015), organizations sometimes use weak institutional elements such as corruption to speed up their activities (Bahooa, Alon, & Paltrinieri, 2020; Jiménez & Alon, 2018). For instance, (Mbaku, 2010) showed how corruption can be used to circumvent legislation that has a negative effect on an organization’s profits. In countries with informal institutions, corruption has developed as a social norm to ease the cost of doing business (Zoogah, 2018). Others have gone further, demonstrating that the misalignment between formal and informal institutions might actually provide opportunities to entrepreneurs (Chaux & Haugh, 2020; Williams & Vorley, 2015) and a competitive advantage to MNC subsidiaries (Björkman, Fey, & Park, 2007; Clark & Lengnick-Hall, 2012). Institutions in Africa  Institutional theory is becoming an important perspective in research on Africa due to the distinct aspects of its institutions. However, the extant literature about knowledge management in Africa lacks an institutional perspective (Chliova & Ringov, 2017; Littlewood & Holt, 2018; Rivera-Santos, Holt, Littlewood, & Kolk, 2015; Zoogah et al., 2015). Although prior research generalizes its findings, giving the impression of uniformity in African countries (Zoogah et al., 2015), recent studies have started to recognize the diversity of African countries with different traditions, languages, political, economic, and legal structures (Nkakleu & Biboum, 2019; Zoogah, 2018). Understanding the institutional parameters of each country and how they affect knowledge management in entrepreneurship is of particular interest to organizations seeking to enter the African market (Aliouche, Fernandez, Chanut, & Gharbi, 2015; Rivera-Santos et al., 2015).  Corruption and poverty are still major problems in Africa. The UNDP reports that almost all countries in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from extreme poverty. In 2018 Transparency International stated that 10 out of the 20 most corrupt countries are from sub-Saharan Africa. Corruption and tribalism influence the recruitment process in sub-Saharan African organizations, factors that have a strong effect on knowledge management practices (Parboteeah, Seriki, & Hoegl, 2014). Additionally, unstable rules and regulations, labor regulations, lack of societal and economic support, and the failure to protect property rights reduce entrepreneurial activities by prompting people to seek income from formal employment rather than becoming self-employed (Estrin et al., 2016; Luo, 2020). Deficiencies in contract enforcement, transparency, and corruption have lead organizations to prefer business arrangements such as equity joint ventures (Kamoche & Harvey, 2006; Nkakleu & Biboum, 2019) or low control modes of governance such as master franchising (Koch, Ludvigsson-Wallette, & Nilsson, 2020; Rosado-Serrano, Paul, & Dikova, 2018).  Youth unemployment and lack of access to quality education and training programs in Africa create challenges in finding competent managers with managerial experience (Yessoufou, Blok, & Omta, 2018; Zoogah, Gomes, & Cunha, 2020; Zoogah et al., 2015). The limited education of employees hinders the transfer of knowledge (Chliova & Ringov, 2017). Lack of employment opportunities force young people to engage in informal businesses that are not formally registered with the legal authorities. While corruption influences the quality of judicial procedures and contract enforcement (Dixit, 2015; Knott & Miller, 2006; Zoogah et al., 2015), the failure to register businesses with the authorities limits the extent to which contract terms can be legally enforced (Chliova & Ringov, 2017).  All organizations (franchises and non-franchises) in Africa are subject to the same institutional situation (Scott, 2005). The response to this situation might differ according to the size, origin (foreign or local), and political endorsement of the business. For instance, large firms may respond to both the formal and informal institutional environment by trying to lobby the government to change some of the regulations (Chliova & Ringov, 2017), bribe politicians to establish strong social networks (Zoogah, 2018), or use misalignment as an entrepreneurial opportunity for small entrepreneurs (Camenzuli & McKague, 2015; Chaux & Haugh, 2020). Since entrepreneurship always occurs in a cultural context, understanding the effect of informal African institutions on knowledge management practices is critical to fostering social entrepreneurial growth and eradicating poverty there (Littlewood & Holt, 2018). Method Empirical context Franchising in AfricaThe franchising sector in Africa is growing. Africa is becoming an important market for foreign investors due to the potential growth of the African market (Odusola, 2020; Siggel, Maisonneuve, & Fortin, 2006), evident in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Morocco (Aliouche et al., 2015; Kastner, Mahmoud, Buame, & Gabrah, 2019; Siggel et al., 2006). Furthermore, franchising companies such as Hyatt, Marriott, Radisson, and Keller Williams have recently announced their plans to expand to more than 21 African countries on average, in addition to South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco. Although African entrepreneurs like international brands, being a foreign franchisor does not guarantee success. International franchises, however, face competition from locally developed franchises, which are also rapidly expanding across Africa. For example, in 2015, the Franchise Association of South Africa (FASA), which is the largest so far in Africa, reported that 88 percent of franchises in South Africa are domestic franchisors. This number is increasing and expanding across African countries. Apart from competition, foreign franchises often fail in Africa due to the lack of qualified franchisees, cultural misunderstandings, political instability, low per capita income, corruption, the weak rule of law, limited financial capital, and lack of franchise regulations (Aliouche et al., 2015; Alon, 2004; Siggel et al., 2006). Local franchises might have an added advantage over foreign franchises due to their ability to respond to institutional challenges. Social franchisingAlthough franchising is an inexpensive way to expand internationally (Rosado-Serrano et al., 2018), commercial franchising is very expensive (Kistruck, Webb, Sutter, & Ireland, 2011). This factor might explain why most commercial franchises started to expand to Africa very late. For example, popular brands such as Burger King, McDonald’s, KFC, and 7-Eleven, which require an average investment fee of approximately $2,146,511, are not yet common in Africa (Galic & Notaris, 2020). According to the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the institutional environment of African countries accounts for the limited number of commercial franchises in Africa. Companies find it difficult to function in places where there is weak rule of law, poverty, corruption, illiteracy, and the lack of a general understanding of the franchising concept among policy makers, entrepreneurs, academics and the general population. For example, the World Bank reported in 2015 that 413 million people who live in sub-Saharan Africa subsist on less than $1.90 a day. However, a bucket of five pieces of chicken at KFC in Tanzania is approximately $13. Thus, the African Development Bank (AfDB) stated that the franchise concept must be tailored to satisfy basic needs and target a low-income, rural population. Although the eradication of poverty is a concern for many sub-Saharan African countries and other international agencies, the World Bank also reported that the lack of sustainable solutions for solving social problems is linked to increased poverty. Both researchers and practitioners from different contexts have been inspired to come up with new innovations, know-how, and financial resources that will resolve this issue (Ciambotti & Pedrini, 2019; Desa & Koch, 2014; Si, Ahlstrom, Wei, & Cullen, 2020; Steinfield & Holt, 2019). Researchers in business model innovations have studied adapting the franchising model to not-for-profit organizations (NGOs) as a possible solution (Carril, 2014; Christensen, Parsons, & Fairbourne, 2010; Crawford-Spencer & Cantatore, 2016; Kistruck et al., 2011; Perrigot, 2018).   Social franchising is the use of commercial franchising logics in social enterprises (Christensen et al., 2010; Crawford-Spencer & Cantatore, 2016). Social franchising involves transferring knowledge to replicate the social impact of a well-established social solution (the social franchisor) to another individual or enterprise (the social franchisee) with the same social goals (Cumberland & Litalien, 2019; Ziólkowska, 2018). It enables social enterprises to combat social problems while making social entrepreneurs financially sustainable (Alon & Misati, 2011; Christensen et al., 2010). Unlike commercial franchising, social franchisors help social franchisees with financial capital (Smuts, Beckwith, Nkonyeni, Scheepers, & Bonnici, 2019). Although some social franchises started operation in developed countries, studies indicate the successful adaptability of the social franchising model in the base-of-pyramid (BOP) market (Giudici et al., 2018; Kistruck et al., 2011; Maciejewski, Jaana, Keely, Crowe, & Liddy, 2018). Evidence from the Rosenberg International Franchise Center (\"Franchie Indices,\" 2020) indicates that African countries rank high in the potential of social franchises and low in commercial franchises. However, although social problems look similar in most countries in the BOP market, their institutional settings can yield different outcomes when replicating business templates in different countries (Chliova & Ringov, 2017).  The company: The Alpha social franchise We explored the use of social franchises using a company that we refer to as Alpha. Alpha is a social franchise network in Africa that provides safe drinking water to underserved populations and business opportunities to local entrepreneurs. The company uses the franchise model to stimulate economic growth and create economic independence, while addressing the fundamental problems of unemployment and unsafe drinking water. To help many small entrepreneurs become social franchisees, Alpha co-invests with them by providing a water purification machine and guaranteeing them a start-up loan from micro-credit banks. It is currently operating in seven countries with 122 franchisees and at least 2000 retail points. The more Alpha sells water, the more it reaches a large population, while increasing sales. In doing so, it achieves its social and financial objectives. However, between 2017 and early 2019, Alpha started experiencing stagnation in performance. In an interview with the founder, he partly attributed this situation to inadequate training for franchisees.  As part of its support incentives, Alpha provides on-going monthly training to franchisees and periodically to other employees using the same modules in all countries. Monthly training in Alpha is designed for franchisees. This is because the Alpha franchise contract, like any other franchise contract, requires a franchisee to supervise the store's daily operation. For stores operated by a manager, it is the franchisees' responsibility to pass on the information to the manager after the meeting. The manager then communicates this information to the rest of the team members. Franchisees should gather information from managers and provide feedback to the franchisor (trainer) during the next meeting.   Although the empirical focus here is on the institutional environment of Rwanda and Uganda, Table 1 provides an overview of the institutional environment of the seven countries in which Alpha operates. The table indicates how the company is expanding (the number of franchised units) in an improved institutional setting such as Rwanda and a poor institutional environment such as the DRC in terms of corruption, contract enforcement, and ease of doing business. Additionally, the table also shows the rapid improvement in Tanzania with medium scores of ease-of-doing businesses through area master franchising. Since 2014, when the company started its first franchisees in Rwanda and Uganda, there has been a difference in performance. Growth in Rwanda in terms of the number of franchisees and franchised units has increased compared to Uganda. The difference in performance might be influenced by, but not limited to, the quality of the countries’ institutions. The ease of doing business index, which considers regulatory factors such as the quality of judicial processes, and the costs and time involved in resolving commercial disputes in a local first-instance court, positions Rwanda as the second-best country in sub-Saharan Africa (\"Market Overview,\" 2020). In 2019, the country’s commercial guide for U.S. companies and the International Trade Administration reported that since 2014, Rwanda’s business environment has improved due to reductions in corruption, crime, and political conflicts. Rwanda is the least corrupt country and the only country to score above the global average in East Africa according to (\"Transparency International,\" 2019). In contrast, in Uganda, corruption is still a severe problem. There is little political will to fight it to encourage a friendly business environment. Corruption index ranked Uganda as the third most corrupt country in East Africa, following South Sudan and Burundi (\"Transparency International,\" 2019). In addition, the country’s commercial guide for U.S companies reports that unregistered economic businesses and the sale of smuggled counterfeit products, especially from China, hinder foreign and local producers of consumer goods in Uganda.  The improvement in legal enforcement, corruption levels, and formal registration of businesses in Rwanda might be one of the reasons that Alpha permitted the growth of the company through multi-unit ownership there (Clarkin & Rosa, 2005; Hussain, Sreckovic, & Windsperger, 2018; Koch et al., 2020).

Additionally, we also conducted the interviews with the franchisees and managers separately to highlight the different perspectives of the franchisees, employed managers, and other employees.

Social franchise chains operating in African countries:  Are their social goals aligned with the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals? Abstract Social franchise chains have social goals rather than – or in addition to – commercial or profit-making goals. But are these social goals, targeted by social franchisors, aligned with the SDGs? And if it is the case, with which ones in particular? Based on legitimacy theory, we examine the disclosure of SDG-related information on websites of 69 social franchise chains operating in Africa. Our main findings show that social goals targeted by social franchisors are aligned with certain SDGs, the ones that are general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education. Our paper contributes to the literature on franchising and on the role of the private sector, in particular SMEs and social franchising, in the achievement of SDGs and offers managerial implications. Keywords Social franchising, Sustainable Development Goals, Emerging markets, Africa, Legitimacy Introduction  In the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations has listed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that address inequality (Freistein and Mahlert, 2016). They are considered a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for [everyone]. They address the global challenges [societies] face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice.” The United Nations insists on the fact that “in order to leave no one behind, it is important that [societies] achieve them all by 2030.”Ambassador Joon, President of ECOSOC – UN, emphasized: “Under this backdrop, the role of the private sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), is integral if the international community is to achieve the SDGs by their target date” (Joon, 2018, p. 6). In the same vein, Cheru (2016, p. 1277) stated that “much more work remains to be done to accelerate economic growth and reduce human deprivation in Africa in the coming 15 years. […] This will require […] the involvement of a wide spectrum of actors from the private sector, civil society, philanthropies and governments.” Despite these calls for actions from the private sector and SMEs in particular, “extant international business research hardly covers the private sector’s role in achieving international policy goals” (van Zanten and van Tulder, 2018, p. 208).  In this research, we focus on a specific type of SME, social franchise chains. Indeed, recent academic papers (e.g., Aliouche and Schlentrich, 2015; Asemota and Chahine, 2016; Crawford-Spencer, 2015; Crawford-Spencer and Cantatore, 2016; Kistruck et al., 2011; Naatu and Alon, 2019; Naatu et al., 2020; Perrigot, 2018), as well as trade papers, have addressed the emergence, development, and operation of social franchise chains that try to meet, and often succeed in                                                  https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ meeting, these SDGs. Obviously, as their name indicate, these social franchise chains have social goals rather than – or in addition to – commercial or profit-making goals (Du Toit, 2014; Smith, 2002). Are social goals, targeted by social franchisors, aligned with the SDGs? And if it is the case, with which ones in particular? These are the questions we explore in this paper.  Employing legitimacy theory as our theoretical background, and Africa as our empirical setting, we explore these questions by examining the disclosure of SDG-related information on social franchisor websites. While, in terms of research, there is a growing stream of literature dealing with social franchising (Naatu and Alon, 2019; Perrigot, 2018), as far as we know, there are no papers published on the subject of SDGs in link with social franchise chains.  Franchising provides a specific and relevant context with which to examine SDGs. First, social franchising is an option for replicating and scaling impact and social impact (Asemota and Chahine, 2016), and thus for replicating and scaling social impact in terms of SDG achievement. Second, the actions undertaken to achieve SDGs take place on two levels, the chain and the stores. The impact is then higher than that of a traditional enterprise that is not organized as a chain. Third, the issue of franchisor/franchisee independence is a challenge, as both have to collaborate and work toward the aim of achieving the SDGs in order to succeed. Our empirical study deals with social franchise chains operating in Africa. Our sample includes 69 chains operating in agriculture, clean water and sanitation, education, energy, and healthcare sectors in various countries in Africa. Our main findings confirm that almost all (94.20%) social franchise chains operating in Africa disclose information about at least one SDG on their websites. Social franchisors in Africa thus aspire to contribute to the achievement of certain                                                   We prefer to consider this a representative sample and not the actual amount of social franchise chains operating in Africa, though we have tried to be as exhaustive as possible when compiling the list in case some social franchise chains operating in Africa do not have websites. SDGs. We observed that the SDGs targeted by the majority of franchisors are quite general in nature and not only sector-dependent, except in the case of education.  Our paper contributes to the literature on franchising and SDGs. First, regarding the social franchising stream, based on franchisor disclosure on their websites, we highlight that franchisor social goals are aligned with certain SDGs. Second, regarding the franchising in emerging countries stream of literature, franchising in Africa has not caught the attention of many researchers so far, despite its potential for development (exceptions are Naatu et al., 2020; Perrigot, 2017, 2018). We thus provide evidence for the development of franchise operations in the African continent. Third, regarding the CSR in franchising stream, this paper builds on studies addressing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Social Disclosure (CSD) in franchise chains by focusing on several dimensions, such as environmental and social concerns of SDGs. Fourth, our research also contributes to the limited literature stream on SDGs and, more specifically, the role of the private sector, in particular SMEs, in the achievement of SDGs (Desta and McMaohn, 2015; Mills, 2018; Munro et al., 2017). Our paper also contributes to the practice by providing examples of the types and varieties of social goals social franchisors can pursue. The findings show the potential for such franchise chains to achieve SDGs. Thus, entrepreneurs might be encouraged to launch their franchise concept as franchisors who contribute to SDGs at an international, national, or regional level or to join franchise chains as franchisees who contribute to SDGs at the local level as well. Literature review Franchising in Africa Except for the few studies conducted on franchising in South Africa (Du Toit, 2003; van Wyk and De Jager, 2009), the African continent has not caught the attention of many franchising researchers, despite the development of local and foreign franchise chains in many African countries (Perrigot, 2017). The limited research that has dealt with franchising in African countries, excluding South Africa, has mainly concerned one specific sector: the healthcare sector (an exception is the case of Fan Milk micro-franchised chain selling ice cream and yogurt in western Africa by Christensen et al. (2010)). Prata et al. (2005), relying on data from The World Bank's Health Nutrition and Population Poverty Thematic Reports on 22 African countries, concluded that “franchising has the greatest potential for integration into large-scale programmes in Africa to address critical illnesses of public health importance” (p. 274). Perrigot (2018) examined the franchise business model of one chain of clinics, CFWclinics, in Kenya. She concluded that social franchising seems to work no differently from franchising in more traditional sectors, at least in terms of know-how, assistance, brand name, and franchisor/franchisee and franchisee/franchisee relationships. Naatu et al. (2020) showed, through a case study conducted on an anonymous micro-franchising chain in the healthcare sector in Rwanda, the importance of relying on a public-private partnership or having a governmental endorsement to succeed. Social franchising and SDGs Franchising in the healthcare sector is often referred to as, or part of, social franchising. Social franchising is defined as “the application of commercial franchising methods and concepts to achieve socially beneficial ends” (Temple, 2011, p. 3). Put differently, “social franchises are a new type of hybrid organisations and social enterprises that adopts franchising strategy to provide social goods and services in underserved areas” (Naatu et al., 2020, p. 1). Social franchising can be a relevant and powerful means for providing access to quality healthcare services, drinking water, solar energy, and education at affordable prices to many people in emerging countries (Perrigot, 2018). Various authors have tried to compare social franchising to social enterprise (Crawford-Spencer, 2015; Du Toit, 2014) or social entrepreneurship (Aliouche, 2015), have distinguished between for profit and not for profit organizations (Crawford-Spencer and Cantatore, 2016); and have pointed out the stages of social franchising (Asemota and Chahine, 2016).  Social franchisors often use micro-franchising, i.e., “a business model adaptation that helps low-income individuals overcome non credit-related barriers to entry in obtaining employment.” (Chistensen et al., 2010, p. 595). More specifically, microfranchising “provides, via sale, a vetted and replicable turnkey business to buyers in subsistence markets who commit to follow the model.” (Chistensen et al., 2010, p. 595). Social franchisors have then two types of social goals, vis-à-vis the customers (access to basic products and/or services) and the micro-franchisees (access to a job) as summarized in Chart 1. Chart 1: Social franchisors and their social goals What we explore in this paper is the goals of these social franchisors through the lens of SDGs, which have been the focus of governments and enterprises in the last few years but that have been largely ignored in the literature on small business management. In September 2015, in Social franchisorsBasic products and/or services offered to customersJobs offered to micro-franchiseesSocial goals their agenda for sustainable development, the United Nations and its Member States set up a plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity over the next 15 years. This agenda included 17 SDGs built on the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. These SDGs were directed toward pinpointing and carrying out essential actions at the global level (Joon, 2018). They included areas such as poverty reduction, access to education, healthcare, energy, and climate change. As the 17 SDGs are interconnected, they need to be addressed quickly and together (Sachs et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). The United Nations has asserted that national governments and international organizations are not able to achieve these SDGs alone. They need the contributions of various stakeholders: the private sector, international institutions, academia, NGOs, among others (Joon, 2018). The 2030 Agenda explicitly recognizes the role of the private sector in implementing its goals, for instance SDGs 8 – Decent work and economic growth, 9 – Industry, innovation, and infrastructure and 17 – partnerships for the goals. But even to achieve the other SDGs, the role of the private sector, and particularly SMEs in emerging markets, is essential. As such, there have been calls for “aligning the small business community alongside the United Nations on [their] work toward sustainable development” (Joon, 2018, p. 6). SMEs include many types of enterprises, among which are both sides of franchising, that is, not only franchisee enterprises but also franchisor enterprises. Franchisee enterprises are often small businesses run by franchisees or micro-franchisees who are independent entrepreneurs running their businesses under a certain brand and benefiting from the franchisor brand, know-how and assistance. These local SMEs can be operated by franchisees or micro-franchisees working alone in many cases, and having employees in some cases. The franchisor enterprises, contrary to what one might imagine, are often SMEs as well. Usually the franchisor employs a few staff members at the franchise chain headquarters, mainly in the development, management, and marketing departments. Theoretical background Legitimacy theory is the most widely used framework for explaining enterprise disclosures about their environmental and social behaviors and, more broadly, their CSR practices (Gray et al., 1995; Hooghiemstra, 2000). The applications of legitimacy theory are varied. For instance, they can apply to enterprises in mining, oil, mineral extraction, forestry, gas, chemicals, metals, and autos, engineering and construction, service, and food and retailing (Guthrie and Parker, 1989; Adams et al., 1998; Patten, 1991, 1992; Deegan et al., 2002; O’Donovan, 2002). Legitimacy is defined as “a generalised perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions” (Suchman, 1995, p. 574). A key concept of legitimacy theory is the existence of a social contract between an enterprise and the society in which it operates (Deegan, 2000; Deegan, 2002; Mathews, 1993; Patten, 1991; 1992). This social contract is used to represent the expectations society has about how an enterprise should conduct its operations (Deegan, 2000; Mathews, 1993). Enterprise survival is thus dependent on the extent that the enterprise operates “within the bounds and norms of [the] society” (Brown and Deegan, 1998, p. 22), corresponds to the society’s expectations (Deegan et al., 2002), and thus benefits from the support of the society (Deegan, 2014). Or, put differently, the survival of an enterprise can be threatened if the society perceives that it has breached its social contract (Deegan, 2002). In more detail, according to Shocker and Sethi (1973, p. 97), “any social institution – and business is no exception – operates in society via a social contract, expressed or implied, whereby its survival and growth are based on: (1) the delivery of some socially desirable ends to society in general; and (2) the distribution of economic, social or political benefits to groups from which it derives its power.” CSD entails providing information, in reports and/or on corporate websites, legitimizing enterprises’ behaviors by influencing their various stakeholders’ and the society’s perceptions of these enterprises (Neu et al., 1998). These enterprises expect to be considered “good corporate citizen[s]” and have their actions justify their continued existence (Campopiano and De Massis, 2015). This is particularly true for social franchisors operating in Africa when disclosing information on SDGs. Indeed, these franchisors expect to be considered “good corporate citizen[s]” by offering products and/or services such as water, solar lamps, education, and health care of high quality at affordable prices to local customers, and providing franchising and employment opportunities to local communities. The various stakeholders and the society these franchisors interact with include local governments, the partnered NGOs, donors and potential ones, franchisees and potential ones, employees and potential ones, and customers and potential ones.  In this paper, we focus on social franchisors’ CSD on SDGs that have not been the focus of academic research on small business management despite the call from the UN. We intend to fill this gap by examining the question: “Are social goals, targeted by social franchisors, aligned with the SDGs? And if it is the case, with which ones in particular?” Methodology  We needed first to build our “sample” of social franchise chains operating in Africa. We proceeded with a series of searches on several search engines, and a combination of specific franchising-, industry- and Africa-related keywords. Our list included 69 social franchise chains operating in various industries (such as, agriculture, clean water and sanitation, education, energy, and healthcare) and in various countries in Africa (Burkina-Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). In addition to the industries and the countries, these 69 franchise chains were varied in terms of experience (number of years since the start of franchising), size (number of franchised units), and organizational form (e.g., franchising only, franchising and company ownership, franchising and micro-franchising). On each of the 69 franchise chain websites, we searched for information addressing one or more of the 17 SDGs. We included explicit information with exact references to the SDGs, as well as implicit information, for instance, with expressions such as “stopped spending money on kerosene,” “create permanent jobs,” “employment opportunities,” “ability to earn a living,” “increase monthly income,” or “empowers micro-entrepreneurs to earn an income” in reference to SDG n°1 – No poverty. We found that 65 social franchise chains operating in Africa disclosed information on at least one SDG on their websites. For each of these 65 franchise chains disclosing information on at least one SDG, we copied and pasted the information (that is, a paragraph, a sentence, a part of a sentence, or a combination) in an Excel file. We thus gathered a corpus of qualitative data with information referring to one or several of the 17 SDGs.  Findings  SDG information disclosure (presence or not) on social franchisor websites According to Table 1, around three quarters of the franchisors disclosed information about reduced inequalities (79.71%), partnerships for the goals (79.71%), and sustainable cities and communities (71.01%). More than half of the franchisors provided information about good health and well-being (69.57%), decent work and economic growth (69.57%), poverty eradication (56.52%), and industry, innovation, and infrastructure (56.52%). About half of the franchisors disclosed information on quality education (49.28%) and gender equality (44.93%). We observed that the SDGs targeted by the majority of social franchisors were quite general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education.  Moreover, we observed social franchisors disclosed information on up to 13 SDGs. About 10% of the franchisors disclosed information on four SDGs (8.70%), six SDGs (8.70%), seven SDGs (11.59%), nine SDGs (10.14%), ten SDGs (11.59%), or eleven SDGs (8.70%). And about 20% of the franchisors disclosed information about eight SDGs (17.39%). To sum up, there was no single trend in terms of communicating about SDGs among chains, but, globally, many of the social franchisors conveyed their interest in certain SDGs, underlining the alignment between franchisor social goals and SDGs.  << Insert Table 1 here >> Main SDG information disclosure (examples of content) on franchisor websites Reduced inequalities and partnerships for the goals A total of 79.71% of the chains disclosed information about SDG10 – Reduced inequalities and SDG17 – Partnerships for the goals on their websites.  Regarding reduced inequalities, they pointed out that they addressed the “bottom of the pyramid,” the underserved, vulnerable, and marginalized communities. For instance, Chain #31 disclosed the following: “[Brand] has developed an innovative distribution network that brings life-changing products to the people who need them most, that is to say to the last-mile delivery low-income communities.” Chain #5 mentioned: “In order to expand access to vision care and eyeglasses for the BoP customer, [Brand] brings vision campaigns to rural and urban communities that have limited access to eye care services.”  In link with reduced inequalities, customer locations were also referred to. Indeed, chains often specified that they served people in remote and rural areas in addition to urban, peri-urban, sub-urban areas, and townships. For instance, we found the following mentions: “Our [Brand] clinics promote the well- being of the undeserved by providing access to quality reproductive healthcare for all regardless of location or ability to pay.” [#20] Or, “In [year], [group name] initiated a mobile outreach service strategy through its [Brand] social franchise clinical network to expand access to FP [Family Planing] in [Country]’s under-served rural areas.” [#16] Or, “800 solar lamps were generously donated and distributed by [partnered organization name] as part of their project to help marginalised rural communities like the [nationality].” [#42] Or, “Drawing on the principles of successful franchising around the world, we are building a franchise network of agri-dealers located in rural, undeserved areas of [Country].” [#63]  A few chains in the energy sector specifically targeted refugees as potential customers, Chain #33 specified: “In [year], we had our first opportunity to partner with the Red Cross International to implement solar kiosks in one of the refugee camps in [Country]”. A few others focused on people with disabilities as potential micro-franchisees, for instance, Chain #33 also mentioned: “[...] That empowers mostly women and people with disabilities using a micro franchise business model.”  Regarding partnerships for the goals, the partners consisted of various types: governments, NGOs, aid agencies, academic institutions, private enterprises, insurance enterprises, influencers, and donors. For instance, we found the following mentions: “[Brand] works with a strong network of NGOs and governments.” [#2] Or, “Collaboration – connecting communities, NGOs, cooperates, students, public bodies and individuals to create the best possible solutions.” [#32]  These partnerships were concerned with innovations and the launch of new products and/or services (e.g., “This success was achieved in collaboration with a number of partners including mobile network operators, banks, implementing partners, community leaders and influencers.” [#9]), funding of projects (e.g., “More than 95 percent of our funding comes from governments, bilateral and multilateral international organizations, and foundations.” [#58] Or, “[Brand] is reliant on funding (until we reach 50 Clinics in the Network) from donors […] in order to expand the Network.” [#17]), and product distribution (e.g., “[Brand] partners with non-governmental organizations, governments, social enterprises and private businesses to distribute eyeglasses using their existing distribution channels. By leveraging existing distribution channels, as seen in our partnerships [...] we are able to greatly expand our reach into countries and areas of countries where we do not have an on-the-ground presence. This increases the distribution of eyewear to the BoP consumer while keeping costs low.” [#5]).  Partnerships for the goals could be local, national, and international, as highlighted on Chain #9 website: “Our programs have been successful as a result of active collaboration and the strengthening of partnerships with a number of public and private sector organisations, both local and international.”  Sustainable cities and communities A total of 71.01% of the chains disclosed information about SDG11 – Sustainable cities and communities on their websites. They mainly focused on contributing to sustainable communities by providing these communities with health services, education, and solar energy as well as entrepreneurial opportunities. Chain #32 for instance disclosed: “To help development organisations build sustainable and independent communities.” Or Chain #42 indicated: “[Brand] will further strengthen communities from the inside by increasing our support for local economies, to drive greater change, create more opportunities and generate more income for those who deliver solar energy with us.”  Good health and well-being, and decent work and economic growthIn equivalent proportions, 69.57% of the chains disclosed information about SDG3 – Good health and well-being and SDG8 – Decent work and economic growth on their websites.  Regarding good health and well-being, for chains operating in the health sector, they provided access to high-quality healthcare services at affordable prices. Many of them focused on reproductive health and family planning services, others on children’s health, and a few on menstrual issues. For instance, we found the following mentions: “It uses an innovative social franchise strategy under the [Brand] label to improve access, equity in reproductive health and child survival with the distribution of many products.” [#13] Or, “We also focus on reproductive health, family planning, maternal, new born and child health, as well as prevention and control of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.” [#60]  Moreover, some franchisors from other industries indirectly contributed to the better health of the population by providing light and equipment to clinics (e.g., “[Brand] means our lights and medical equipment always function to help us to do life-saving work! For example, before, it was really hard for our maternity ward to deliver babies safely, now with our [Brand] system we are much better equipped to work 24 hours a day with the lighting we need!” [#36]), sanitation for homes (e.g., “To provide affordable top-quality mobile/portable toilets. To maintain and sustain a clearer and healthier environment.” [#47]), or by proposing products that reduce the negative impact of others on health (e.g., “Solar lighting reduces the risk of fire, lung damage, eye strain and eliminates toxic, poisonous kerosene from the home. […] Replacing kerosene or paraffin with portable, affordable solar lights improve health, makes a home safer.” [#37]). Some franchisors also wanted to empower people in health improvement, such as indicated on Chain #7 website: “[Brand] [Country] has a mission to empower [nationality] particularly the poor and vulnerable to lead healthier lives.”  Regarding decent work and economic growth, some of franchisors aspired to provide Africans with decent jobs as either employees or franchisees or micro-franchisees. Disclosures for instance include: “[Brand] franchisees make money while solving their communities’ issues, generating hundreds of new local jobs and igniting a virtuous cycle of wealth generation for themselves and their communities.” [#43] Or, “Other beneficiaries of the business will be franchise holders themselves and their staff, with over many jobs created by the franchise business in four years. Qualified veterinary personnel will be recruited as franchisees; and by including animal health technicians as well as vets...” [#50]  Social franchisors provided support and training from the perspective of capacity building, as illustrated by Chain #54 mentioned: “The principals and practitioners learn new skills to implement in their communities to ensure sustainable businesses [branded name centers] and make a difference in the lives of those around them.”  All these actions support economic growth. No poverty, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure A total of 56.52% of the chains disclosed information about SDG1 – No poverty and SDG9 – Industry, innovation, and infrastructure on their websites.  Regarding no poverty, some chains aimed to reduce poverty by providing the population with affordable products and/or services or benefiting them from savings acquired by lowering consumption of other types of products/services that are more expensive or less respectful of the environment. An example is from Chain #34 website: “[Brand] uses a network of local franchises to rent out lights for a price that is similar or even cheaper than kerosene or candles. With no upfront investments, our customers can enjoy better quality lighting.”  The contribution of the franchise chains to poverty alleviation could be considered at an entrepreneurial level as well; that is, through the franchisees and the micro-franchisees. Indeed, some chains offered entrepreneurial opportunities to franchisees and micro-franchisees to help them rise above the poverty level, Chain #34 for instance disclosed: “Whilst working for [Brand], [First name of a franchisee] saved enough money to build a house for him and his wife.”  A focus on women entrepreneurship was also highlighted through social franchisors providing women with franchising opportunities, as suggested here: “To empower black women, build a sustainable network of nurse owned and operated primary healthcare clinics nationally and create permanent jobs.” [#17] Finally, at the employee level, franchising offered job opportunities for employees of franchisees and micro-franchisees to also give them the opportunity to work their way out of poverty. For instance, Chain #44 indicated: “These micro-entrepreneurs, [Brand] Operators, have created 175 jobs for neighbors who run their daily business operations.”  Regarding industry, innovation, and infrastructure, most innovations concerned business models and concepts, as illustrated by these numerous examples: “It uses an innovative social franchise strategy under the [Brand] label to improve access, equity in reproductive health and child survival with the distribution of many products.” [#13] Or, “Our technical expertise, marketing acumen and strong relationships with franchisees has kept us on the cutting edge of healthcare innovation since the launch of our first franchise in [Country] in [year].” [#58] Or, “[Brand name]’s proposed innovation is to establish a micro franchise model in sub Saharan Africa for agricultural inputs and market linkages.” [#52] Or, “The concept is innovative not for its technological aspects, but rather for its model of distributing electricity and energy services, with the goal of reaching the majority of the local population, particularly the most vulnerable.” [#31] Quality education A total of 49.28% of the chains disclosed information about SDG4 – Quality education on their websites. Those operating in the education sector provided access to education services for every child, whether in urban or rural areas, with a focus on quality (content of the courses and training of the teachers) and at affordable prices. Chain #54 for instance disclosed: “We aim to achieve our vision through providing quality whole school teacher training and mentoring to early childhood development centres across [Country] in rural, townships and suburban areas.”  Some franchisors from other industries indirectly contributed to bettering the education of children through the provision of electricity or equipment to schools (e.g., “[Brand] electrified 2 schools by building a kiosk together with [partner name] and [partner name].

Kids therefore now enjoy proper lighting inside the classrooms and screens on which teachers can show them educational movies.” [#34]) and/or supplies of lamps for home study (e.g., “Now that they have their own solar lamps, kids can do their homework, read, write stories, draw pictures and help their parents with tasks in the evening.” [#42]). A few franchisors also indirectly provided better health conditions or made jobs available to parents that allowed them to pay for the education of their children. A couple of other franchisors aimed at educating older people from the perspective of capacity building. Gender equality A total of 44.93% of the chains disclosed information about SDG5 – Gender equality on their websites. Some franchisors focused on gender equity in terms of access to health services, contraception, or education. Chain #1 indicated: “When contraception use increases, states can have [...] less gender inequality.”  The goals of various chains were to empower women, e.g., “To empower black women, build a sustainable network of nurse owned and operated primary healthcare clinics nationally and create permanent jobs.” [#17] Chain #24 also disclosed: “Given the historical injustices on women, [Brand] believes in working with men to stimulate gender equity and ultimately contributing to the achievement of gender equality in economic, political and cultural issues.”  Franchisors promoted gender equity in terms of employment and entrepreneurial opportunities (e.g., “Each micro-enterprise is owned and operated by groups of women. This provides full-time employment to local women […].” [#49]), and, on occasion, access to loans (e.g., “Microloans are targeted to meet the needs of women.” [#60]). Discussion  Summary of findings Our findings show that social goals targeted by social franchisors are aligned with certain SDGs. The majority of franchisors targeted SDGs that were general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education. Indeed, as indicated in Chart 2, the SDGs most often targeted are: reduced inequality, partnerships for the goals, sustainable cities and communities, good health and well-being, decent work and economic growth, poverty reduction, industry, innovation and infrastructure, quality education, and gender equality.  Chart 2: Social franchisors and their social goals through the lens of SDGs Contributions to the literatureOur paper offers contributions to the literature on franchising, first, by enriching the stream on social franchising. Social franchise chains have a social mission, explicit or not, that can be source of conflicts (Tracey and Jarvis, 2007) but also source of innovation (Giudici et al., 2018). We demonstrated that, in link with their social missions, social franchisors in Africa disclose SDG-related information on their websites, and thus support, or have the willingness to support, the achievement of SDGs. Their social goals thus correspond to certain SDGs. Secondly, our research enriches the literature on franchising in emerging countries (Alon and Welsh, 2002; Kaufmann and Leibenstein, 1988; Welsh et al., 2006) and in Africa (Naatu et al., 2020; Perrigot, 2017; 2018), that is scarce, despite its potential for development and the academic interest in Social franchisorsReduced inequalityPartnerships for the goalsSustainable cities and communitiesGood health and well-beingDecent work and economic growthPoverty reductionIndustry, innovation and infrastructureQuality educationGender equalitySocial goals franchising in other emerging markets such as Brazil (Bitti et al., 2019) or China (Jeon et al., 2016; Grünhagen et al., 2012). Thirdly, this paper builds on the research dealing with CSR and CSD in franchise chains (Meiseberg and Ehrmann, 2012; Perrigot et al., 2015) by focusing on several dimensions, including the environment (e.g., climate action) or social aspects (e.g., gender equality) of the SDGs.  Our paper also adds to the limited literature on SDGs and, more specifically, on the role of the private sector, in particular SMEs and franchisors, in the achievement of SDGs (Desta and McMaohn, 2015; Mills, 2018; Munro et al., 2017). Most research on SDGs focused on one SDG only (e.g., zero hunger for Dawson et al. (2019) or Tura (2019), affordable and clean energy for Shen and Power (2017)).  Contributions to the practice Our paper contributes to the practice by providing evidence of the types and varieties of SDGs social franchisors can pursue. We show the potential of such social franchise chains to achieve SDGs. Our findings can encourage entrepreneurs to either launch their franchise concepts as franchisors who contribute to the achievement of SDGs at international, national, or regional levels, or join franchise chains as franchisees who contribute at the local level. We also show that franchising as a business model can be adapted to respond to local needs using social franchising. It suggests a large range of products and/or services where franchising can be applied. Finally, this paper can help governments and public organizations in developing countries that often only associate franchising with hospitality and retail sectors to better understand and assess the role of franchising in achieving social goals in general, and SDGs in particular. Limitations and tracks for future research Our research has some limitations. On the one hand, some are linked to the nature of the data. Indeed, we relied on data disclosed by franchisors on the Internet at a given time. We observed the disclosure of SDG-related information and not the SDG achievement; this, of course, constituted a limit even though website observations were used in various papers dealing with CSD (Axjonow et al., 2018; Perrigot et al., 2015). Case studies, interviews or a questionnaire-based survey on social franchisors and/or their franchisees would better assess franchise chain SDGs orientation. In order to minimize subjectivity in the interpretation of SDGs-related information, we used a codebook and the two authors were involved in the data collection and categorization check. We could also go further in the analysis of the communication and the achievement of some specific SDGs. An in-depth investigation of SDG5 – Gender equality could be, for instance, conducted in link with women entrepreneurship that has attracted significant attention in the African context (e.g., Amine and Staub, 2009). Moreover, this data provided a snapshot at a given time of social franchisors communicating on the SDGs. Comparing disclosure and achievements after a certain period of time (a few years) through a questionnaire-based survey and/or an analysis of CSR reports would help to understand the process of achieving SDGs, and not only the communication on SDGs. Furthermore, franchisors do use their websites to attract donors, partners, and franchisee candidates. They are likely to overestimate their contributions to SDGs to appear as responsible franchisors and to project a better image vis-à-vis these stakeholders. Finally, another limitation deals with the focus on Africa. We could enlarge the research to other emerging markets in order to assess if social franchisors in other regions target SDGs as well. Conclusion This paper is a first attempt to demonstrate the role of social franchising and, more broadly, the role of small businesses, in promoting SDGs. Our findings show that social goals of franchisors operating in the social sector in Africa are aligned with certain SDGs, those that are general in nature and not just sector-dependent, except in the case of education. They were the following: reduced inequality, partnerships for the goals, sustainable cities and communities, good health and well-being, decent work and economic growth, poverty reduction, industry, innovation and infrastructure, quality education, and gender equality. More research on this topic is needed.
